As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.","A sweeping proposal to provide up to $350 million to private companies to help them build advanced nuclear power generation plants in Texas is one step away from reaching Gov. Greg Abbott's desk after the House author said Thursday that he expects the chamber to accept tweaks made by the Senate.

""Yessir,"" state Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, told the American-Statesman in a text message response to a question about whether he'll recommend sending the Senate's version of the bill to the governor. Abbott signaled early in the legislative session that he looks forward to signing such a measure into law.

House Bill 14, by Harris and sponsored in the Senate by Georgetown Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner, would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and the Advanced Nuclear Development Fund under the governor's office. The new agency and funding arm would assess the need for additional nuclear generation or explore ways to promote future plant construction.

The bill sets up guidelines and benchmarks for companies planning to develop nuclear plants to help meet Texas' seemingly insatiable appetite for electric power, and it makes available public financial assistance for both planning and constructing power plants.

""Advancements in nuclear energy offer a promising opportunity to strengthen our electric grid with reliable, dispatchable generation while supporting the growth of this innovative industry,"" Schwertner said as he explained the Senate version of HB 14.

Both chambers passed the bill with bipartisan support, though there was some skepticism expressed about the funding provisions.

Grants vs. loan to promote nuclear development

""Would it not make more sense to maybe do a revolving loan so that they (power companies) would pay them back and we could re-enter and save more money into the system and encourage more nuclear development?"" state Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, asked Schwertner.

The proposed grant system would be a more persuasive tool, Schwertner responded. Plus, he added, the legislation contains payback provisions if companies do not deliver what they promised.

""They do have risk,"" he said.

Under HB 14, the state Public Utility Commission will develop a framework to tie grant amounts to the amount of electric generation a project would produce.

Why Abbott wants a 'nuclear renaissance'

In his State of the State address shortly after the Legislature convened in January, Abbott called for a ""nuclear renaissance"" in Texas to ensure that the rapidly growing state can meet the demand for power that comes with not only adding to its population, but also attracting more commercial and industrial development.

Texas is home to two nuclear power plants, but both are aging. The Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant's first phase was completed in 1990 after several delays and setbacks since construction began in 1974. The second phase of the plant, which is about 60 miles southwest of Fort Worth, went online in 1993.

The South Texas Project in Matagorda County, about 90 miles south of Houston, began operations in 1988.

As of last year, there were 54 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 94 nuclear power reactors in 28 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Illinois has 11 reactors, the most of any state. The nation's largest nuclear power source, the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, has four reactors. The average age of all U.S. nuclear plants is around 42.

What nuclear power projects are pending in Texas?

Reed Clay, president of the Texas Nuclear Alliance, called the legislation ""a giant leap forward for our state and our country."" He predicted it would revive an industry that ""was all but dead for decades.""

""With the passage of H.B. 14 and associated legislation, Texas is positioned to lead a nuclear renaissance that is now rightly seen as imperative for the energy security and national security of the United States,"" Clay said in a statement to the Statesman.

Meanwhile, Texas A&M University's research-focused RELLIS campus near the system's flagship institution is working to develop a nuclear generation project just a fraction of the size of traditional nuclear plants like those in Comanche Peak, and the South Texas Project. The university's permit is awaiting approval from the NRC. Also, Natura Resources is seeking federal approval for a nuclear plant in Abilene.

The first small modular reactor in Texas will be located on Dow's Seadrift plant just north of San Antonio Bay near Victoria. Dow is partnering with the company X-energy on the project that was bolstered by an initial $80 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department. The formal permit application was filed with the NRC in March.","https://www.statesman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/NAAS/83926071007-20250523-t-125100-z-2023065423-rc-2-alaaa-1-ie-1-rtrmadp-3-usastocksnuclearstocks.JPG?crop=5544,3119,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 18:08:31.313484

On Wednesday, Talon Metals Corp. signed a land-use agreement to build a $365 million processing facility at the former Westmoreland Beulah Mine, which closed in 2021.

The Beulah Mineral Processing Facility (BMPF) will handle nickel and copper — vital materials used in electric vehicle batteries, renewable energy systems, stainless steel and military technologies. Construction is expected to begin in 2027, with the aim of supporting national energy independence and revitalizing the local economy.

Talon Metals, a Minnesota-based company, plans to repurpose approximately 256 acres of the former coal mine site, citing the area’s existing infrastructure as a major advantage. The company will transport raw materials by rail from its proposed Tamarack mine in Minnesota — a joint venture with Rio Tinto — to Beulah via BNSF Railway.

“We have the infrastructure here,” said Beulah Mayor Sean Cheatley. “Everything’s there—they don’t have to do any more ground work. It’s going to bring more jobs to the area and bolster our economy.”

Talon estimates the project will create around 150 full-time jobs, with several hundred more expected during construction.

The BMPF is backed by a $115 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, awarded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Talon President Mike Kicis called the federal support “essential” to moving the project forward.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke at the announcement ceremony, praised the DOE for supporting North Dakota’s role in critical minerals development — despite having voted against the infrastructure law while serving in the U.S. House.

In a 2021 statement, Armstrong said, “We cannot continue to spend money we don’t have and saddle future generations with the consequences of reckless spending.”

Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer supported the Senate version of the bill and have voiced strong backing for the project.

“This is a priority project, nationally, in terms of manufacturing critical minerals instead of getting them from places like China and Russia,” Hoeven said. “So, this is a big deal — for the Hazen and Beulah area, for North Dakota and for our country.”

Although the Beulah facility has local support, its viability hinges on approval of the Tamarack mine in Minnesota, currently under environmental review by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.

The proposed mine has drawn opposition from Native American groups and environmental organizations concerned about its impact on wild rice habitats and water sources. Talon spokesperson Jessica Johnson said the company revised its mine design after receiving more than 1,600 public comments, opting for an underground structure with an enclosed entrance to reduce pollution and protect water quality.

“We’re very hopeful that it will go through,” Johnson said. “We’ve put a lot of effort into mine design to address environmental concerns brought to us.”

If the Tamarack mine is not approved, Talon says it is exploring other domestic sources for critical minerals, though Tamarack remains the “primary focus.”

At the Beulah site, Talon plans to use dry stacking — a method of dewatering and compacting mine tailings — to manage waste. Though considered safer than traditional slurry storage, dry stacking can still pose a risk of heavy metal leaching during rain or snowmelt. To address this, the company is researching the use of fly ash from local coal plants to chemically stabilize the tailings.

Johnson likened the stabilizing effect to “taking Tums for an upset stomach.”

Talon is also exploring a “Full Value Mining Scenario” that could include building a byproduct processing facility to extract cobalt, iron and other materials from tailings. This facility might also produce cement alternatives for road construction and carbon storage materials, though no budget or timeline has been set.

If both the BMPF and Tamarack mine are approved, construction on each could begin around the same time in 2027, with operations starting as early as 2028. The Beulah facility would help fulfill Talon’s contract to supply Tesla with 75,000 metric tons of nickel concentrate over six years.

“This is about more than just one plant,” said Johnson. “It’s about building a secure, sustainable supply chain for the technologies that are shaping our future.”

Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project’s environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That’s far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area’s geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda,” she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They’ve had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission’s permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state’s contested case process.

President Trump’s vision to unleash American energy and ensure U.S. global dominance can be realized by embracing the resilience of nuclear energy. Indeed, Mr. Trump can usher in America’s new economic, military and energy renaissance and forge a new era of American prosperity by embracing a new American nuclear future. He can make a strong case to his fellow citizens that there is no American dream without American atomic energy.

The ideal venue for President Trump to share his vision for “Energizing America” through nuclear energy should be from the deck of a nuclear-powered U.S. submarine. He can demonstrate the importance of and support for America’s nuclear renaissance by pointing out that America’s dominance of the global sea lanes has been made possible by nuclear energy, which ironically is also America’s largest source of clean energy. President Trump can argue that if the U.S. fails to lead in delivering nuclear technology, U.S. industries will struggle to compete, the U.S. economy will falter, and as a result, U.S. security at home and abroad will be severely weakened.

The good news is that there is bipartisan support in Congress to significantly expand America’s domestic capacity to generate reliable electricity, always on, and available without risk of outage. According to Senator Risch of Idaho, nuclear energy is the definitive solution to meet President Trump’s vision of making America great again. For example, as AI transforms our world, revolutionizes industries from health care to national security, and reshapes how we live and communicate, our dependence on electricity becomes critical.

Indeed, the race for AI dominance has launched a long-term stampede to connect to America’s vast electricity grid. Tech companies and data center providers need massive amounts of power as soon as possible. Trends suggest that by 2030, data centers for training AI models will require more than 5 gigawatts of electricity, which is about what Manhattan consumes on average. And beyond domestic AI needs, the US is locked into an existential struggle with China for AI supremacy. In short, America’s AI leadership will fall short if more nuclear energy isn’t developed.

President Trump can help accelerate his vision to “Energize America” by calling on the one company with the qualifications to immediately step up to the plate. Entra1 Energy is the exclusive commercialization partner of NuScale Power, the only technology provider and producer of small modular reactors (SMR) that has obtained U.S. nuclear regulatory approval and is ready for commercial deployment.

The advantages of the Entra1 Energy-NuScale alliance are fourfold. First, Entra1-NuScale has been certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), a process that can take at least 7 years.

In short, Nuscale is both deployable and can put power in the grid today. Second, NuScale can be deployed “behind the meter” and therefore, not pass on to consumers the higher costs of electricity needed to support America’s AI boom. This is important because at the current rate of total consumption, Americans can see a 70% increase in their electricity bills by 2030. Third, Entra1-NuScale can deploy its SMRs globally. As President Trump gets ready to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the U.A.E., he can also offer these countries, whose collective sovereign wealth exceeds $3 trillion, to consider companies such as Entra1-NuScale as their nuclear technology partner. And fourth, the Entra1-NuScale technology can help save lives. How? When a doctor is at an emergency room scanning the CT scans of millions of soldiers in hostile territory through 3D image recognition for wound assessment, he needs to ensure reliable and seamless access. Entra1-NuScale can provide this resilience and help save the lives of our brave men and women in uniform.

President Trump should take the following two steps to usher in a new era of American nuclear energy renewal. First, he should ask AI service providers such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Oracle to work with Nuscale to protect the American consumer but allow uninterrupted power to these leaders of America’s AI revolution. Second, Mr. Trump should instruct the Pentagon to sign with NuScale to provide reliable clean energy to bases inside and outside the US to stay ahead of China in the new race for AI dominance.

Specifically, the President can sign an Executive Order to direct the U.S. Air Force to start now (2025) to purchase power for 5 gigawatts from new SMR projects in the US to protect and grow the nation’s defense data centers and military drones/AI centers. For his Executive Order to be immediately actionable, he can state that the USAF utilize a Gen 3plus SMR technology that is: a) USNRC approved; b) uses readily available conventional fuel that is low-enriched; and c) SMRs deployable now with existing manufacturing facilities and supply chain capabilities. In practical terms, there is a direct connection between an Entra1-NuScale SMR and an MQ9 drone that is flying on enemy territory, taking millions of images for analysis by the US Air Force that cannot be interrupted because of lack of power or sabotage by Iranian, Russian or Chinese hackers.

By helping “Energize America” through nuclear energy, President Trump will ensure America’s long-term economic prosperity.

And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.
For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board.
Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories.
Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.","In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.

The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”

The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.

Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.

Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.

The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”

Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.

The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.

Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.

Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.

Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.
Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.
The Biden DOE had approved the $375 million Eastman funding in March 2024, using money from two laws passed in his presidency, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.
The pullback of Eastman funding comes less than two months after another large plastics recycling project that had received $182 million in Biden DOE funding, an International Recycling Group project in Erie, Pa., canceled its own plans.","President Donald Trump's administration canceled a $375 million federal investment on May 30 for an Eastman Chemical Co. chemical recycling facility planned for Longview, Texas.

The halt in federal funding for the $1.2 billion Eastman project was part of a larger Department of Energy announcement canceling DOE grants for 24 renewable energy and decarbonization projects worth a total of $3.7 billion.

The Trump administration said the projects, which were approved by President Joe Biden's government, were not economically viable and would not serve U.S. energy interests.

Eastman officials did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of federal support would affect the project, which would be the company's second chemical recycling facility for plastic waste.

On an April 25 earnings call, however, Eastman Chairman and CEO Mark Costa struck an optimistic tone, saying that “we're not getting an indication that the project is at risk.”

“We feel very good about where we are with the DOE,” he said. “They have been highly engaged with us. We think that we've got a good relationship there, and we think that our project actually holds up well in the way President Trump thinks about U.S. manufacturing.”

He said the Longview project fits U.S. security interests in onshoring manufacturing.

“It's also a national security way to make raw materials for food packaging, medical, et cetera,” Costa said. “It's onshoring jobs from Asia because most of all the PET business has now gone to China.”

The Longview plant would use a depolymerization technology to take plastic waste feedstock and produce virgin-quality materials for packaging and textiles.

When it was announced, Eastman said it would have capacity to process about 240 million pounds of plastic waste annually. The company's first molecular recycling plant is at its Kingsport, Tenn., headquarters.

A DOE news release did not name all 24 facilities and department officials did not respond to emails and a phone call for comment, but both the Longview News Journal and the online government-oriented news site NOTUS reported that Eastman's project was among those losing funding.

The Biden DOE had approved the $375 million Eastman funding in March 2024, using money from two laws passed in his presidency, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But in the Trump administration's May 30 announcement, the DOE said the projects would not ""advance the energy needs"" of the U.S., were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment on tax dollars.

""While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" DOE Secretary Chris Wright said. ""Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.""

The DOE said that federal funding for 16 of the 24 projects was approved between Trump's election day victory in November and when he took office on Jan. 20, and primarily included funding for carbon capture and storage, and decarbonization initiatives.

A Washington-based clean energy research organization, however, said the cuts in what's known as the Industrial Demonstrations Program would ultimately hurt U.S. competitiveness.

""The Industrial Demonstrations Program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration's goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,"" the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said. ""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness.""

Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to a memorandum he issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

American Cast Iron Pipe Company (metal manufacturing): $75 million

Brimstone Energy (low-carbon materials): $189 million

Calpine’s Baytown Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Calpine’s Sutter Energy Center (natural gas power plant): $270 million

Eastman Chemical Company’s Longview Plant (molecular plastic recycling): $375 million

Exxon Mobil’s Baytown Olefins Plant (chemical plant): $331.9 million

Skyven Technologies (heat pump steam generation): $15.3 million

Sublime Systems (low carbon cement): $86.9 million

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email.

“As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added.

The $125,000 grant would fund a framework for early site permitting for nuclear technology, which could be used by other municipal utilities.

The study will assess the suitability of Lakeland Electric's land for different types of nuclear power plants, but doesn't require the utility to build one.

For more than a decade, the idea of Lakeland Electric purchasing or producing nuclear power to provide electricity to customers has been talked about.

Now the city's taking a small step that could make that a reality in the future.

Lakeland commissioners will vote June 2 on whether to accept a $125,000 Demonstration of Energy and Efficiency Developments grant from the American Public Power Association. With the funding, Lakeland Electric would develop a framework for an early site permitting process that other municipal utilities could follow for nuclear technology.

""We want to make sure Lakeland Electric is flexible enough if nuclear technology grows up and if we get to a point where Lakeland choses to go nuclear, we are able to do so,"" said Mike Dammer, LE's manager of emerging technology. ""Why start the process in 15 years if we can do part of the work now?""

With the funds, Dammer said Lakeland Electric will receive the APPA's assistance from experienced nuclear professionals in evaluating the utility's land sites and conducting environmental studies to determine their suitability as future locations for different kinds of nuclear power plants and technology.

""Many of the APPA member utilities are in the same boat we're in: We have no nuclear knowledge, with no nuclear background but are interested in nuclear going forward,"" he said.

Building on research by the national nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, Deputy City Attorney Ramona Sirianni said the goal is to come up with a framework and set of procedures, or ""playbook,"" that municipal-owned utilities across the country can follow to get permits to build nuclear power plants.

The grant does not require Lakeland Electric to commit to building a nuclear power plant.

""We are not building a nuclear power plant as of right now,"" Dammer said. ""Getting an early site permit does not require you to build a [power] plant. It gives us the option to do so in the future.""

In 2020, Joel Ivy, Lakeland Electric's prior general manager, said he thought Lakeland Electric would make a major investment into nuclear energy if technology continued to advance over the next 10 to 15 years, with small modular nuclear reactors becoming more refined.

Commissioner Stephanie Madden has publicly spoken enthusiastically about the advancements in small modular nuclear reactors, sometimes called SMRs, as a future possibility.

""We could go into this study and find out that our site is just not suited for nuclear, that’s a very real possibility as well,"" Dammer said. ""We want to know what are our options.""

If city officials accept the grant, Lakeland Electric will have through April 1 to complete all necessary studies and work.

Even if Lakeland Electric's sites are found to not be well suited for nuclear, Dammer said the environmental studies performed can help the utility decide what might be the best use moving forward.

When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, it was heralded as the most ambitious climate and industrial policy in decades. While its headline focused on clean energy and emissions reduction, the law is also proving to be a massive economic catalyst for historically overlooked regions, especially in Appalachia. From battery manufacturing in Pennsylvania to steel upgrades in Ohio and hydroelectric projects in Kentucky, federal investments are flowing into working-class communities that had long been dismissed as left behind. This is not just climate policy, it’s economic reinvestment, job creation, and community revitalization. Need more insight?

The GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions and energy use in technologies) model was first developed by Argonne National Laboratory in 1994. The tool is designed to access the life cycle impacts of technologies, fuels, products and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. The agency has since developed multiple GREET models designed for specific use cases.

The DOE in January 2025 released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is specifically designed to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

The agency has now updated the 45ZCF-GREET model, noting the changes “will allow a wider range of farmers and companies to do business in America’s thriving alternative fuels market.”

Information released by the DOE outlines eight specific changes the agency has made to 45ZCF-GREET. The changes include:

Added pathway for ethanol from U.S. corn wet mills. A simplified plant-level allocation by mass is applied to derive the results for ethanol. The same indirect emissions value per MJ for dry mill corn ethanol is applied to wet mill ethanol.

Revised Methanol input for biodiesel production to be entered in gallons as opposed to units of energy (MMBtu).

Added coal as a process input option for biodiesel via Transesterification pathways.

Clarifies in the GREET User Manual that Carbon capture utilization and sequestration (CCUS) allows CO₂ stored in U.S. Class II wells used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in addition to Class VI wells. (Note: No changes to model only revisions to user manual.)

Corrected Summary Table 9b. in the GREET User Manual to reflect final Indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions factors for soy and canola. (Note: No changes to model or modeled results, only correcting summary data as presented in the manual.)

Added pathway for alternative natural gas from coal mine methane (CMM) capture and upgrading.

Lifecycle emissions results updated to include the output in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent per million British thermal units (kg CO₂e/MMBtu), consistent with Section 45Z tax credit.

Added text to the GREET User Manual to quote Notice 2025-11, sec. 401 to clarify that these (and potential future) model updates, including new types, categories or pathways, may be used immediately.

“The Trump administration is committed to helping American fuel producers make the most of our country’s abundant biomass resources,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Lou Hrkman. “The latest version of the 45ZCF-GREET model will allow more of our farmers to reap the benefits of a rapidly expanding market for alternative transportation fuels.”

Growth Energy is welcoming the new guidance, noting it will create jobs and unleash new investments. “By lifting needless restrictions on wet mills and different end uses for captured carbon, the updated user manual ensures that more farmers and biofuel producers will have the freedom and flexibility to invest in U.S. energy dominance while supporting stronger markets for American agriculture,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “In conjunction with an extension of the credit under consideration by lawmakers, this guidance will help restore market certainty and increase American competitiveness in the race for the next generation of liquid fuel solutions. We applaud Energy Secretary Wright for working with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to deliver a fairer, more accurate model for calculating incentives that will help drive American energy dominance and spur economic growth.”

“Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a great stimulus for new clean energy projects, EV factories, battery factories, etc. It led to massive new investments, reshoring of countless blue collar jobs, and a more vibrant economy for the fast-growing industries of the future.

More broadly, as we reported last November, Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda was linked to $988 billion in private sector investments.

However, Donald Trump does not want the country or the world transitioning from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy and electric vehicles, and policy changes Republicans are moving through Congress put that preference onto paper, with disastrous results.

According to a new analysis from the nonpartisan organization E2, so far this year, businesses have “cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in clean energy and clean vehicle factories” due to concerns about policy changes and especially removal of key tax credits. So much for being businesses friendly and supporting manufacturing in the United States.

Just in April, as talk of repealing clean energy policies heated up (not to mention the tariffs), $4.5 billion in investments in EV, wind power, and battery projects were cancelled. E2 notes that this is “in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits.”

In other words, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is going to cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of private sector investment in the US.

Ironically, it’s Republican-controlled districts that are being the most hurt by this. “Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.” Yet again, we have a case of Republican politicians doing things that hurt Republican voters — but all the politicians have to do is keep them scared and enraged about things that don’t really harm them and the rest is ignored or forgiven.

“Through April, over 61 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments—are in congressional districts represented by Republicans,” E2 adds.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake commented.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

One can dream, but “counting on Congress to come to its senses” doesn’t seem advisable.

The good news is that so many projects were stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act and other Investing in America policies that some of them will continue on anyway. Also, frankly, these are growing industries and that’s going to continue to be the case for years to come. “While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy,” E2 writes. “Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states – including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Solar-Power-Battery-Energy-Storage-CleanTechnica-Watermark.png,N,,2025-05-30 17:07:39.670560
,EVs,2025-05-30 20:08:53+00:00,WWMT,Proposed tax cuts could impact Ford's investment in Marshall's BlueOval Battery Park,"Autumn Pitchure | News Channel 3, Autumn Pitchure, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://wwmt.com/news/local/ford-blueoval-battery-park-marshall-michigan-big-beautiful-bill-proposed-tax-cuts-impact-investment-politics-government-donald-trump-state,"A new bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could impact Ford Motor Company's investment in their multi-billion dollar BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall.
""The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,"" Ford Motor Company Executive Chair Bill Ford said.
This comes amid other challenges the company has faced since building the battery park.
Once complete, BlueOval Battery Park is expected to create 1,700 local jobs when production of batteries for electric vehicles begins in 2026.
As of Friday, BlueOval Battery Park is approximately 60% complete, according to a Ford spokesperson who said they will be bringing equipment into the facility beginning this summer.","A new bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives this month could impact Ford Motor Company's investment in their multi-billion dollar BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" could bar tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology, impacting Ford's incoming Marshall plant that would be making battery cells using technology from Chinese battery giant CATL.

""The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,"" Ford Motor Company Executive Chair Bill Ford said.

BlueOval:

At a conference on Mackinac Island Thursday, Ford said the disappearance of tax credits for EV batteries will threaten their investment in the Marshall plant.

""We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place, it's not fair to change policies after all the expenditures have been made,"" Ford said. ""If it really doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall.""

This comes amid other challenges the company has faced since building the battery park.

In 2024, Ford cut funding for the project. The state then scaled back their own investment from $210 million to $141 million, blaming a ""turbulent EV market.""

Once complete, BlueOval Battery Park is expected to create 1,700 local jobs when production of batteries for electric vehicles begins in 2026.

Ford believes the federal funding cuts put these jobs in jeopardy.

""We actually don't think it's fair to have offered all those jobs, about to open [the park] and then say, 'sorry, we're changing the policy,'"" Ford said. ""So I'm spending a lot of time, you know, talking about that with politicians.""

Progress:

""It just seems wrong to take it away,"" Michael Lounds, owner of TrailBlazers, added. ""At this point, it needs to happen, the structure is there and everything, It's not going to just disappear tomorrow. If it did, it would just be an eye sore for the community.""

Lounds is one of over 100 local entities who have in support of keeping the tax credits and continuing the investment in the plant.

""Marshall is a great community, and this would be something that would really help solidify us moving forward,"" Lounds said.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress"" has to be passed by the U.S. Senate before heading to President Trump's desk.

,Kentucky American Energy ,2025-05-30 19:47:00+00:00,Canary Media,Trump admin cuts $3.7B for industrial decarbonization and carbon capture - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced,"But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.
The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world.
That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods.
Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana.
The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.","The Department of Energy announced Friday that it is canceling over $3.7 billion in funding for projects that would cut carbon emissions and toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial sites, ranging from cement kilns to ketchup-processing plants.

The DOE shared a list of the projects to be cut with Canary Media on Friday, which showed that more than half of the awards under the ambitious Industrial Demonstrations Program, housed under the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, will be terminated. OCED funding focused on carbon capture at gas-fired power plants is also impacted.

DOE claimed the projects ​“failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But advocates disagree. Not only would the projects kickstart efforts to clean up industries that are notoriously tricky to decarbonize — they would have generated serious economic benefits, too.

Analyses from groups including the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy have found that federal spending from OCED would have created hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and helped position U.S. industries to compete in international markets that are increasingly demanding cleaner materials and products.

Stakeholders have for months expected the Trump administration to cut the OCED awards, which were authorized under the Biden administration by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In March and April, reports surfaced of plans by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate the office’s $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program, cut carbon capture and sequestration projects, and cancel billions of dollars of funding for clean-hydrogen hubs based in Democratic-leaning states.

Today’s announcement doesn’t include any hydrogen-hub funding cuts. But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.

The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to decarbonize the production of cement, one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world. That includes $189 million for Brimstone and $87 million for Sublime Systems, two startups pioneering new low-carbon cement production methods. Global cement giant Heidelberg Materials will lose its $500 million award to capture carbon emissions at a massive existing cement plant in Indiana. And the National Cement Company of California won’t receive its $500 million grant to take a multi-technology approach to cutting emissions from its plant in Lebec, California.

The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage systems.

Kraft Heinz will lose its $170 million award to install clean heat technologies at 10 of its food production facilities. Beverage giant Diageo North America will no longer receive the $75 million it was promised to help install thermal energy storage systems from startup Rondo Energy at production facilities in Kentucky and Illinois. And Texas-based industrial heat pump manufacturer Skyven Technologies, which had been awarded a $145 million grant to install its technology at a New York state ethanol plant, was listed on DOE’s spreadsheet as having a $15 million grant rescinded. (DOE did not immediately respond to inquiries to determine whether Skyven was set to lose only part of its $145 million grant or if DOE’s spreadsheet was in error.)

Projects to cut pollution from factories that make metals are also on the chopping block. That includes a $75 million grant to back American Cast Iron Pipe Co.’s ​“Next Gen Melt Project,” which would have lowered emissions from iron and steelmaking at its site in Birmingham, Alabama. It also includes $75 million for United States Pipe and Foundry Co. to replace a coal-fired furnace with electric arc furnaces.

The DOE’s cancellations will also impact several projects seeking to reduce carbon emissions from glass production, including $75 million for Gallo Glass in Modesto, California; $57 million for Owens-Brockway Glass Container in Zanesville, Ohio; and $45 million for Libbey Glass in Toledo, Ohio.

Friday’s list also includes projects to cut carbon emissions from chemicals production, including $100 million for Ørsted to capture and use industrial carbon dioxide waste to make shipping fuel at its Star e-Methanol facility in Texas; $375 million for Eastman Chemical Co.’s plastics recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $331 million for Exxon Mobil to use hydrogen instead of fossil gas for ethylene production in Baytown, Texas.

Funding for carbon capture and storage projects at power plants will be scrapped, too. Calpine will not receive a pair of $270 million awards to retrofit power plants in Texas and California.

The list did not include some high-profile metals decarbonization projects, like the $575 million in grants set to flow to two Cleveland-Cliffs steel facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio — the latter in Middletown, Vice President JD Vance’s hometown — or the $500 million for Century Aluminum to build a ​“green smelter,” likely in Kentucky.

What remains unclear is the extent to which Friday’s cancellations have disrupted ongoing construction, hiring of workers, or other unrecoverable commitments from companies impacted. Firms have been tight-lipped about plans to navigate the consequences of federal funding clawbacks. All of the awards required participating companies to invest at least as much as they were set to receive in federal grants.

A representative of Sublime Systems told Canary Media that the company was ​“surprised and disappointed” by DOE’s decision to cut its grant. Sublime this week announced a deal with Microsoft, which said it would buy 600,000 tons of the low-carbon cement to be produced from the startup’s first commercial-scale plant in Holyoke, Massachusetts — a plant backed by DOE’s grant.

“It is our hope to continue to partner with the DOE to show a success story of American innovation and ingenuity at its finest,” Sublime’s representative said in a Friday email. ​“Nevertheless, we have prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome and are evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

The projects are without a doubt now on far shakier financial footing, and advocates do not expect that they’ll be able to move forward without the federal funding. Should they fail, the effects would be profound, according to Evan Gillespie, a partner at advocacy group Industrious Labs.

“[The projects] would have helped catapult the U.S. into a leadership position in the technologies that will bring down emissions and pace the next generation of industrial evolution,” he said. ​“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas industry executive who insists that climate change is not a crisis, said in Friday’s announcement that the decision would benefit U.S. taxpayers.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Industrial decarbonization advocates pushed back.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a Friday statement. ​“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret. Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213269576.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fe009fbf92252e9a29b1f3e443e57600,N,,2025-05-30 18:09:17.036675

There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.
In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits: Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits Current Law.
The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets.
Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.","On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Act). The Act includes an accelerated repeal schedule of significant renewable energy tax credits and more restrictive amendments than those initially introduced in the House Ways and Means Committee’s proposed bill (Bill), which was approved by the Ways and Means Committee on May 14, 2025.

As described more fully below, among the changes proposed to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA)1, the Act includes the following:

repeal of the technology-neutral tax credits (i.e., Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y PTC) and Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit (48E ITC)) for projects (i) on which construction begins more than 60 days following the date of the Act’s enactment or (ii) that are placed in service after 2028 (without regard to when construction begins)

acceleration, or provision for, the phaseout of most other energy credits

repeal of the credit transferability provision starting (i) two years after enactment of the Act, for the 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, or (ii) in 2028, for the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit and the Section 45Z tax credits Clean Fuel Production Credit

introduction of restrictions and limitations for claiming energy credits by adding foreign entity of concern (FEOC) related provisions starting in 2026

Key Takeaways

If enacted, the Act will significantly affect the renewable energy industry and adversely affect the ability to develop and finance various renewable energy projects.

The new FEOC-related restrictions may cause taxpayers and projects that would otherwise be eligible for such tax credits to lose their eligibility due to ownership and supply-chain issues. Accordingly, the inclusion of the FEOC-related provisions and their broad application will need to be carefully analyzed and discussed in connection with existing and future commercial arrangements.

The Act generally does not affect energy projects that began construction by the end of 2024 and are eligible for tax credits pursuant to Section 48 (Section 48 ITC) and Section 45 (Section 45 PTC). The Act also does not directly change the domestic content or energy community adders, although those adders would be subject to accelerated phaseout (or repeal) in the same manner as the base credits. There are no direct changes to the direct-pay option, which effectively makes applicable tax credits “refundable” tax credits.

The Act now moves to the Senate for continuing debates and negotiations. Numerous Senate Republicans stated that they will have additional changes to the Act and voiced objections to the accelerated phaseout of certain energy credits.

Changes to Existing Energy Credit Provisions

Section 48E / Section 45Y — Zero Emission / Clean Electricity ITCs and PTCs

Current Law. For projects beginning construction after 2024, the IRA replaced the Section 45 PTC and Section 48 ITC with corresponding “technology neutral” credits: the Section 45Y PTC and the Section 48E ITC. Each of these credits is currently subject to a phaseout starting in 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions).

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45Y PTC and Section 48E ITC for any qualified facility that (i) begins construction more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Act or (ii) that is placed in service after December 31, 2028. Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2029, remain eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC. This differs from the proposal in the Bill that provided an accelerated phaseout of the credits tied to the year in which the project is placed in service (rather than the year in which construction begins).

Key Takeaways. The proposed elimination of the phaseout schedule and the repeal of these credits for projects that either did not begin construction by the end of the 60-day period following the enactment of the Act or will not be placed in service before 2029 is significant and will adversely affect wind, solar, battery storage, and other renewable energy projects.

Under current law, the full credit amount would be available for projects that begin construction prior to 2034 (or later, depending on changes in greenhouse gas emissions). Under existing Internal Revenue Service “beginning-of-construction” guidance, a project satisfying the “physical work test” or “5% safe harbor” in a particular year will be treated as beginning construction in that year so long as it is placed in service during the four years following that year. Accordingly, under current law, projects beginning construction in 2033 would be eligible for the full credit amount so long as they are placed in service before 2038.

If the Act is enacted in its current form, taxpayers that have not yet begun construction on projects intended to qualify for the Section 45Y PTC or the Section 48E ITC will need to evaluate their current construction schedules and consider strategies for satisfying the beginning of construction requirement during the 60-day period following the Act’s enactment. In this regard, while it seems reasonable to assume that the same beginning-of-construction rules that have historically applied in the context of renewable energy projects (i.e., the “physical work test” and the “5% safe harbor”) will apply for these purposes, this is a point that may require confirmation from the Department of the Treasury.

Section 45Q — Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Current Law. Section 45Q entitles taxpayers who (i) own carbon capture equipment used to capture qualified carbon oxide from an industrial facility or from the atmosphere and (ii) physically or contractually sequester or use it for certain purposes as provided by Section 45Q to a credit for each metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured and sequestered or used during the 12-year period starting on the date the equipment is first placed in service. Taxpayers may claim the Section 45Q credit if construction on a qualified facility begins before January 1, 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act does not accelerate the expiration of the Section 45Q credit, nor does the Act introduce a phaseout concept applicable to the credit. However, the proposal to repeal the transferability of the tax credits, pursuant to Section 6418, and the new foreign entity of concern provisions (both explained in greater detail in separate sections below) apply to the credit.

Section 45U — Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45U, which provides a two-tier credit, adjusted for inflation, per kWh of electricity produced at a qualified nuclear facility and sold to an unrelated party after 2023 and before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for the Section 45U Zero Emission Nuclear Power PTC based on the year in which the project is placed in service, as follows:

Section 45V — Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45V, which provides a two-tier, inflation-adjusted, 10-year PTC for clean hydrogen produced after 2022 at a qualified facility, the construction of which begins before 2033.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit effective for projects on which construction commences after December 31, 2025, which is seven years earlier than the sunset date under the IRA.

Section 45X — Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45X, which provides tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party. The Section 45X credit amount varies depending on the eligible component. The Section 45X credit begins phasing out in 2030 and is not available for components sold after 2032.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to terminate the Section 45X credits for wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The Act further proposes an accelerated phaseout schedule for all other eligible components, as follows:

Section 45Z — Clean Fuel Production Credit

Current Law. The IRA added Section 45Z, which provides a clean fuel production tax credit for taxpayers who produce and sell qualifying transportation fuel to an unrelated party before January 1, 2028, with the credit amount determined, in part, by reference to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions rate. Among other requirements, the fuel must be produced in the United States for the taxpayer to be eligible for the Section 45Z credit.

Proposed Changes. In contrast to most of the other energy credits, the Act proposes to extend the period this credit can be claimed by four years, until December 31, 2031, but proposes changes to the eligibility requirements and calculation of the credit.

The Act proposes to limit the availability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel sold after December 31, 2025, to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada rather than solely requiring that the fuel be produced in the United States.

The Act also makes two changes to how the emissions rate used in determining the credit amount is calculated. First, the Act provides that the amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use change. Second, with respect to any transportation fuel derived from animal manure, a distinct emissions rate shall be provided with respect to each of the specific feedstocks used to such produce such fuel (i.e., dairy manure, swine manure, poultry manure, and such other sources determined by the Secretary of the Treasury).

Termination of Other Energy Credits

Proposed Changes. In addition to the proposed changes to the energy credits addressed above, the Act proposes to terminate the following energy credits:

Section 6418 — Third Party Sales of Eligible Credits

Current Law. The IRA added Section 6418 to the Code, which allows eligible taxpayers to transfer all or a portion of their eligible credits for cash, to a taxpayer that is not related to the transferor taxpayer (within the meaning of Section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)). The third-party sale provisions provide an alternative for renewable energy developers to monetize their tax credits without accessing the tax equity markets. Section 6418 and the related Treasury Regulations provided various requirements that must be satisfied in order for eligible credits to be sold and eligible credits may not be transferred more than once.

Proposed Changes. The Act proposes to repeal the transferability provisions with respect to various credits. The chart below lists the affected credits and the effective date of the repeal of their transferability.

Key Takeaways. The proposed repeal of the transferability of the various tax credits is likely to have a material impact on the development and financing of various projects. This alternative method of monetizing the various tax credits had a positive impact on the market since the enactment of the IRA and assisted developers with financing their projects. During taxable year 2024, it is estimated that tax credits in excess of $25 billion were sold pursuant to these rules. Repealing this monetization alternative will require developers and sponsors to rely mainly on the tax equity financing, which was a market historically capped at approximately $20 billion. This may adversely affect the number of projects developed.

There are no changes to the transferability rules for projects eligible for the Section 45Y PTC or Section 48E ITC (contrary to the suggested repeal of these transferability rules as initially proposed in the Bill). However, this should not provide significant comfort to developers of wind, solar, battery storage, and other technologies generally eligible for such tax credits due to the general accelerated repeal of these credits, as discussed above.

Newly Proposed Energy Credit Provisions/Restrictions

In addition to the repeals and accelerated phaseout schedules for existing energy credit provisions, the Act introduces complex restrictions relating to certain relationships with “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs). These restrictions broaden the category of restricted foreign entities from the Department of Energy’s interpretation of FEOC to the more expansive category of PFEs.

These rules apply to most energy credits, including (as applicable) the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, Section 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power PTC, and Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing PTC.

In general, these restrictions are divided into two sets of restrictions. The first set includes restrictions related to projects owned by a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs. The second set includes restrictions related to projects in which SFEs or entities controlled or influenced by SFEs provide material assistance in connection with the design, construction, or operation of the project.

Ownership-Related Restrictions

Starting in 2026, no tax credit is allowed if a project is owned by an SFE. An SFE is generally an entity that is either (i) identified by reference to an enumerated list of authorities as a threat to the security of the United States or (ii) a “foreign-controlled entity.” A domestic entity will be an SFE only if it is a “foreign-controlled entity,” which generally requires more than 50% ownership by entities with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran.4

The ownership rules become more restrictive starting two years after enactment of the Act. At that time, no credit will be allowed if the entity that owns the project is a “foreign-controlled entity” or is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

The definition of a “foreign-influenced entity” is much broader than the definition of a foreign-controlled entity. An entity will be treated as a “foreign-influenced entity” during a taxable year if

- an SFE (including foreign-controlled entities and entities otherwise identified as SFEs) has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or person with similar powers

- a single SFE has an ownership interest of 10% or more

- multiple SFEs hold, in the aggregate, ownership interests of 25% or more

- one or more SFEs hold 25% or more of the entity’s outstanding debt

- payments of certain fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic payments (e.g., dividends, interests, royalites, rents, service fees) (FDAP Payments) knowingly made to a single SFE exceed 10% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

- FDAP payments knowingly made to one or more SFEs exceed 25% of the amount of such payments for the prior taxable year

Project/Facility-Level Restrictions

In addition to the ownership restrictions, a project will not be eligible for the Section 45Y PTC, Section 48E ITC, or Section 45X credit if the construction of the project (or production of components in the case of Section 45X) begins following December 31, 2025 (or two years in the case of the Section 45X credit), and such construction (or production of components) includes “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., an SFE or foreign-influenced entity).

The term “material assistance” means, with respect to any property,

(i) any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X(c)(6)) included in such property that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity

(ii) any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity

“Material assistance” does not include any assembly part, subcomponent, or constituent material provided that such part or material is not (i) exclusively or predominantly produced by PFE, (ii) acquired directly from a PFE, and (iii) uniquely designed for use in construction of a Section 48E ITC or Section 45Y PTC facility or a Section 45X eligible component.5

In addition to the foregoing, for any taxable year beginning after the date that is two years following the date of enactment of the Act, the existence of FDAP Payments made to one or more PFEs during that taxable year would also lead to the ineligibility for such tax credits, if such payments are made

- to a single PFE in an amount equal to or greater than 5% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year or

- to multiple PFEs in an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the total of such payments made during that taxable year.

In the case of Section 48E ITC, the violation of these FDAP Payments rules during the 10-year period following the date the applicable project was placed in service will trigger a 100% recapture of the Section 48E ITC previously claimed.

Section 45X Related Restrictions

In addition to the general ownership and components related restrictions above, there are certain other operational restrictions that could prevent manufacturers from claiming the Section 45X tax credits.

Starting two years after the enactment of the Act, no Section 45X credits will be allowed if the production of certain applicable components is made with “material assistance” from a PFE. In addition to the definition above, “material assistance” for purposes of Section 45X will also be found if

- any design of the component is based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE, or any knowhow or trade secret provided by a PFE, or

- such component is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE with value exceeding $1 million.

Key Takeaways

The imposition of the new FEOC-related restrictions and the broad definitions of the related terms introduce significant complexity to the planning and analysis related to the eligibility of projects for the applicable tax credits. This together with the relatively short transition period included in the Act will require market participants to quickly reevaluate and potentially restructure their ownership and relevant supply chain and related commercial arrangements to mitigate the related risks if the Act will be enacted without changes.

The Act will now be reviewed and negotiated in the Senate, and further revisions to some of these rules are likely. We will continue to monitor this process and provide updates.

Timothy Male is the executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Policy Innovation Center.","In the clash between the competing pro-petroleum and pro-climate visions of the economy, few policy issues are as misunderstood and complicated as our nation’s environmental permitting systems.

The number of permitting actions is enormous.

During a single presidential term, approximately 1.5 million permitting, informal review, and consultation processes are overseen under just five environmental and historic preservation laws. Many of these cover minor actions that would never have required permits in the 1970s and 1980s.

Consider the National Environmental Policy Act. Roughly 400,000 “categorical exclusions” are processed under this law each presidential term, compared to about 1,000 major reviews called “environmental impact statements.” An exclusion isn’t an absence of review; instead, it is akin to a simpler kind of permit. There are categorical exclusions to cover summer picnics by federal agencies, a 90- to 120-day exclusion process for a loan to replace powerlines across North Dakota wheat fields, or exclusions for every Agriculture Department grant to a farmer. Most exclusions involve minimal staff hours and are completed in weeks to months, making it hard to object to any one review. But collectively, their issuance requires hundreds of staff and millions of days of project delays.

Over four years, about a million similar, small permit processes will run their course under the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and especially the National Historic Preservation Act.

Yet almost all the attention on reform has focused on the small number of “big” permits.

For example, President Biden’s permitting team reported cutting 25 percent off the average processing time for those 1,000 major environmental impact statements, compared to the first Trump administration, whose permits were also faster than the administration of Obama.

On big permits, Democratic administrations have favored adding staff to write and review documents. That strategy works, but it can be hard to maintain, particularly if agency budgets get cut. And most of the laborious steps to finish an impact statement remained unchanged, with some becoming more expansive.

Republicans tend to favor the wholesale elimination of major permits — at least for fossil fuel infrastructure — and cutting staff. That pattern showed up across President Trump’s executive orders. If maintained by courts and Congress, those orders would eliminate some National Environmental Policy Act regulations and skip most requirements to protect clean water and endangered wildlife by calling permit issuance an emergency. Democrats are increasingly flirting with exemptions for different categories of projects — wind and solar instead of oil and gas, for example.

A problem with taking away major permits is that they often have very significant impacts on things that communities in both red and blue states value. Permit reviews can produce much less harmful outcomes.

Addressing the millions of smaller permits is a missed opportunity with fewer downsides.

First, we should entirely eliminate thousands of small permits by defining the actions they cover as not “major federal actions” — the original, intended scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. For instance, a provision in proposed permitting legislation redefines all grants and loans this way. This change would benefit thousands of towns, cities, nonprofits and businesses that receive federal funding and wouldn’t affect public input because few categorical exclusions ever involve the public in the first place.

Second, we can improve remaining small permit processes by expanding reforms that have proven successful in dramatically accelerating timelines and reducing workload while still avoiding or compensating for harms caused by projects.

For example, government agencies are increasingly using technology-based ‘dashboards’ that allow anyone to track the status of an application and exactly which staff are reviewing it. Virginia has achieved the greatest success with this technology, alongside procedural reforms, delivering an expected 70 percent reduction in application review times for 200,000 state decisions over four years. The Department of Energy is piloting AI technologies that could allow more than 80 percent of small permit documents to be machine written.

Self-permitting under general permits is another promising reform. Projects that agree to use what are effectively common-sense best practices to avoid harm are automatically approved if they submit the paperwork that proves those practices will be followed. General permits exist under clean water and wildlife laws, although the paperwork required to get these automatic approvals could still be significantly reduced.

Offsets — which are opportunities to compensate for unavoidable environmental impacts — also help. Having a supply of pre-approved beneficial offsets has sped up some Clean Water Act permitting by 50 percent. We can’t build everything Americans want without having any environmental effect, and having offsets available allows unavoidable harm to be balanced with benefits to similar environmental features nearby.

The most important change needed to improve or eliminate millions of small procedures is a culture shift among both permitting agencies and permit applicants. Many government staff are dedicated public servants, but some view institutional caution as a mission and environmental permitting as a battleground instead of an opportunity to problem-solve with constituents.

On the other side, many applicants blame agencies when they themselves have submitted flawed or incomplete applications, proposed unreasonable projects, or rejected the idea of regulatory oversight, failing to respect the reality that most Americans want to unlock growth while also stewarding the environment.

Making a million small processes more agile, responsive and effective is a key step toward a government that strikes these balances, and that serves the needs of all Americans.

Designed for narrow streets, the one-seater EV has garnered significant pre-orders, potentially surpassing Toyota's EV sales in Japan. Priced at ¥1 million, the mibot targets rural areas and aims to address skepticism towards EVs with its minimalist design and low production costs.

A Japanese startup, KG Motors, is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV called the mibot, according to Bloomberg. Resembling a futuristic golf cart, the mibot is designed for Japan's narrow streets and has already pre-sold over half of the 3,300 units planned for delivery in 2027. This puts KG Motors on track to surpass Toyota, which sold around 2,000 EVs in Japan in 2024. This reportedly puts KG Motors on track to sell more EVs in Japan than the world’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., which shifted around such 2,000 vehicles in all of 2024. In a country where EVs are still a rare sight, KG Motors is trying to bust a burgeoning myth: That Bigger is Better. “Cars are simply too big,” said Kazunari Kusunoki, KG Motors’ founder and CEO, as quoted by Bloomberg. The mibot, priced at ¥1 million ($7,000) before tax, is half the cost of Japan’s popular Nissan Sakura EV. It offers a 100-kilometer range, a five-hour charge time, and a top speed of 60 km/h. Production is set to begin in October at a new factory east of Hiroshima. Japan’s EV market lags globally, with EVs making up just 3.5% of vehicle sales in 2023 compared to the global average of 18%, per BloombergNEF. Toyota’s multi-pathway approach, favoring hybrids alongside EVs, has shaped public skepticism about EVs’ popularity, Kusunoki noted. However, small kei cars like the Sakura, which sold nearly 23,000 units in 2024, dominate Japan’s EV market. KG Motors’ mibot, with its minimalist design and low production costs, targets rural areas with declining public transport. Bloomberg reports that 95% of the 2,250 pre-orders come from homeowners with at least one vehicle. The startup expects to break even on its second batch of 3,000 units and aims to produce 10,000 annually thereafter.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas.
With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.
“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”","The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday canceled more than $1 billion in clean energy funding for Texas as part of a continuing effort to reduce federal spending.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Among the canceled awards is a $331.9 million grant to ExxonMobil to replace natural gas with hydrogen at its Baytown Olefins Plant — a move that was expected to cut the facility’s emissions by more than half. Also canceled were a $270 million grant to Calpine for a carbon-capture facility in Baytown, a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical for a molecular recycling project in Longview, and a $99 million grant to Orsted for a clean methanol initiative along the Gulf Coast.

A spokesperson for ExxonMobil declined to comment on Friday. Calpine, Eastman Chemical and Orsted didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas. With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.

According to Energy Secretary Wright, the decision is expected to generate “an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.” Critics, however, argue the cancellations threaten the country’s energy innovation and manufacturing future.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3d6b80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5551x2914+0+393/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F3c%2Feba0b2c84e2ba148f5a296dddc24%2Fpower-plant-weatherization-tour-51629999110-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 16:09:38.611765

No domestic carbon fee was included in this analysis, and the report assumes that domestic manufacturing would fill the product void from lost imports.","Key takeaways:

Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions back to the source of pollution.

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs) generally work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported material compared to the same material produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The Clean Competition Act (3422/H.R.6622) from the 118th Congress and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325), which was reintroduced in April 2025, both aim to set a price on carbon-intensive imported products.

The shift to domestic production, which would likely be spurred by a CBAM-like policy, could create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually, according to Third Way.

Greenhouse gas emissions come with a real and substantial price tag, whether from rising sea levels, increased healthcare costs in heavily industrialized communities, or crop damage. Carbon pricing shifts the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions from society back to the source of pollution. With a carbon price, often set per ton of carbon dioxide emitted, the cost of emissions partially rests on the original emitters. There are a variety of methods for pricing emissions, including carbon taxes, cap and trade, and regulations and standards.

Nations that implement carbon pricing within their borders can consider pairing that with a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which levels the playing field by ensuring that both domestic and foreign manufacturers pay the cost of their pollution. Implementing a CBAM without a domestic carbon pricing policy would likely be considered protectionism by trading partners, and could invite retaliation.

Inversely, policy analysts emphasize that environmental degradation is an unfair trade practice. Regulations generally increase the cost of production, so countries with lower industry standards can make cheaper products, but usually with a higher overall emissions intensity. The status quo system perpetuates U.S. companies importing inexpensive and carbon-intensive materials.

The European Union and the United Kingdom, which both have domestic carbon pricing policies in place, have both recently announced CBAM initiatives to tax imported carbon-intensive products and account for the direct and indirect emissions associated with their manufacturing. These CBAM policies work by looking at the carbon intensity of an imported product compared to the same product produced domestically. If producing the imported product released more carbon emissions than the production of its domestic counterpart, the entity importing the good is taxed the difference.

The emissions intensity of a product accounts for the material inputs, off-site electricity and heat, and final product manufacturing emissions (like raw material extraction or transportation). In 2021, stainless steel produced in Indonesia emitted 4.25 times the amount of greenhouse gases of steel produced in the United States, and the steel industry in China had double the emissions intensity of the U.S. steel industry.

CBAM market-based climate policies also aim to limit carbon leakage, or the transfer of production-related emissions to another country to avoid regulation or fees. For example, if a country in Europe should decide to import all of its steel because it is carbon intensive to produce, it would no longer be held accountable for any steel-related carbon emissions. Its domestic emissions would fall, making it easier to meet carbon reduction goals, but overall emissions would likely rise, which would defeat the goals’ purpose. With a CBAM, if the country is importing carbon-intensive steel, there will be a cost associated with that, putting more responsibility on the consuming country. In this way, a CBAM ideally incentivizes trade partners to reduce their production-related emissions.

There are numerous ways to implement a CBAM-like program. Each goes by a different name—CBAM, Methane Border Adjustment Mechanism (Methane BAM), Border Pollution Mechanism, and Foreign Pollution Fee—and involves different fine print, players, and intensity.

In recent years, proposed policies in the United States have attempted to launch carbon pricing mechanisms similar to those across the pond. In the 118th Congress, the Clean Competition Act (S.3422/H.R.6622) and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.3198) both aimed to set a price on carbon-intensive products, but with starkly different approaches. Neither bill made it past introduction last Congress, but the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (S.1325) was reintroduced by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in the 119th Congress in April 2025.

The revenue from the Clean Competition Act’s CBAM, championed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), would be directed towards decarbonization, while the Foreign Pollution Fee Act does not specify where the revenue would be sent. The latter focuses more on boosting domestic manufacturing and national security under the Made in America policy agenda, with emissions reductions as a secondary benefit. Furthermore, the foreign pollution fee would only tax imported goods, while the Clean Competition Act would tax both imported and domestic products relative to their carbon emissions. Although emission reductions are likely to be more significant if domestic manufacturers also have a financial incentive to reduce product emissions intensity, a domestic carbon tax is a harder sell politically.

Sens. Whitehouse and Cassidy often speak about their ideas for CBAM-like programs. In February 2025, the Silverado Policy Accelerator hosted a fireside chat with the two lawmakers to examine the impact of carbon pricing on the United States and its trade partners. Silverado presented new research about the potential environmental and economic benefits of a CBAM for the trade of aluminum and steel, which are both carbon intensive to produce. Steel and aluminum are the first products to be affected by the European Union CBAM.

The Silverado study applied two fee-setting approaches: per ton and relative difference. The per ton fee looks at the difference between imported emissions-intensive goods and goods produced domestically, then applies a dollar amount per additional metric ton of carbon emitted by the foreign manufacturer. The relative difference fee is based on the assessed value of the item and set at a rate of either 0.6% or 0.9% for every 1% more emissions intensive the import is than the domestic product.

Using wrought aluminum as an example, if the tax is $55 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (the starting fee of the Clean Competition Act), then there would be an estimated 18% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources (e.g., China, South Korea, India, South Africa, Turkey, and Mexico) and a 2% increase in imports to the United States from less carbon-intensive sources (Canada and the European Union). However, a relative difference tax of 0.9% (the highest proposed rate of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act) under the same circumstances would lead to an 82% decrease in imports to the United States from more carbon-intensive sources and a 9% increase in imports to the United States from less-carbon intensive sources. No domestic carbon fee was included in this analysis, and the report assumes that domestic manufacturing would fill the product void from lost imports.

A CBAM program would create an economic opportunity for U.S. producers. The steel industry could see an $8.5 billion increase in domestic markets, with aluminum closely following at $6 billion in newly claimed production by 2030. Additionally, the shift to domestic production would likely create an estimated 30,000 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries annually.

Under a CBAM, the shift of manufacturing back to the United States could encourage energy efficiency in the industrial sector, since the fewer emissions the sector generates, the harder it would be for foreign companies to compete and reduce their CBAM fees. At EESI’s Clean Manufacturing in America briefing, panelist Nora Wang Esram, now the CEO at New Buildings Institute, explained how the industrial sector’s energy usage has doubled in the past 70 years, and an estimated 50% of the energy consumed in industrial applications is lost through waste heat. Certain industries are considering electrification, industrial heat pumps, and thermal heat batteries to increase efficiency. Esram noted that complexity, competition, and cost are three barriers to entry for new, more efficient technologies and retrofitted systems. A CBAM policy could not only encourage reduced carbon intensity of the industrial sector globally, but also help adapt U.S. supply chains and promote investments in clean and efficient equipment and facilities here at home.",,N,,2025-05-30 17:08:55.555711

As with many cities and towns, if an economy doesn't change with the times, opportunities for work and personal growth can stagnate. Change is crucial.

Historically, the industries of Spokane, Washington were natural resources-related, including mining and timber. ""It's modified over the years to a place where health care, health sciences, and education are really a big part of what we have in the city,"" says Mayor Lisa Brown.

""We have a very diversified economy,"" adding that what she calls 'emerging sectors' - aerospace, tech, and clean energy - are also fueling expansion.

Located in eastern Washington, Spokane has a population of 230,000. About 81% of Spokane's population identifies as white alone, 7.8% as Hispanic or Latino, 2.9% as Asian alone, 2.7% as Black alone, and 1.3% as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Brown says the area is dominated by the baby boomer generation, but the evolving economy is making Spokane more appealing to a younger population. She says goals for expanding housing, being mindful around land use, and ensuring a good transit system means, ""We can be a more attractive, affordable place for young people.""

Brown assumed her mayoral role in 2024, for a term that runs through 2027. Among her previous roles, she was chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, a state legislator, and director of the Washington State Department of Commerce.

She is using her past experiences in education, government, and business development to pull together a coalition of community thought leaders who are connecting local residents to career opportunities with the goal of building a strong economy.

An even bigger goal is putting residents on the pathway to economic mobility and prosperity.

Exploring Careers at a Young Age

""I describe us as 'infrastructure builders.' We think about the types of things, the conditions that need to be created for us all to be successful 10 years from now, for the economy to grow, and for us all to prosper,"" says Erin Vincent, VP of education and talent at Greater Spokane Inc. (GSI) - the region's business development organization.

GSI notes, ""We can't do this work alone. We partner with local businesses, our community, nonprofits, and the surrounding region to build a robust regional economy.""

Vincent says, ""In my area of workforce development, that means working on childcare. It means working on career-connected learning, thinking about how we can create the conditions for students to think about whatever their best future might be from that postsecondary perspective. It means supporting K-12 education.""

She says young students are getting a glimpse at the idea of careers in a variety of ways, including through career fairs, members of industry visiting schools, and education-focused programming on a local television outlet.

""Whether it's trades, apprenticeships, two-year, four-year, any of those options are great options. They are right for a lot of kids,"" says Vincent. ""The real key is that idea of creating an atmosphere of valuing whatever best suits a student.""

Experiential Learning Introduces Students to Potential Careers

A GSI initiative - Business AfterSchool - gives local students in grades 6-12 the chance to ""gain real-life skills and experiential learning in a workplace setting.""

Vincent says, ""In terms of a mindset perspective, there's probably no better way to actually get a kid to start seeing themselves as X, Y, Z than to actually get them there."" She says about 12 host businesses participate in Business AfterSchool during the academic year.

Vincent says one such business is Wagstaff, Inc., a longstanding partner that brings students in-house to observe various jobs on the manufacturing floor.

The manufacturing workforce pipeline needs a boost, according to Wade Larson, Wagstaff's director of workforce development.

""We did a study for Department of Commerce in the state about three years ago on the workforce for advanced manufacturing and aerospace. Bottom line - we don't have the numbers.""

He says bringing students to Wagstaff for Business AfterSchool is a valuable in-person experience, ""'I need you to come see us. Do cool stuff.' The idea is to capture some of these kids when they come out of high school.""

A more in-depth Wagstaff experience is the Production & Manufacturing Institute (PMI) - a three-week summer immersion program for incoming high school juniors and seniors.

""The students work as product teams to design, manufacture, and sell actual products for customers,"" explains Larson. ""In the meantime, we'll teach 'em a little bit of welding, a little bit of machining, take 'em out to live sites. And through this whole thing, they get to make money. They get to make stuff. They have a full experience.""

He says a lot of effort is made collecting feedback from the students and teacher participants - what they like and don't like, how the experience can be enhanced.

Helping Local Schools Shape Curriculum

Larson notes challenges faced by educators - not being able to always teach what's needed by industry. ""We're not telling the schools what we need. The schools are doing their best to figure it out themselves, but we in business need to step up, take the lead, throw money at it, and step into the classroom to say, 'Here we are. Let us help.'""

The Spokane Public Schools - which offers CTE (career and technical education) programming - states, "" With rising tuition costs, many high school graduates are looking toward trade apprenticeship programs as satisfying alternative career paths.""

Courses are available for both middle and high school students. The district says, ""Middle school CTE courses are exploratory, covering STEM, video production, and publishing.

""In high school, all courses are categorized into one of the 16 nationally recognized Career Clusters, which group jobs and industries by related skills or products/services. Courses typically progress from exploratory to preparatory stages, offering opportunities such as dual credit (college credit), industry certifications, internships, or apprenticeships.""

Opportunities for Advanced Manufacturing

Aerospace and tech are among the sector shifts in Spokane mentioned by Brown. The region's American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center (AAMMC) is expected to be ""critical to advancing U.S. economic and national security by onshoring and upscaling manufacturing technologies that support our domestic aircraft supply chain.""

Brown says, ""We have been awarded a significant stream of funding - upwards of $40 million. I will say that this is something that has broad sector support. We've got bipartisan senators supportive of this. So, we're cautiously hopeful that our funds are secure and that we really can make these key investments to build out the vision.""

The AAMMC already has a designated location at a former Triumph aerospace facility, notes Brown. ""This is not just a concept on a piece of paper. There's a facility. There is a set of workforce certificates being developed at the higher ed level and the set of collaborations around how to potentially engage in a scale-up of some manufacturing.""

She says, additionally, the facility will require advanced-level research and a test bed for next-generation materials to see if they're appropriate for the aerospace sector.

""This Tech Hub really brought stakeholders across the workforce system together because the capacity is there. We need everybody.

""We need the colleges, we need the K-12 system, we need the Workforce Councils, and the other training partners,"" says Shana Peschek, executive director of the Machinists Institute - the nonprofit arm of IAM District 751 (International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers).

""That's really where we see ourselves, especially around helping people understand what these careers are.""

Peschek says about the Tech Hub, ""We are leasing a small footprint there. We had a meeting to talk about what exact skills they would want us teaching around those materials - composites and thermal plastics.

""The partnership means that we'll have students in the building where this amazing facility is operating, really being innovative, and a global leader - and the employers and manufacturers have access to individuals from the region that are being skilled-up in that technology.""

Aside from the Tech Hub, the Institute has been involved in skills training for a number of years. Established in 2018, the Institute offers a pre-apprenticeship program called Machinists Institute Career Accelerator (MICA), as well as six Registered Apprenticeship pathways including machinist, industrial machinery technician, and fabrication welder.

Peschek notes in addition to aerospace and advanced manufacturing, other industries are under the Machinists' umbrella including maritime, clean energy, and supply chain.

The Institute is currently expanding its own current training and education center in Spokane. Expected to launch in July, Peschek says the offerings will include welding, machining, and heavy equipment/diesel.

Postsecondary Education Collaboration

Collaboration with community colleges has been highly productive, according to Peschek. ""Our machinist apprentices can get an associate degree at the same time that they journey out.

""We've been really breaking down barriers because we really want our students to understand that this degree, whether they felt like they needed one or not, it's there in the future - just in case - and helps open advanced pathways for them.""

She says Spokane Community College (SCC) has been an important partner.

Brown adds, ""We support people moving into the trades through apprenticeships. And now pre-apprenticeships. Through pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships, we're also trying to create pathways into more specialized training.""

In order to help get qualified applicants into an apprenticeship program, SCC offers an apprenticeship prep course - Skilled Trades Preparation (STP), explains Kenna May, the school's manager of apprenticeship.

STP runs for 11 weeks, 24 hours per week. May says in addition to spending three hours per day in the shop, students learn extensively about workplace safety.

She notes, ""They also build a tiny house - all the components for that house. They do the blueprints, the framing, the drywall, the roofing. They'll put in doors and windows. They'll run electricity to them. Our goal is to really teach them a little bit about a lot of different trades.""

May notes that about 50% of the students that complete STP will move to a Registered Apprenticeship program - compared to the statewide articulation average of about 38%.

Regarding apprenticeship, she says, ""It's a combination of on-the-job training and classroom time. The college is the classroom portion of apprenticeship. Less than 10% of actual apprenticeship training is in the classroom.

""The majority of the training is done on the job. Our programs vary in length between two and five years, depending on the craft.""

May says the five-year programs include those pathways for electricians, sheet metal workers, plumbers, and steam fitters. Laborers and bricklayers are shorter programs.

She notes SCC's Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Center is made available for use by several other programs that do not have their own training facilities - at no cost. Overall, SCC partners with 19 different programs representing about 27 trades, according to May.

When someone expresses interest in a particular pathway, May says, that person is referred to the specific program to apply. The program - not SCC - leads the process. ""You do testing in their interview process, then once they accept you in their program - they'll get you a job and put you out to work. Then they give a schedule to the students for when they're going to be coming in for class,"" she explains.

May reminds apprenticeship is dependent upon the economy. ""Our programs are not going to take apprentices if there's not a job for them. Our programs do look to the future of jobs coming up and try to anticipate how many they're going to need.""

Entry into the Trades for People with Barriers to Employment

The Pre-Employment Preparation Program (PEPP) is a hands-on pre-apprenticeship course - that consists of 160 hours over four weeks.

""We work with the building trades and all of our students who graduate with their certifications have a designated benefit of direct entry into the trade that they feel they want to do the most,"" says Shannon Corrick, PEPP's executive director.

According to PEPP, the program encourages ""disenfranchised individuals or those who are working low-wage jobs to apply for the PEPP class.

""We are also working closely with the criminal justice system to assist as many individuals as possible to enroll in PEPP immediately upon reentering the community so that they can be prepared to enter a family-wage apprenticeship position following completion of their PEPP class.""

Corrick notes that wraparound services are a key PEPP component. ""We can take care of their housing for a month. We can take care of their power bill for a month, their phone bill, their internet bill, their car payment, and then daycare, absolutely 100% daycare.

""We like to say it's not a handout, it's a hand up.""

Participants who complete the training earn certifications including OSHA 10, flagging (traffic control), CPR, and forklift qualification credential.

Corrick says trainees have had success transitioning into the trades, ""As far as our grants and our North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) certification, we are required to have 15% placements. That's our bare minimum. I do know from the September class, we have a 60% placement rate.""

Health Care Pathways

Brown says, ""We're not known necessarily as a health sciences city, but we have this health sciences cluster.""

""One in five people in Spokane County works in health care. It's our largest industry,"" says Erin William Hueter, executive director of Health Sciences and Services Authority (HSSA) of Spokane County. ""Our focus is on biosciences economic development and the promotion of public health. And we do that mostly through grantmaking,""

Williams Hueter says, ""So, connection to that research and growing that field is beneficial to the health of the residents of our region. But also, these are well-paying jobs. When we have people that are earning a good income and have a stable base in their economic lives, their health improves because they have access to health care in new ways.

""I think what's important about the development of really innovative technologies, innovative practices in health care, when you're in a community where so many of us work in health care and every single one of us is impacted by the health care delivery system - seeing that job growth, seeing new people being trained in that area, it's just critical to our wellbeing.""

As a former chancellor at Washington State University Spokane, Brown says, ""When I was at WSU Spokane, we created the state's second public medical school. So now we actually have both the University of Washington and WSU Medical School.""

Williams Hueter adds the organization - through its grant awards - is addressing the area's provider shortage, particularly how long it takes to see a primary care doctor. ""Contracts have been signed addressing provider shortages. So, we've got organizations that are addressing it through working to train more professionals.""

Grant recipients include Asante Health, Joya Child and Family Development Center, Latinos En Spokane, and Maddie's Place .

""What an incredible resource to have two medical schools in our region because - boy, do we need health care providers. Not just in Spokane County, but in the more rural areas that surround Spokane County, as well. Seeing those doctors stay in the area is so important,"" says Williams Hueter.

Pacific Northwest University - which has an osteopathic medicine program and is based in Yakima - also has a presence in Spokane.

Traci Couture Richmond, executive director of Spokane Teaching Health Center (STHC), explains, ""We are training family medicine and internal medicine residents. They've graduated from medical school. They now have come to their residency. And so, in Spokane, we are responsible for developing the next primary care workforce here.""

She also addresses the need for these doctors, ""What you're seeing is people are being forced into urgent cares, in emergency rooms to take care of issues that they're having - in settings that are not appropriate. That could be prevented by access to primary care.""

In addition, Couture Richmond says Psychiatry Residency Spokane - which is affiliated with both the University of Washington and Washington State University - has its outpatient clinic located at STHC.

""Their residents are here embedded with our internal medicine and family medicine residents. They're able to learn from each other.""

Couture Richmond says not everyone is comfortable seeing a resident for treatment, ""Residency clinics have kind of a quiet stigma - 'I don't want to go there because they're not real doctors.' And they are. They're doctors that are learning. You're also being seen by one of their preceptors who's been a physician for a long period of time.""

Upon completion of their residencies, a number of doctors remain in Spokane or rural communities outside of the area, she notes.

""Of our internal medicine program, we're retaining about 55 to 60% of those in the Spokane area. Many in internal medicine, typically they go off to be a hospitalist or then they move into a critical care fellowship.

""Family medicine has been a little bit of a different story for us. We have retained around 20%, but the other large group of them are going out into small rural communities and practicing the medicine that they were trained to do. From birth to death, they're doing all of that care in these small rural communities.""

The Emerging Clean Energy Sector

Brown says, ""There's really interesting stuff happening in clean energy. I mean, we have this river and waterpower. We've developed solar and wind in eastern Washington, and that has led to now looking at batteries and things like that.""

Spokane has a number of environmental initiatives around renewable energy, urban forestry, and stormwater and wastewater, among others. The local Water Department owns and operates the Upriver Hydroelectric Dam on the Spokane River.

""The basic idea is that the climate crisis continues to get worse and institutions like Gonzaga University have a real clear sense of our mission which involves graduating students who are people - for and with others - who want to create a just society and have care for a common home,"" explains Brian G. Henning, Ph.D., director of the Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment.

The Gonzaga Climate Institute ""engages in regional capacity building, scholarship, and teaching to promote the flourishing of Inland Northwest communities, waters, and lands in the face of a changing climate.""

Henning says the school offers a BA in environmental studies, a BS in environmental science, as well as a sustainable business minor in the School of Business. ""Those are the programs that are most obviously connected to understanding different aspects of the environment, and we get really amazing students in all of those programs.""

Gonzaga offers career resources for students who complete these areas of study for post-university life.

There are hiring opportunities for students while they are still in school, according to Henning. ""The Climate Literacy Project was one of our very first projects. We started hiring Gonzaga students who serve as climate literacy fellows.

""They're typically environmental studies or environmental science students, but they could be from any discipline. We train them and they go in pairs into K-8 classrooms, and they deliver hands-on climate science lessons.""

He says some of the program's fellows have gone on to pursue environmental education as a career - for example, working for nonprofits in different parts of the country or for the [National] Park Service.

For learners anywhere, Henning says there is the opportunity to earn a professional certificate in climate action planning. He says, ""That program is available to community members from around the world who are interested in helping their communities develop plans for how to understand, how to be resilient, and how to reduce their contributions to climate change.""

Additionally, the Gonzaga Climate Institute created the Climate Resilience Project in 2022 in ""response to the increasing need for extreme heat research and community action."" Henning says, ""We hire students who are climate project assistants...who work 10 to 15 hours a week. They're doing research, they're doing community engagement, they're helping to coordinate and facilitate the combination of those two.""

Due to the threat of wildfire and the resulting smoke, Henning says they are ""developing heat and smoke response plans with the City of Spokane.""

He also mentions the Cataldo Project - which he describes as ""a curriculum and pedagogy workshop that Gonzaga faculty from any discipline can take.

""They come for a two-day workshop to explore how they can incorporate climate and sustainability concepts into their courses, their existing classes - not so much by dislodging content - but by infusing sustainability and climate themes.""

'Where is our village for our parents?'

As the conversation between Brown and WorkingNation was wrapping, she made a point to add, ""I'm very passionate about pre-K and early learning.

""I think a lot of it starts there. And the community is also coming together collaboratively around that sector and around childcare workers and people who are in early learning They need to be supported in order to get this whole thing off the ground right from the very beginning.""

""I really dug my heels into this idea of being a tool of healing and safety for the community, but also to focus on the education of early learners and to ensure that they were kindergarten-ready,"" says Kerra Bower, owner of Little Scholars Development Center and founder of Raze Development. ""We really started building our program to ensure that we closed the education gap as much as we possibly could.""

The programming serves children from four months to 12 years.

""The Maasai tribe asks that question, 'How are the children?' The idea is if the children are well and our community is well, then we are thriving,"" says Bower.

""My question has been, and will always be, 'Where is our village? Where is our village for our parents?' It is incredibly important. In all my programs, across the board, they're built on this idea that the parent is the cornerstone teacher. We are there to support the parent because if the parent is healthy and whole, then we're raising whole healthy humans.""

Bower says she first met Brown when she was with the Washington State Department of Commerce. ""One of the things I said to her [around childcare] was, 'This is a workforce development issue. This is an economic vitality and upward mobility issue. If you don't have a stable childcare environment and industry, you don't have workforce development or economic vitality.'""

After winning her run for mayor, Brown appointed Bower to her transition team. Bower says, ""She could have very well put me into the family engagement and family connection group, which is a very important group.

""But instead, she put me in the workforce and economic development group. I was the only childcare provider, and I would even venture to say the only actual small business in that group. For me, it really pinpointed her understanding.""

Bower says in addition to parents and their children, the teachers and caregivers need support, as well. ""We have to be able to provide a balance for them, and that comes in the form of the mental and behavioral health supports that are readily available to them in their classrooms.

""These are human beings. These are not childcare whisperers. They're not super humans. They are people who just happen to love little people. It's humanizing the individuals that are in your classrooms.""

'Quality of life-focused'

""I want the city to grow and thrive for my son, for my grandson, and for the future,"" says Brown. ""We're the second largest city in Washington State. The region is very quality of life-focused.""

An unsuccessful bid for Congress caused a shift in Brown's perspective. ""It got me even more connected to the region, to the city. I felt like the change that I wanted to see - if I couldn't help make it happen at the national level - that really here was the right place.""

She acknowledges that she is not doing the work alone. ""The best part of this job is that really I deeply engaged and networked. I know higher ed leaders. I know business leaders. I know nonprofit leaders, activists, and so that has made it easier for me.""

Wrapping Up The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution.","The electric vehicle landscape in Canada has witnessed a significant power shift in the first quarter of 2025. General Motors (GM) has surged ahead of Tesla in overall EV sales, marking a dramatic turn in a market that many previously considered to be firmly in Tesla's grasp. This remarkable feat comes on the back of a staggering 252% year-over-year increase in GM's electric vehicle sales, fueled by a compelling lineup of new and increasingly popular models. The vehicles leading this charge are the highly anticipated Chevrolet Equinox EV, the robust Silverado EV, and the stylish Cadillac OPTIQ.

This surge in GM's EV sales contrasts sharply with the fortunes of the former Canadian EV sales leader, Tesla. In a stunning reversal, Tesla experienced an 87% drop in sales, plummeting from 5,097 units in the fourth quarter of 2024 to a mere 534 units in the first quarter of 2025. This precipitous decline points to a confluence of factors that have seemingly impacted the brand's appeal and market position in Canada.

Factors Behind Tesla's Sales Plunge

Several elements appear to have contributed to Tesla's significant sales drop in Canada. One key factor is the suspension of both federal and provincial electric vehicle incentives. Canada's Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) program, which offered up to CA$5,000 in federal rebates, paused indefinitely on January 12th, 2025, after allocated funds were fully exhausted. Additionally, Quebec's Roulez vert program, a significant provincial incentive, also saw a temporary suspension. The removal of these financial incentives has undoubtedly made EVs, including Teslas, less accessible to a wider range of consumers, impacting overall sales volumes.

Beyond the economic factors, the actions and public persona of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, particularly his alignment with the current US administration, appear to be taking a toll on the brand's reputation and consequently, its sales in Canada. Marketing experts suggest that Musk's outspoken political views have alienated a significant portion of potential buyers who may not align with his stance. In a market like Canada, which often holds distinct political and social views compared to the US, such brand association can have a tangible impact on consumer preferences.

GM's Winning Strategy: Diverse Lineup and Neutral Stance

In contrast to Tesla's challenges, GM's success in Canada seems to stem from a combination of a more diverse EV lineup and a more politically neutral public image. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, with 1,892 units sold in Q1 2025, led GM's charge GM takes over as the '#1 EV seller' in Canada - Electrek. This affordable electric SUV caters to a broad segment of the market looking for a practical and cost-effective EV option. The Silverado EV, with 894 units sold, taps into the popular pickup truck segment, offering an electric alternative to a traditionally gasoline-dominated category. Finally, the Cadillac OPTIQ, with 615 units sold, provides a compelling entry point into the luxury EV market for the GM brand. This diverse portfolio allows GM to appeal to a wider range of buyers with varying needs and preferences.

While direct evidence linking GM's political neutrality to its success in China is less quantifiable, anecdotal observations suggest that in politically sensitive markets, a less overtly political stance can be beneficial. GM has maintained a relatively low public profile regarding contentious political issues, focusing instead on its products and its commitment to the Chinese market. While GM has faced challenges in China, with an overall sales decline in the previous year, there were signs of rebound in the fourth quarter. This suggests that GM's strategy of focusing on its vehicle offerings and maintaining a less polarizing public image may be resonating with consumers in key markets like China, mirroring its current success in Canada.

Wrapping Up

The shift in Canadian EV market share, with GM surpassing Tesla in the first quarter of 2025, underscores the dynamic nature of the electric vehicle revolution. While the suspension of government incentives has undoubtedly played a role, Tesla's significant sales decline also points to the potential impact of brand perception and the actions of its leadership. GM's success, on the other hand, highlights the strength of a diverse EV lineup that caters to different segments of the market, coupled with a potentially advantageous neutral political stance, which may also be contributing to their performance in other significant global markets like China. This Canadian snapshot serves as a compelling reminder that in the rapidly evolving EV landscape, product diversity, market sensitivity, and even the perceived neutrality of a brand can be crucial factors in achieving and maintaining market leadership.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits.
The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs.
“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond.
“The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace.","Solar energy is increasingly popular among faith-based institutions. Recently, two synagogues, thousands of miles apart but with similar economic and environmental commitments, have installed solar arrays on their buildings. In California, the Valley Beth Shalom (VBS) synagogue installed 425 kilowatts’ (kW) worth of solar panels to lower energy costs, increase sustainability, and provide an educational opportunity to the community.1 With similar purposes in mind, the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center (MVHC) in Massachusetts installed 75 solar panels, providing 30 kW of energy, in 2023.

Both VBS and the MVHC took advantage of direct pay, the monetization of clean energy tax credits for nonprofits. Until 2022, only organizations with a tax liability could access clean energy tax credits; nonprofits and tax-exempt entities were locked out from claiming such credits when installing solar panels or other clean energy measures. Thanks to the elective pay (a.k.a. direct pay) option introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) (P.L. 117-169), these entities can claim tax incentives when investing in clean energy projects, such as solar energy, ground-source heat pumps, and battery storage devices. These small-scale renewable energy projects enable lower energy bills and increased resilience and can help create quality contractor and installation jobs, generating local wealth and spurring further demand for these distributed technologies.

Without direct pay, VBS and the MVHC would have struggled to install solar panels and reap their full benefits. Direct pay is a game-changer because it gives nonprofits access to the same financial incentives that for-profit companies have received for years when investing in renewable energy. As the monetization of a tax credit, direct pay is not a point-of-sale rebate or a federal grant.

Federal tax credits are handled by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), so nonprofits seeking to claim direct pay must complete IRS Forms 3468 and 3800, along with their 990-T tax returns. They must file them the year after the eligible clean energy project is “put into service.” Depending on when the clean energy project was installed and placed into service and when the tax return was filed, the entire process can take anywhere between four and 18 months.

In March 2025, the MVHC received the base 30% direct pay payment for its solar array installation, which was put into service last year.2 While most organizations can expect to claim between 30 and 50% of a project’s costs, if the law’s bonus credits are stacked, they can claim up to 70% of the total cost of domestically-sourced projects located in low-income communities. There is no limit to the number of eligible projects a nonprofit can claim direct pay for in a single tax year.

VBS and the MVHC are not alone in pursuing environmental and financial stability by installing solar panels on their buildings. According to a 2023 federal report, places of worship had installed more than 2,500 solar systems by the end of 2021, representing approximately 170 megawatts (MW) of capacity—enough to power more than 28,500 households for one year. With these solar installations, houses of worship collectively avoid 236,000 tons of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to removing nearly 50,000 cars from the road. Now that houses of worship can benefit from the same tax credits afforded to commercial businesses, their solar installations are expected to accelerate considerably.

Valley Beth Shalom Installs Solar Panels to “Repair the World”

Driven by sustainability, community, and financial considerations, Valley Beth Shalom completed the installation of 868 Q-Cell rooftop solar panels this month, making it the largest solar array installation in a California synagogue and one of the largest for a synagogue in the entire country. Informed by Jewish environmental values, VBS installed solar panels on almost every square foot of the 130,000-square-foot roof of the main building on its five-acre campus in Encino, California. Working with Sunistics Group, which designed the solar installation, VBS initiated construction of the solar array in December 2024.

The 425 kW solar array is expected to save the synagogue approximately 614,552 kWh annually, equivalent to $180,014. By generating clean energy locally, VBS will replace 80% of the energy it currently sources from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, VBS's local utility. While 43.4% of the utility’s energy mix comes from renewable sources (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric), 42.7% still comes from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal.

Installing solar panels is a financially viable investment for nonprofit organizations like VBS. Energy costs are the second-highest operational expense for many nonprofits, behind only salaries. The clean energy from solar panels offsets the relatively expensive energy from the power grid, resulting in long-term reductions in energy costs. At VBS, the savings will be invested in educational programs and hands-on learning opportunities for students and families in the community, advancing environmental stewardship and empowering the next generation to embrace sustainability. VBS will develop programs centered around the installed solar panels to educate the community about renewable energy and the connection between sustainability and Jewish values.

The total cost for the solar array installation reached $1.2 million, including inverters. VBS received several grants, low-interest loans, and donations from the community to finance the solar panels. Through the Jewish Solar Challenge, VBS received a $150,000 grant in 2023. In that same year, VBS secured a $100,000 zero-percent interest loan from the Adamah Climate Action Fund, a loan program run by Adamah, a national Jewish climate organization that VBS is a member of. Additionally, as a nonprofit organization, VBS will apply for direct pay this year, once the panels are put into service, to recoup at least 30% of the project costs.

""Everything that we do at Valley Beth Shalom revolves around tikkun olam, or ‘repair the world’,"" said Matthew Weintraub, executive director at VBS. “We are good stewards of the environment, an integral part of our Jewish values. We focus on spending money and energy on things that make an impact on the community.”

Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center

Looking to make a significant contribution to its community amid high electricity rates, the MVHC decided to install solar panels. The center completed a 76-panel 30 kW array in May 2023 and put it into service in July of that year. The total cost for the solar array installation was $76,000. The 30 kW solar array is already saving the MVHC hundreds of dollars annually, which they used to install a new heat pump in place of their old propane-fueled furnace.

“In 2022, we installed solar panels in our house, and we wanted to do the same for the Hebrew Center,"" said Ricky Diamond, the first vice president of the MVHC. “We are a small community with 324 members, with many concerned about climate change and how to get off fossil fuels. We saw solar panels as a way to do good for the environment, the community, and save money on our utility bills.”

As a nonprofit organization, the center filed for a 30% direct pay disbursement for its solar panels in June 2024 through IRS forms 990-T, 3800, and 3468. Due to the novelty of the direct pay process, Ricky and his wife Batya had difficulty finding an accountant who was familiar with the required paperwork for nonprofits seeking clean energy credits, so they filed themselves. After months of back-and-forth with the IRS, the MVHC received a check for $24,405.85 in March 2025, representing 30% of the solar project’s costs, plus interest from the IRS for issuing the direct pay payment late.

As a tax-exempt house of worship, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center was never obliged to file tax returns with the IRS. But because direct pay credits are processed through an organization’s tax return, the center had to file a tax return in 2024, the year after its eligible clean energy project was put into service, to claim its credits. The Hebrew Center will not need to file tax returns in subsequent years, unless it claims credits for future projects.

Through its communications with the IRS, the MVHC discovered that, as a first-time tax filer, it could determine the starting month of its tax year without being tied to the calendar year. Given that the clean energy system was fully commissioned with its local utility in July 2023, Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center decided to start its tax year that month, and end it in June 2024.

“From a financial and an environmental point of view, it was worthwhile to install the solar panels,” said Diamond. “The solar panels are helping us get rid of fossil fuels as we used the savings from the solar panels and installed a heat pump to replace the propane-fueled furnace. We are slowly becoming energy independent.”

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management appears to be promoting the polluting of mountain views with supposedly green energy. Multiple pages on bureau’s website for siting wind energy on public lands show the same photo of dozens of wind turbines blocking the view of snow-covered mountains.

“Renewables are booming” proclaims a November 2024 headline on the Sierra Club website, right above a picture of a sunset blocked by wind turbines.

The page for “Renewable Energy” from the Union of Concerned Scientists boasts of “little or no pollution” and then provides a photo of wind turbines filling a mountain pass.

The Natural Resources Defense Council website promotes a photo of dozens of wind turbines filling the scenery underneath a snow-capped mountain. The caption reads: “Limiting dirty fossil fuel production and transitioning to clean energy, like wind and solar, are critical in building a livable future.”

Inherent Hypocrisy

Though unintentional, this cheerleading is an honest portrayal of two serious and hypocritical problems inherent in weather-dependent energy systems:

They must devour a lot of land—otherwise known as “the environment” that the environmental groups claim to be conserving.

The windy and sunny land (and ocean frontage) these systems need are often the same open spaces humans enjoy looking at and living near.

A 2021 analysis from Bloomberg News, titled “The U.S. Will Need a Lot of Land for a Zero-Carbon Economy,” came to this conclusion:

Wind farms, solar installations and other forms of clean power take up far more space on a per-watt basis than their fossil-fuel-burning brethren. A 200-megawatt wind farm, for instance, might require spreading turbines over 19 square miles (49 square kilometres). A natural gas power plant with that same generating capacity could fit onto a single city block. [emphasis added]

The Bloomberg report provided this graphic to explain that getting comparable wattage from wind requires 370 times more land than natural gas, and that solar needs 140 times as much land:

As shown above, obtaining electricity from carbon-free nuclear power is also far gentler on land use than wind and solar. Bloomberg provided this commentary:

Natural gas and nuclear energy are very compact power sources. A conventional 1-gigawatt reactor operating on 1,000 acres produces the same power as a wind farm spanning 100,000 acres.

For perspective, 100,000 acres is the equivalent of 156 square miles—or a hunk of the Earth larger than major cities such as Detroit, Michigan.

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy reached this conclusion:

Despite producing massive amounts of carbon-free power, nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. A typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear facility in the United States needs a little more than 1 square mile to operate . . . you would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor or more than 430 wind turbines.

BACKGROUND According to Bloomberg, the cuts include funding to Heidelberg Materials and Sublime Systems for pilot projects to manufacture low-carbon cement.","WASHINGTON, DC — Following a pattern of cutting federal programs led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the Department of Energy (DOE) today announced it was canceling $3.7 billion in funding for 24 clean energy projects through its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).

Many of the canceled projects focused on carbon capture or low-carbon cement. 17 of the canceled projects are from the Industrial Demonstrations Program, which aims to support the decarbonization of heavy industries like steel, cement, and aluminum. The announcement comes less than a month after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright testified before Congress that no OCED cut lists existed.

In response to the news, the Sierra Club’s Industrial Transformation campaign issued the following statements:

“DOGE and the Trump Administration have just killed dozens of major investments in American competitiveness, good jobs, and cleaner air to support Trump’s tax cuts and line the pockets of billionaires. These projects were not just pro-climate; they were pro-jobs, pro-innovation, and pro-public health. American workers, fenceline communities, and forward-thinking companies have had the rug pulled out from under them,” said Iliana Paul, deputy director for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

“As part of the agreement for receiving the grants, companies were all required to engage with the community and address some of the biggest concerns that local residents had with the project. These included pollution and public safety concerns, alongside hiring local workers and investing in programs that would benefit local residents. By pulling the plug from 24 projects, the Trump administration and DOGE are taking away efforts that would support the wellbeing and economic vitality of manufacturing communities. This is a betrayal of public trust,” said Yong Kwon, senior advisor for the Industrial Transformation campaign at the Sierra Club.

BACKGROUND

According to Bloomberg, the cuts include funding to Heidelberg Materials and Sublime Systems for pilot projects to manufacture low-carbon cement. Earlier this week, Sublime announced it had signed an agreement with Microsoft to buy more than 600,000 tons of its low-carbon cement — which calls into question the Trump administration’s argument that the canceled projects were not “economically viable.”

Interestingly, the cut list did not include funding to Cleveland Cliffs for a project to transition its coal-reliant steelmaking processes to hydrogen — despite the fact that the Cleveland Cliffs CEO said in May that it would use the money to instead reline the blast furnace at its Middletown, Ohio facility to extend their lifespan and continue their reliance on coal — which is clearly outside of the original scope of OCED funding for clean energy projects.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:40.477302

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former president Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said.

The U.S. Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What Has Been Cancelled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles, and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also cancelled prior to 2025.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The U.S. on the Global Stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy, withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, dismissing scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources, and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has proposed to include a CBAM in the new trading relationships his new government plans to negotiate with more reliable international partners.

The International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping, AP says, though the IMO’s record for delivery on its climate promises has been shaky at best.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan. Across the U.S., 24 Democrat-led states representing 50% of the country’s population and 60% of its GDP are recommitting to reducing their climate pollution and carrying on the energy transition.

But they can’t do it all on their own, and $4.5 billion in development was cancelled or delayed last month alone, according to E2’s tally.

This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.
This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories.
E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025.","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 kicked off a 10-year clean energy industrial policy in the United States, but it is now under threat of having core elements repealed via the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that has been approved by the House of Representatives and next faces a vote by the Senate.

Unprecedented announcements in U.S. clean energy followed the 2022 law. E2 tracks these announcements in its Clean Economy Works report. Since the IRA was passed, over 390 clean energy projects in 42 states representing over $130 billion in investment and 120,000 jobs have been announced, according to the report.

However, if the Senate passes the budget resolution as-written, core elements of the IRA, including the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, will be repealed for projects not placed in service by 2028. This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.

This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories. E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025. About $4.5 billion in cancellations occurred in April alone, said E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, director of communications, E2.

What’s more, most of the cancelled investments occurred in Republican districts. Democratic House members unanimously voted against the budget bill, but it was approved by a razor-thin majority due to strong Republican support.

More than $12 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican voting districts thus far, said E2. Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Timberlake.

Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

The cost of a U.S. House of Representatives bill to abruptly sunset clean energy tax credits could be significant in New York.

U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said the impact of the bill could reach a loss of more than 20,000 jobs and endanger $5 billion in clean manufacturing investments. It’s also expected to increase energy costs for American households by as much as 7%, while increasing pollution.

It’s also ceding ground in the renewable market to China, Schumer said, which produces a majority of the world’s solar panels and increased its solar capacity to 880 gigawatts in 2024. The bill passed the House in May and is now working its way through the U.S. Senate.

The $5 billion in investment coming to New York in wind, solar, battery, electric vehicle and other clean manufacturing was tied to Inflation Reduction Act funding.

“If they eliminate those tax credits, study after study shows we’ll have fewer companies coming here,” Schumer said. “Projects will be dramatically scaled back and up to 20,000 jobs would be lost in construction and manufacturing.”

Business and individual incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, including electric vehicle tax credits, are on the chopping block in the House bill.

Tech-neutral electricity tax credits have been the most affected, requiring a quick-turn on projects or risk losing funding. The House bill would require:

Repeal of credits for projects starting construction more than 60 days after enactment

Projects beginning within the 60-day period must be in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

The changes would exempt nuclear projects from the 60-day requirement, but would still need to be in service by the 2028 deadline.

Changes to solar credits for your home panels

It would also specifically eliminate credit for leased residential solar installations for any taxable year beginning after enactment. Tax credits for geothermal energy would be reduced by 20% each year starting in 2029 ahead of a 2031 sunset.

Schumer blamed the fossil fuel lobby on the House vote in favor of the bill, despite the growing demand for electricity and the low startup costs of renewables like solar.

“The fossil fuel industry knows their days are numbered because the new kinds of clean power are … not only cleaner, but cheaper and quicker to implement,” the senator said. “And so they want to kill this industry just as it’s really getting started and causing job growth. That’s a damn disgrace.”

Schumer said he’s a supporter of bipartisan efforts to reform permit approvals for grid lines and pipelines to get energy from renewable energy installations to where people live.

“It’s too hard to build these power lines right now,” Schumer said. “So there’s bipartisan hope to pass this permitting reform and the tax credits go hand-in-hand with permitting reform.”","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/03/PROC/74290070007-sd-070224-hub-6.jpg?crop=4033,2267,x0,y240&width=3200&height=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 15:21:14.702517

The tech giant will support the early-stage development of three advanced nuclear energy sites from Elementl across the United States, each designed to deliver a minimum of 600 megawatts, for a combined capacity of 1.8 gigawatts.

Announced in early May, the agreement marks another inflection point in Google’s broader strategy to secure scalable, carbon-free baseload power capable of supporting the exponential energy demands of AI-centric data centers. The partnership also signals the sector's growing confidence in advanced nuclear technologies as a viable path to long-term sustainability and energy resilience in digital infrastructure.

Founded in 2022, Elementl Power aims to deploy over 10 gigawatts of advanced nuclear capacity by 2035. Google’s investment will fund key early-phase activities including site permitting, regulatory engagement, and commercial structuring. The backing of a hyperscale player like Google gives Elementl a formidable launch pad—and underscores the intensifying race among tech giants to lock in low-carbon power at scale.

As AI workloads push data center energy requirements to unprecedented levels, nuclear—once viewed as peripheral—is emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation power procurement strategies. With this move, Google isn’t just planning for the future; it's building it. The three Elementl facilities are expected to come online before the end of the decade, positioning Google to lead in deploying utility-scale nuclear energy for digital infrastructure.

Upon completion, Google will have the option to purchase power from these facilities. Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, reflecting on the importance of these types of investments, said:

Elementl Power Steps Into the Spotlight as a New Nuclear Catalyst

Founded just three years ago, Elementl Power is a relative newcomer to the nuclear energy landscape—but one with outsized ambition and strategic intent. Co-founder and President Ryan Mills describes the company as a purpose-built platform to address a critical industry gap: catalyzing private capital formation to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

According to Elementl’s mission statement, the company aims to bridge the divide between nuclear technology providers, utilities, and major energy buyers—entities increasingly seeking long-term, carbon-free baseload power as AI infrastructure scales globally.

While Elementl has yet to disclose detailed leadership bios or a track record of past projects, its high-profile partnership with Google is a significant validation. Beyond the investment itself, the collaboration gives Elementl a marquee partner and a proving ground for its “technology-agnostic” strategy—allowing it to source the most promising reactor designs tailored to individual site and grid requirements.

That flexibility may prove critical as the advanced nuclear sector works to commercialize a new generation of reactor technologies over the next decade.

With industry targets converging on the 2030–2035 window for the first wave of commercial deployment, Elementl’s ten-year runway is ambitious—but not implausible. Traditional nuclear development timelines often stretch 15 to 20 years; Elementl’s modular, adaptable approach offers a pragmatic counterpoint. Success will depend on navigating evolving regulatory frameworks, aligning with state-level energy policies, and keeping pace with innovation from a growing cohort of advanced reactor vendors. For Elementl, nimbleness may be as important as engineering.

Google’s Nuclear Playbook Extends Beyond Elementl

The Elementl deal builds on Google’s expanding footprint in nuclear innovation. In October 2024, the company signed a Master Plant Development Agreement with Kairos Power, a California-based startup focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs) using fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) technology. The agreement calls for the deployment of a fleet of Kairos reactors providing up to 500 megawatts of clean energy by 2035—an effort aimed squarely at meeting Google’s growing data center power demands with carbon-free baseload generation.

The first Kairos reactor is slated to go online by 2030, although full commercial deployment may extend several years beyond that. Still, the agreement marked a historic milestone: the first corporate commitment to procure energy from a network of SMRs, signaling a broader shift in how hyperscalers approach long-term energy procurement. Microsoft and Amazon have also engaged with next-gen nuclear developers through letters of intent, underscoring the rising stakes—and fierce competition—around securing future-proof power for data center growth.

Kairos Power, spun out of U.S. national laboratory and university research, has taken an iterative, vertically integrated approach to bring FHR technology to market. A key milestone came in December 2023, when the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a construction permit for Hermes, the company's low-power demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

This was the first construction permit granted for a non-light-water reactor in the United States in more than 50 years. Construction began in July 2024, and by May 2025, the first safety-related concrete was poured—marking real progress on what could be a pivotal commercial validation.

Backed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, Kairos believes it is on track to commercialize its reactor platform in the early 2030s. If successful, projects like Hermes could shift the economics and timelines of nuclear deployment across the data center industry—transforming how digital infrastructure is powered in an era of escalating AI workloads and decarbonization mandates.

U.S. Nuclear Momentum Accelerates Amid Policy Shifts and Hyperscale Demand

Google’s nuclear partnerships with Elementl Power and Kairos Power underscore a broader resurgence in U.S. nuclear energy—driven by hyperscale computing needs, evolving federal policy, and a maturing ecosystem of advanced reactor technologies.

In late May 2025, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved NuScale Power’s updated 77 MW small modular reactor (SMR) design, replacing its earlier 50 MW model. This milestone positions NuScale to potentially deploy its first SMR by decade’s end, contingent on securing a customer. Notably, NuScale is reportedly in discussions with five major data center operators, reflecting the sector’s growing interest in SMRs as scalable, carbon-free energy solutions.

Concurrently, President Trump’s administration has enacted a series of executive orders aimed at revitalizing the nuclear industry. These directives mandate expedited reactor licensing processes, authorize development on federal lands, and promote domestic uranium production. The policy shift has reportedly invigorated investor confidence, with companies like Oklo, Centrus Energy, and BWX Technologies experiencing significant stock gains.

The Department of Energy (DOE) is also advancing initiatives to bolster nuclear capacity. A comprehensive roadmap aims to add 35 GW of new capacity by 2035, with an annual addition of 15 GW by 2040. This plan includes repurposing existing power plant sites and transitioning coal plants to nuclear facilities.

In the private sector, tech giants are increasingly integrating nuclear energy into their infrastructure strategies. Amazon has partnered with Dominion Energy and X-energy to develop 5 GW of nuclear capacity, while Microsoft is exploring the revival of the Three Mile Island site for data center power. Oracle has announced plans for a gigawatt-scale data center powered by three SMRs, currently in the design phase.

These developments signal the rise of a transformative period for nuclear energy, aligning technological innovation with policy support and private investment to meet the escalating energy demands of the digital age.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/05/682e856ac597bbcb96f14058-hermesarchitectrenderingjuly2024_1200x630.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-30 17:08:20.913024

This opportunity is part of the CHARGE program (Communities Helping America Renew and Grow the Economy), a $156 million initiative aimed at supporting community solar and battery storage projects in EPA Regions 3, 4, and 6. Community-centered campuses such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) are encouraged to participate.

Awardees will work alongside local organizations to implement community solar projects designed to reduce household utility bills, with anticipated savings of up to $77 million for participating families. Additionally, these institutions will develop practical training programs to build a pipeline of skilled workers for the expanding clean energy economy. The program plans to establish 40 community solar projects generating 95 megawatts of power and 48 megawatt-hours of storage capacity. Approximately 8,870 households are expected to save around 25 percent on their energy bills, leading to a total of $77 million in household savings.

Teresa Morales, CHARGE Program Director, said in a statement, “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to empower communities like those served by Minority-Serving Institutions, through solar energy infrastructure investment. As an integral part of the community, colleges are uniquely positioned to lead the way in solar energy infrastructure investment – lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, and equipping students to become the next generation of clean energy leaders.”

The initiative is also projected to create about 1,900 jobs and generate $137 million in community wealth through shared ownership models. Furthermore, the program will help avoid 3.14 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking roughly 700,000 cars off the road for a year. Eligible higher education institutions are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clean_Energy_Fund_of_Texas_Logo-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 18:09:29.342246

The jury is still out on whether the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped contain or reduce inflation. Nevertheless, certain provisions have delivered tangible benefits that deserve closer examination before any potential repeal. While some provisions may not have broad appeal, one success of the IRA has been its impact on strengthening U.S. energy production. The bill speaks more to renewable energy innovation and increase in energy independence to support U.S. economic growth than to direct economic impact. Repealing it wholesale risks far more than we might anticipate.

At its core, the IRA tax credits for energy generation are driving significant investment in innovative energy production. Because renewable energy makes up around 21.4% of the energy mix, these incentives have been passed down the chain to the benefits of the ratepayer, while simultaneously sustaining the creation of entire industries. These investments have sparked construction and manufacturing jobs across both red and blue states, proving that clean energy isn’t just an environmental initiative.

These tax credits have also bolstered America’s energy independence. Renewables like solar, onshore wind and offshore wind are integral to our domestic energy supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources, and making our own infrastructure more resilient. They’ve also driven initiatives to improve long-term cost competitiveness, incentivizing developers to innovate to reduce costs.

Our current grid infrastructure and energy generation systems are nearing obsolescence and over the next decade the demand on these systems is expected to skyrocket. Data centers alone are expected to double their electricity demand, and by 2035, over 71 million electric vehicles will require around 400 kWh to charge per month. Urbanization trends are compounding this demand as more people move to cities.

Without the IRA tax credits, we risk slowing down our ability to develop more power generation, growing the risk of rolling blackouts and higher energy costs for the average ratepayer, all while increasing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Today’s decisions don’t impact today’s costs, they impact tomorrow’s ability to grow our economy.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the Internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Renewable energy is no exception.

Since the IRA has been enacted, the renewable energy industry has created thousands of jobs and established numerous domestic manufacturing plants on U.S. soil spurred by these domestic supply tax credit incentives. Manufacturing isn’t the only business reaping these benefits either. These credits have helped support better-paying jobs in specialized professions such as those in the maritime industry for offshore wind or wind technician positions.

Energy diversity isn’t just good economics — it’s a good security policy. With a diverse mix of energy sources (nuclear, fuel based, hydro, renewable), we reduce the risk of monopolies that drive up costs, as seen with Standard Oil’s monopoly in the early 20th century. Competition forces developers to lower costs, driving the cost of energy downwards. Furthermore, the energy has to come from somewhere and the question is not about the current costs of renewable energy but the future cost of energy in general to consumers without renewables in the energy mix of the future. There is nothing more damaging than energy you need but can’t find.

From a national security perspective, energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. If one source is cut off, others can fill the gap, ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing our reliance on adversarial nations for critical resources. Not only are we safer from attack, but we are also responsible for our own generation. This further helps reduce costs, but also prevents us from being beholden to other countries, especially our adversaries, for energy and tangential resources such as rare minerals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Hv8PCyQkZi0Q_aXEa5Bbam_cDvRz6BlNQ8WwJzkdND8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEyMTQ2Mzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-30 15:21:20.748405

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, May 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- According to a new study published by Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence, the electric commercial vehicles market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.23% between 2025 and 2030 to reach US$228.202 billion by 2030.

The electric commercial vehicles market is experiencing a significant surge in demand as companies and consumers alike prioritize sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. This trend has been further accelerated by the global push towards clean energy and the need for more environmentally-friendly transportation options.

This growth can be attributed to the increasing government initiatives and regulations promoting the adoption of electric vehicles, as well as the rising awareness among consumers about the environmental impact of traditional fuel-powered vehicles.

One of the key factors driving the growth of the electric commercial vehicles market is the cost savings associated with electric vehicles. With lower maintenance and fuel costs, electric vehicles offer a more cost-effective option for businesses, especially those with large fleets. Additionally, advancements in battery technology have increased the range and performance of electric vehicles, making them a more viable option for commercial use.

The electric commercial vehicles market is also seeing a rise in innovative solutions, such as electric trucks and vans with autonomous capabilities, further enhancing their appeal to businesses. These vehicles not only reduce carbon emissions but also offer increased efficiency and safety on the road.

As the demand for sustainable transportation continues to grow, the electric commercial vehicles market is expected to see even more significant growth in the coming years. With the support of government initiatives and advancements in technology, electric vehicles are becoming a more accessible and practical option for businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint. This shift towards sustainable transportation is a positive step towards a greener and more environmentally-friendly future.

Challenges were filed by Colorado’s Eagle County and several environmental organizations. The Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision that found “numerous [National Environmental Policy Act] NEPA violations arising from the EIS.”1

The 88-Mile Railroad Line

The Board, which reviews applications for new railroad lines, approved a proposal by a group of seven Utah counties (the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition) for the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah. The line would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network and would facilitate the transportation of crude oil from Utah to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere.

The Board’s Extraordinarily Lengthy EIS

The Board prepared what the Court referred to as “an extraordinarily lengthy EIS, spanning more than 3,600 pages of environmental analysis” addressing the environmental effects of the railroad line pursuant to NEPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit faulted the EIS for not sufficiently considering the “environmental effects of projects separate from the railroad line itself.” The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the environmental effects that should have been addressed in the EIS included these separate projects:

Increased oil drilling upstream in the Uinta Basin; and

Increased oil refining downstream along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.

Holding that the agency’s NEPA analysis was flawed, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Board’s EIS and the Board’s approval of the 88-mile railroad line. That decision further delayed the railroad’s construction even though the Board approved the project nearly four years earlier in December 2021.

Substantial Judicial Deference Required in NEPA Cases

Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered the unanimous 8-0 opinion of the Court2 ruling that:

First, the D.C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases.

Second, the D.C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue.

Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so. (Emphasis added.)

Upstream Oil Drilling and Other Speculative Projects Need Not Be Analyzed

The Court ruled that the Board’s decision was correct that analysis of the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling was not needed emphasizing that the project at issue was an “88-mile railroad line, not an oil well or a drilling permit in the Uinta Basin.” (Emphasis added.)

In addition, the Board possesses “no authority or control over potential future oil and gas development” in the Basin. Future projects would be “subject to the approval processes of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.”

The environmental effects of future oil and gas development in the Basin are “speculative” and attenuated from the project at hand.3

NEPA is Purely Procedural – an Agency’s Role – a Court’s Role

Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the need to distinguish the agency’s role from the court’s role. Courts should “defer to agencies’ decisions” about where to draw the line for:

How far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand; and

Whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.

Thus, agencies possess discretion and must have broad latitude to draw a “manageable line.”4

In an attempt to “tie all this together,” Justice Kavanaugh states:

When assessing significant environmental effects and feasible alternatives for purposes of NEPA, an agency will invariably make a series of fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry – and also about the length, content, and level of detail of the resulting EIS.

Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.

As the Court has emphasized on several occasions, and we doubly underscore again today, “inherent in NEPA . . . is a ‘rule of reason,’ which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any new potential information to the decision making process.”5 (Emphasis added.)

Delay Upon Delay – the Process Seems to “Border on the Kafkaesque.”

The Court’s critique of the history of NEPA implementation will perhaps reign in the extremes that project proponents have witnessed since President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970 – over 56 years ago. In his review, Justice Kavanaugh criticizes the tendency for agencies to engage in analysis of separate projects that address:

more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation. (Emphasis added.)

He cites the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Vermont Yankee: “Delay upon delay, so much so that the process sometimes seems to “borde[r] on the Kafkaesque.”6

And further:

A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development “under the guise” of just a little more process. . . .

A course correction of sorts is appropriate to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense. . . .

Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects.

On the contrary, as this Court has stressed, courts should and “must defer to ‘the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.’”7

The D.C. Circuit Was Wrong on the Merits of NEPA

Beyond requiring that courts defer to the informed discretion of the agency, the majority then addresses the failings of the D.C. Circuit Court’s rulings on the merits under NEPA stating:

The D.C. Circuit erroneously required the Board to address environmental effects from projects that are separate in time or place from the 88-mile railroad project at hand – that is, effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects. Moreover, those separate projects fall outside the Board’s authority and would be initiated, if at all, by third parties.

And to ensure that the reader understands the value of footnotes in the Court decision, footnote 5 deserves particular consideration:

Even though not mandated by NEPA to do so, the Board did identify some of the potential effects and marginal risks from projects separate from the 88 miles of additional railroad track in rural Utah. See, e.g., App. 354-358 (forecasting the number of oil wells that could be added in the Uinta Basin as a result of increased production spurred by the new railway); id., at 420-423, 539-542 (evaluating effects from increased oil refining along the Gulf Coast).

The Board should not necessarily earn bonus points for studying more than NEPA demanded. But it should definitely not receive a failing grade just because its 3,600-page EIS was less thorough in analyzing the effects from other projects than the Court of Appeals might have preferred. (Emphasis added.)

In summary:

The proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward. Courts should review an agency’s EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand.

The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.

In conducting that review, courts should afford substantial deference to the agency as to the scope and contents of the EIS.

The Sotomayor Concurrence – the Agency’s Organic Statute and Case Precedent Control

Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her concurring opinion that took a different approach to reach the same conclusion as the majority. The concurring Justices relied on (1) the organic statute pursuant to which the agency acts (here the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, 49 U.S.C. §11101) and (2) earlier Court precedent. Agreeing that the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision was wrong, Justice Sotomayor states:

[U]nder its organic statute, the Board had no authority to reject petitioners’ application on account of the harms third parties would cause with products transported on the proposed railway. The majority takes a different path, unnecessarily grounding its analysis largely in matters of policy.

Justice Sotomayor reviewed the Board’s organic statute and confirmed the Board’s understanding of the scope of its review and the factors the Board must address in reviewing applications by project proponents stating:

As common carriers, railroads subject to the Board’s jurisdiction are required to provide ‘transportation or service on reasonable request’ to any person or commodity.” (49 U.S.C. §11101(a)). In addition, the Act contains a clear presumption in favor of approving new railways.

And of the 15 statutory policies the Board must consider in the exemption process, not one concerns the anticipated use of commodities that will be transported on the proposed railway. See §§10101(1)-(15).

Unlike the Board, meanwhile, other entities do have authority “to approve oil and gas development projects” and to regulate the effects of refining. . . . All this suggests, as the Board concluded, that the Board could not have rejected petitioners’ application in order to prevent the harmful effects of oil drilling and refining.

But the environmental respondents, although conceding that the Board correctly understood its authority to approve or disapprove a project application, argued that the Board should have analyzed environmental impacts that the Board could not lawfully prevent. Justice Sotomayor provided an unsympathetic dismissal of that argument concluding:

Public Citizen squarely forecloses that position. . . . Even a foreseeable environmental effect is outside of NEPA’s scope if the agency could not lawfully decide to modify or reject the proposed action on account of it. NEPA thus did not require the Board to consider the effects of oil drilling and refining.

Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible. Here, the Board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the Railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process. For that reason, I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the D.C. Circuit’s holding requiring the Board to consider in further detail harms caused by the oil industry.

Cumulative Impacts or Effects?

Those of us in the midst of dealing with federal agencies and those agencies’ NEPA obligations related to our projects will search in vain for any reference in either the majority or concurring opinions for any reference to “cumulative impacts” or “cumulative effects.” So, will a review of the Seven County decision at least indirectly provide some useful guidance? Maybe.

The NEPA statute itself does not use the terms “indirect” or “cumulative impacts or effects.” However, it has been generally understood for over 50 years that NEPA’s requirement that an EIS should discuss “the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” implies that the scope of an EIS is meant not only to consider the immediate effects of a project but also how a project might impact the environment in the long-term through indirect or cumulative effects with other projects.

Although NEPA does not use the terms explicitly, the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) were the first to address federal agency responsibility to consider indirect and cumulative impacts and to document that analysis.8

And despite recent court decisions and the Trump Administration’s actions that eliminate the CEQ rules9, every federal agency (including the Surface Transportation Board) has promulgated their own NEPA regulations that require analysis of direct and indirect impacts in their environmental reviews.10

Consider the discussion above as a prelude to our interest in reviewing the Seven County decision to find further guidance as to whether and how federal agencies will now address “cumulative impacts” of our projects. The underlying facts of the case might appear to automatically involve the need to assess cumulative environmental impacts of constructing and operating a new rail line – impacts beyond “just” the rail line itself.

Indeed, what is the “need” for the rail line? The answer: oil development! Without the need to transport oil to the “main rail lines” and distant refineries, there is no need for the line. So, how does one disengage the impacts of one from the impacts of the other?

That’s exactly what the opponents of the rail line argued. For example, the Brief of Respondents Eagle County, Colorado and Center for Biological Diversity, et al in Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari states in part:

Limiting agencies to effects that they directly regulate, rather than effects Congress has authorized them to consider, does not comport with NEPA’s purpose or rule of reason – “that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any potential information in the decision-making process.”

Both the majority and concurring opinions limit the agency’s obligation, however, to a review of the application of the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition for an 88-mile railroad – not the arguably “cumulative impacts” and “indirect impacts” that might occur with further oil and gas development in the Uinta Basin. And it is the underlying “organic statute” that provides the authority for this particular agency to do anything that drives the result.

In sum, these are the factors that we, our project proponents, and the federal agencies involved must consider.

Has the federal agency undertaking the NEPA analysis acted within the scope of authority Congress provided in its “organic” statute?

Has the agency incorrectly considered projects that are separate in time or place from the proposed project?

Because the textual focus of NEPA is the “proposed action” – the project at hand – not other separate projects, has the agency gone too far in addressing those separate projects?

Has the agency addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives to the relevant project?

Is the agency’s final decision reasonably explained?

And finally, while indirect environmental effects of the project may fall within NEPA’s scope (even if they might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or materialize later in time), the fact that the project might foreseeably lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project does not mean the agency must consider that separate project’s environmental effects.

Among the 24 axed awards was a hydrogen energy initiative led by Exxon Mobil in Baytown, Texas, and several decarbonization projects for the cement sector and for the food and beverage industry, including the Kraft Heinz Co.

Of the canceled grants, only $99 million had gone out the door, DOE said. The majority of the contracts were signed by the Biden DOE after Donald Trump won the presidency last November, the department said.

DOE’s list shows award cancellations for projects that are mostly in Republican-leaning states — Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, Ohio and Alabama — and for industries that have voiced support for Trump.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

He added, “the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars.”

The department says it used a review process announced earlier this month to cancel the awards, deciding the grants “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment.”

Democratic lawmakers, environmentalists, energy efficiency groups and some manufacturing advocates panned the grant cancellations.

“We’re ceding ground to global competitors racing ahead in innovation and energy efficiency,” Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said in a statement.

“The American people deserve leadership that meets the moment — not one that backs away from the challenge of a clean, affordable energy future. If the Trump Administration was looking to give Communist China everything they wanted, they are well on their way,” said Kaptur, the ranking member of the House Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over DOE.

The largest canceled awards are for carbon capture projects at cement plants. Heidelberg Materials received $500 million for a project, and the National Cement Co. of California won an award for the same amount.

An $189 million award for cement company Brimstone Energy was also canceled. Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin said the company believes the decision to cancel was based on a “misunderstanding,” given the “project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.”

“Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Darwin said in a statement.

Erin Glabets, spokesperson for Sublime Systems, which had an $87 million cement grant canceled, said the company was “surprised and disappointed.”

Heidelberg Materials spokesperson David Perkins said in an interview, “DOE indicates this decision can be appealed.”

“We are in the process of evaluating this course as we consider our next steps,” he said.

Meanwhile, natural gas plants appear to be big targets for the cancellations.

Among DOE’s award cancellations is one for a gas-fired power plant in Kentucky, which DOE selected last February for a federal cost share of $72 million. The Cane Run Generating Station intended to install CCS and trap roughly 200 tons of carbon dioxide per day.

Power generator Calpine and its carbon capture projects also took a hit. On the list of cancellations was a $270 million award to Calpine Texas CCUS Holdings for the company’s project in Baytown, Texas.

A $332 million canceled award for Exxon Mobil was for a project that planned to swap out natural gas for hydrogen at a textile and plastic production site in Baytown. At the time of the Biden award announcement, DOE said the project would avoid 2.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, along with roughly 200 tons per year of nitrogen oxide.

Exxon declined to comment.

Another axed award, for just over $49 million, was headed to a carbon capture pilot at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, which is outside of the Dry Fork power station in Gillette, Wyoming. That award was also announced in February 2024.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition — a group that works to build policy support for greater deployment of carbon management technologies — said DOE’s decision to cancel awards is “hugely disappointing.”

“Businesses require certainty to plan and execute projects, and carbon management is no different,” Stolark said in a statement. “For decades, the United States has been the global leader in the development and deployment of carbon management technologies but moves like this risk ceding America’s energy and technological leadership to other nations. As the policy framework in other nations for carbon management continues to mature, we risk being left behind.”

Trump has pledged to revive American manufacturing with a sweeping package of import tariffs. Tariffs implemented under the president’s declared emergency last month are now stuck in a legal limbo, after a federal court decision Wednesday striking down the levies was followed by an appeals court allowing the tariffs to stay in place while appeals play out.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said of the canceled DOE awards. “Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”

Nadel called the DOE decision “shortsighted.”

EPA promotes carbon capture

DOE’s award terminations contrast with EPA efforts to speed up permitting of wells used to sequester heat-trapping carbon dioxide deep into underground formations.

Earlier this year, EPA granted top regulatory authority over Class VI wells, to the state of West Virginia. It also recently proposed granting that authority — called “primacy” — to Arizona for all six classes of injection wells, including Class VI.

“EPA received a complete Class VI primacy application from Texas on February 28, 2025,” EPA spokesperson Carolyn Holran said in a statement Thursday.

The agency “is working expeditiously to propose and then finalize this rulemaking. EPA’s goal is to support a timely and efficient primacy decision that protects groundwater resources and supports cooperative federalism,” Holran said.

The list didn’t include some of the largest projects — such as hydrogen hubs — potentially slated for cancellation at DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, according to documents that have been circulating among DOE officials and lobbyists for weeks.

It’s possible that those other projects may be terminated later, as Wright has said DOE is conducting a broad review of projects to be completed this summer. According to the documents, four of seven hydrogen hubs funded with $7 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law may be on the chopping block.

The 24 projects nixed Friday were on the circulating lists.

OCED also is facing a staffing plunge. More than 70 percent of employees have opted to leave the office voluntarily as part of a deferred resignation program. The department has not provided a final tally of how many resignation offers have been approved.

According to modeling from the environmental think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the closure of OCED could result in the loss of more than 290,000 jobs.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/63/ae/f154bca745c494039412b11694bc/senate-energy-82284.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:23:43.684849

Businesses have canceled or delayed some $14-billion worth of clean energy projects just since January, alongside some 10,000 announced jobs, according to a new analysis by business and advocacy group E2. Furthermore, if Trump’s tax and spending bill passes into law, E2 anticipates steeper losses.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” E2 communications director Michael Timberlake said in a statement.

E2 tracks private investments and job creation that have been announced in the clean energy industry since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The organization tallies projects in manufacturing, R&D, and electricity generation, as well as recycling, repair, and maintenance projects. Sectors E2 follows include batteries, EVs, hydrogen, semiconductors, solar, and wind. Since the bill’s 2022 passage, E2 notes some 390 projects, worth some $132 billion, have been announced, along with roughly 123,000 jobs.

E2 notes that Republican-run congressional districts have reaped the majority of benefits: 61 percent of projects, 72 percent of jobs, and 82 percent of investment. As a result, Republican districts are also taking a majority of the losses, to the tune of some $12 billion in project cancellations and 13,000 canceled jobs.

Some Republican lawmakers have begun sounding the alarm on the version of Trump’s bill that passed the House, which restricts the ability for clean energy producers of wind and solar to access credits but carves out exceptions for nuclear power, Politico reported last week. Five Senate Republicans told Politico they plan to consider changes to the House’s version of the bill, with Finance Committee member Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) saying, “Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Trump’s former top adviser, Elon Musk, has similarly expressed distaste with provisions in the bill that would at the close of the year terminate EV incentives worth up to $7,500—including for Tesla models. It’s a change in tune for the Tesla CEO, who previously seemed to endorse erasure of the incentives as beneficial to Tesla. Musk announced his official departure from White House duties on Wednesday.

Tesla’s energy division, which sells solar supplies and battery storage, is similarly at risk from the planned repeal of residential solar credits and phaseout of clean energy investment incentives.

Commenting on an X user’s post that referred to the bill’s removal of solar energy credits as “unjust,” Musk wrote, “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

Musk also shared a post from Tesla Energy, urging the Senate “to enact legislation with a sensible wind down” of credits for residential solar and low carbon electricity, rather than “abruptly ending the energy tax credits” in order to support grid integrity, domestic manufacturing, and AI.

What could change, however, is the permitting process for fossil fuel projects. The current version of Trump’s bill contains provisions seeking to streamline and expedite that process, Politico reported, but that component may not make it through the Senate.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/05/trump-cuts-climate-tech-projects-inc.jpg",N,,2025-05-30 16:09:58.281386

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds.

Elegant, advanced interior

The interior is roomy and comfortable, with materials including carbon fiber, open-pore wood. Highlights include metal inlays in wood trim, ambient lighting and woven accent fabric made from recycled feedstock. The 23-speaker audio system has jewel-pattern metal grilles.

The instrument panel has 33 inches of continuous screen for displays and controls ― and eventually to stream videos when parked and charging. A separate touch screen handles climate, infotainment and other features, including apps from the Google Play store.

There’s useful luggage and cargo room. The third row of seats provides adult legroom when the second row is moved forward.

What could be better?

The touch screen is not responsive enough for some functions, including adjusting lumber support and other seat features.

Polarized sunglasses significantly reduce the augmented reality display’s visibility.

While GM makes third-party apps available through its Google operating system and adopts other Android smart phone features, the automaker’s EVs don’t allow Apple CarPlay, complicating some drivers’ accustomed smart phone use.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?

The Vistiq’s broad stance, vertical lights and illuminated badges stand out. Like the Escalade ― like all Cadillacs should ― the SUV announces your arrival. It’s responsive on the road and in parking lots, thanks to well-tuned steering and suspension. The interior is elegant, roomy and easy to use, with contemporary touches like metal-inlaid wood, fabric from recycled materials, and large and legible displays.

Advanced technologies improve everything from driving to enjoying music and flowing navigation instructions.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds.

Elegant, advanced interior

The interior is roomy and comfortable, with materials including carbon fiber, open-pore wood. Highlights include metal inlays in wood trim, ambient lighting and woven accent fabric made from recycled feedstock. The 23-speaker audio system has jewel-pattern metal grilles.

The instrument panel has 33 inches of continuous screen for displays and controls ― and eventually to stream videos when parked and charging. A separate touch screen handles climate, infotainment and other features, including apps from the Google Play store.

There’s useful luggage and cargo room. The third row of seats provides adult legroom when the second row is moved forward.

What could be better?

The touch screen is not responsive enough for some functions, including adjusting lumber support and other seat features.

Polarized sunglasses significantly reduce the augmented reality display’s visibility.

While GM makes third-party apps available through its Google operating system and adopts other Android smart phone features, the automaker’s EVs don’t allow Apple CarPlay, complicating some drivers’ accustomed smart phone use.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?

The Vistiq’s broad stance, vertical lights and illuminated badges stand out. Like the Escalade ― like all Cadillacs should ― the SUV announces your arrival. It’s responsive on the road and in parking lots, thanks to well-tuned steering and suspension. The interior is elegant, roomy and easy to use, with contemporary touches like metal-inlaid wood, fabric from recycled materials, and large and legible displays.

Advanced technologies improve everything from driving to enjoying music and flowing navigation instructions.

The order set off a panicked evacuation of staff and patients at the Al-Awda Hospital, which was the last functioning hospital in the region. Health officials say Israeli attacks on hospitals have killed more than 1,400 medical workers since October 2023.

On Thursday, Israeli attacks across Gaza killed at least 70 Palestinians; airstrikes since dawn today have killed a further 18 people, according to Gaza hospital officials. Al Jazeera reports Israeli troops shot and wounded 20 Palestinians trying to reach an aid distribution point set up by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. It’s the third aid center set up by the group so far. The United Nations has said the foundation’s decision to open a handful of aid hubs exclusively in the south of the Gaza Strip puts civilian lives in danger and encourages mass displacement by using aid as “bait.”

Gaza’s food crisis continues to worsen, as the trickle of aid now entering the territory is far too little for its population of over 2 million people. This is Khawla Abu Zeitar, mother of an 11-month-old child suffering from malnutrition, who said she did not manage to get a meal after waiting in line at a soup kitchen in Gaza City Wednesday.

Khawla Abu Zeitar: “This boy is suffering from extreme malnutrition. … The average weight for his age is 12 kilograms. Now he only weighs 3.9 kilograms. He has been granted a medical evacuation 20 days ago, but I’m still waiting.”

On Thursday, the White House said Israel had agreed to a U.S.-crafted Gaza ceasefire proposal and that Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had submitted it to Hamas. Drop Site News reports the deal includes a 60-day initial truce, a “redeployment” of some Israeli occupation forces, and an exchange of captives, including 10 living Israelis held in Gaza. It would also require the “immediate” delivery of humanitarian aid, including by the United Nations and the Red Crescent. Hamas officials said they were studying the deal, but a member of the group’s political bureau told Reuters the proposal in its current form would result in “the continuation of killing and famine” in Gaza.

Saudi Arabia’s defense minister warned leaders of Iran last month that they should accept President Trump’s offer to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with the U.S. — or face military action by Israel. That’s according to Reuters, which reports Saudi Prince Khalid bin Salman personally delivered the message that Trump’s team would want to reach a deal quickly, that the window for diplomacy would close fast, and that an Israeli attack was possible if the talks broke down. Khalid bin Salman’s visit to Iran in April was the first by a high-ranking member of the Saudi royal family in more than two decades.

A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily reinstated Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, staying a decision by a trade court that had blocked those tariffs one day earlier after finding Trump overstepped presidential authority by invoking emergency powers. Prior to Thursday’s stay, another federal court, this time in Washington, D.C., had also blocked Trump’s tariffs. The case is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court. Trump’s trade war has roiled global markets and already cost companies $34 billion, according to Reuters. A number of smaller businesses have been forced to shutter. We’ll have more on this story with the Brennan Center’s Elizabeth Goitein later in the broadcast.

The founder of the private mercenary firm Blackwater is working with Haiti’s interim government on a plan to conduct lethal operations against the gangs that now control much of Haiti’s territory. The New York Times reports Erik Prince recently shipped a large supply of weapons to Haiti and is planning to send up to 150 mercenaries there this summer. Prince is reportedly part of a secret task force that has spent the past several weeks operating drones meant to kill gang members. A Haitian human rights group blames the drones for the deaths of over 200 people.

The daughter of a woman who died during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave is suing seven oil and gas companies for her mother’s wrongful death. Juliana Leon died of hyperthermia, or overheating, as a “heat dome” choked the region and sent temperatures in Seattle skyrocketing to 108 degrees. Nearly 200 people died during the heat wave. The lawsuit is the first of its kind and accuses the fossil fuel companies of concealing their role in creating the climate crisis and failing to warn people of the dangers of their emissions.

This comes as a new report today found half the world population endured 30 additional days of extreme heat over the past year due to human-created climate change.

The Supreme Court has sharply limited the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, a ruling that will accelerate the development of major infrastructure projects including highways, pipelines and liquefied natural gas export terminals. The court’s 8-0 ruling on Thursday will allow federal agencies conducting environmental reviews to take a more limited view of the impacts of major transportation and energy projects. Earthjustice said in a statement, “The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.”

A court in Germany ruled against a Peruvian farmer who was seeking redress from the energy company RWE for its role in the melting of Andean glaciers, which has put the farmer and his community in Huaraz at risk of flooding. But climate activists are celebrating the ruling as a major victory, as the German court also found major polluters can be held responsible for the consequences of climate change, setting up a possible precedent as similar cases play out in other countries. This is German lawyer Roda Verheyen, who represented Saúl Luciano Lliuya in the landmark case.

Roda Verheyen: “But what is important is the legal obligation of companies like RWE has been established here today. The legal obligation to deal with the consequences of their actions and to bear responsibility for them is something that has never before been established anywhere in the world in this form.”

A major report on chronic health conditions by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was found to contain citations to nonexistent studies. According to the outlet NOTUS, the 73-page “Make America Healthy Again” document contains references to at least seven fabricated studies, while other studies are misinterpreted.

This comes as the Health Department has just canceled a $600 million contract with Moderna to develop mRNA vaccines protecting against flu subtypes which could develop into pandemics, including bird flu. RFK Jr. has expressed skepticism over mRNA technology, which was used in COVID vaccines that are widely credited with saving millions of lives and preventing millions of cases of severe disease.

Here in New York, a judge extended a temporary restraining order protecting Columbia University student Yunseo Chung from deportation until a hearing on June 5. Chung, a South Korean national, is a green card holder who has lived in the U.S. since she was 7. She’s been targeted by immigration authorities for participating in Palestinian rights protests at Columbia. Community members rallied in support of Chung as her lawyers appeared in court Thursday. This is Yunmi from the group Nodutdol.

Yunmi: “She’s being attacked because she has views that go against the Trump administration and their desires in Israel and also against the general ruling class. So, by persecuting her on also baseless grounds — there’s no evidence against her — who can say what the Trump administration and the federal government are willing to do next to anyone, regardless of their immigration status?”

The renowned Kenyan author, playwright and professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has died at the age of 87. Over six decades, he chronicled Kenya’s transition from a British colony to independence. Thiong’o’s work landed him in jail and in exile as he wrote searing criticisms of colonial rule, as well as the emerging independent state, which he accused of benefiting elites at the expense of Kenyan society. In 2010, Democracy Now! interviewed him in our studio after he’d just released his memoir, “Dreams in a Time of War.”

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: “In all the settler colonies, like Kenya, Nigeria — not Nigeria — Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe — Mozambique is another example, Algeria is another example — independence was won through armed struggle. In all of those, there was armed liberation movements, and the land question was at the basis of the whole struggle. So, with Kenya, we had one of the earliest anti-colonial guerrilla movements. Ours was by the name of Mau Mau.”

While BEVs use charged battery packs, hydrogen fuel cell EVs generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The only byproducts are water vapor and warm air, making them a zero-emission alternative to gas-powered cars.

Instead of a lithium-ion battery pack, hydrogen cars rely on electricity from the hydrogen-oxygen reaction to power their motors. However, hydrogen vehicles still face major hurdles before achieving mass adoption. Toyota is the only automaker to make a notable investment in them, though its efforts haven’t gained much traction in the market.

Most automakers prioritized BEVs, and many drivers haven’t heard of hydrogen-powered vehicles or the environmental benefits they offer. Furthermore, hydrogen cars have yet to prove their effectiveness compared to BEVs and gas-powered vehicles.

Still, many auto industry leaders believe hydrogen technology could play a key role in long-haul transport and certain commercial applications. Toyota emphasizes that hydrogen cars serve specific needs. According to the company’s Mobility Communication Consultant Josh Burns, a customer’s budget, lifestyle, and available infrastructure will determine whether hydrogen or battery electric makes more sense.

Though hydrogen cars emit no pollutants, their sustainability depends on how the hydrogen is produced. Clean hydrogen, derived from renewable sources, is essential if hydrogen vehicles are to be considered truly green.

One of the biggest upsides of hydrogen vehicles is convenience. Refueling takes as little as five minutes, much faster than charging most BEVs, and the process is just as easy as filling up a gas tank. Hydrogen cars also offer more consistent performance over time since they don’t rely on batteries that degrade with age.

A typical hydrogen vehicle can travel around 400 miles on a single tank, comparable to or better than many electric cars. However, hydrogen fuel is more expensive than gasoline or electricity, and the limited number of refueling stations restricts where these vehicles can realistically operate.

Because of this, hydrogen car owners must plan their routes carefully. Drivers outside areas with hydrogen infrastructure, mostly in California, Japan, and a few parts of Europe, simply don’t have the option of owning one.

While hydrogen fuel cell vehicles remain a niche market today, their fast refueling, long range, and zero emissions keep them in the conversation about the future of clean transportation, especially for uses where battery electric vehicles may fall short.

As HFCEV technology is further developed, it will have to prove itself against competition from fossil-fueled vehicles and EVs from various manufacturers like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO).

GM originally estimated 440 miles of range for the 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, but real-world tests yielded over 500 miles on a charge. That's not bad for an 8,800-pound truck on 24-inch wheels in normal driving conditions. Now, the 2026 model is coming around, and GMC has released the EPA estimated range figures for its Max Range versions of the Sierra EV trims. If you buy the right trim, you can get up to 478 miles of range. Not in a slickly aerodynamic Lucid Air sedan. In a full-size pickup truck.

Quietly Becoming The Class Leader

It seems that the Sierra EV hasn't had a lot of headlines despite having a reasonable entry price of $64,495 and a brutal amount of power available with the range – up to 760 horsepower (Denali Max Range) with 785 lb-ft of torque. Now, GMC is happy to show off the Sierra's 2026 EPA-estimated long-range numbers (the Max Range option), and it opens with the Sierra EV Elevation boasting 410 miles. However, the Sierra EV AT4 and Sierra EV Denali are showing off an estimated 478 miles of range – 38 miles more than the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 that impressed so much and 18 miles more than the Denali's maximum for 2025.

With a GM-estimated 478 miles of range, the Sierra EV AT4 with available Max Range can travel from Los Angeles to Phoenix, San Francisco to Santa Barbara or New York City to Virginia Beach on a full charge. This surpasses the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck to stand out in the all-electric truck market.

– GMC

As you can see above, GMC isn't afraid of throwing some shade at Ford, Rivian, and Tesla over this. In reality, going so nuts for range doesn't make a huge amount of logical sense. Most people don't travel more than an average of 40 miles a day, although work trucks can easily average a hundred miles a day. While people will occasionally make 400-mile journeys, that's an awful lot of battery to carry around daily for those occasions. However, range anxiety isn't logical, but it is very real, and getting caught on a journey with no chargers around or only broken chargers isn't fun.

A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

A lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. ""Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,"" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. ""The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Boutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

The Permitting Technology Action Plan provides a government-wide strategy to optimize technology to effectively and efficiently evaluate environmental permits, allowing for seamless information exchange between agencies, simplified interactions for applicants, and greater transparency and predictability on environmental review and permitting schedules for sponsors and stakeholders.

The Permitting Technology Action Plan contains:

Minimum functional requirements for environmental review and permitting systems;

An initial National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and permitting data and technology standard;

A timeline and implementation roadmap for agencies; and

A governance structure for implementation.

This Permitting Technology Action Plan is a testament to the Trump Administration’s commitment to expediting and simplifying the environmental review and permitting process. It delivers on President Trump’s Memorandum, Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century, and follows the establishment of the Permitting Innovation Center. Working with the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, the CEQ-led Permitting Innovation Center will design and test prototype permitting technology systems in order to advise Federal agencies on the adoption of the best-in-class-tools.

“The Trump Administration is working tirelessly to implement innovation-driven environmental review and permitting reforms to eliminate needless delays that cripple the growth of the U.S. economy, replacing outdated technology with efficient, speedier solutions,” said Katherine Scarlett, Chief of Staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through interagency coordination, this Administration has taken bold action to streamline the NEPA process and get America back to building infrastructure projects of all kinds.”

“Under President Trump’s leadership, we will ensure the Federal government is maximizing modern technologies to streamline permitting,” said Thomas Shedd, Technology Transformation Services Director at the General Services Administration. “Technology Transformation Services remains committed to supporting the execution of the Permitting Technology Action Plan by building the tools agencies can use to accelerate their environmental review and permitting processes – with results in weeks or months, not years.”

The solutions laid out in the Permitting Technology Action Plan will leverage technology to tackle longstanding problems identified in CEQ’s E-NEPA Report to Congress—including, reliance on outdated systems, fragmented data management, and disconnected digital tools—reinforcing this Administration’s unwavering dedication to deliver outstanding results at 21st century speeds.

In Case You Missed It: President Trump Unleashes Permitting Technology for the 21st Century

“We need to drill more, map more, mine more, and build more — all while innovating faster than our global competitors,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The Permitting Technology Action Plan will channel our greatest asset, American innovation and technology, to overhaul our current permitting process and power our nation faster, better, cleaner, and more reliably than ever before. Embracing cutting-edge development and modernizing this outdated system will pave the way to American success.”

“With President Trump’s leadership, this administration is taking action to fix a broken system that’s slowing down critical energy projects across the country. Outdated permitting systems are creating costly delays at the exact moment we need to be expanding capacity, strengthening our energy security, and building the infrastructure that powers American industry and lowers costs for families,” said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “As Secretary of Energy and Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, I welcome this decisive action to modernize permitting technology, cut red tape, and align the full force of the federal government behind getting these essential projects approved and built—because energy dominance isn’t possible without the infrastructure to support it.”

“When President Trump says American farmers and ranchers have been the lifeblood of our economy for centuries, he means it. For too long, our producers have experienced delays and uncertainty as they navigate a complex permitting process that gets in the way of American innovation and stifles energy and timber production. This historic Memorandum will increase efficiency and transparency so farmers, foresters, and producers can get back to the work they do every day to feed, fuel, and clothe our nation,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

“It takes too long to build in America,” said Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy. “Ridiculous red tape and outdated regulations add cost and delays to projects. It has to stop. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are slashing the bureaucracy and getting back to actually building things in America again. We are doing that by harnessing innovative technology to expedite the permitting process.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:28:38.203682

Over the past few months, the Texas Senate passed three bills that could’ve devastated the state’s nation-leading renewable energy rollout — but clean energy appears to have dodged the bullet.

The first of those bills would establish new fees, setback requirements, and other permitting regulations on utility-scale wind and solar development, even though fossil-fuel plants don’t face the same restrictions. The second would require large renewables installations to buy gas generation as a backup.

And the third would ensure all renewable power development came with a side of fossil fuels, as it directed that 50% of all new power plant capacity added to the state’s grid come from dispatchable resources other than battery storage. That would have amounted to a gas mandate: Since solar panels and wind turbines can only produce power under certain conditions (sun shining, wind blowing, you know the drill), they can only be dispatchable power sources if batteries are involved. An earlier version of the bill explicitly said 50% of new capacity would have to come from gas.

These bills would have seriously slowed Texas’ deployment of solar, batteries, and wind power, which are shattering power-generation records in the state and helping its grid withstand extreme weather and meet surging electricity demand. The legislation would have caused reliability to fall and utility bills to soar, according to an April report from Aurora Energy Research.

But the Texas House’s session is set to end on June 2, and none of those three bills have been scheduled for consideration. This doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t resurface at some point, but they’re at least dead as standalone bills for this session, Doug Lewin writes in his Texas Energy and Power newsletter.

There are growing signs that these sorts of restrictions on renewables aren’t popular among many Texas Republicans and business interests. Recent polling from Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation shows widespread Republican support for renewables, while even the Texas Oil and Gas Association allied with renewable power generators to oppose the state House’s companion to the Senate’s bill requiring gas backup for clean energy.

Similar efforts in the state were defeated two years ago as well.

More big energy stories

DOE orders a coal plant to stay open

The Trump administration took its pro-coal agenda to a new level last Friday, ordering a retiring Michigan coal plant to stay open through at least the end of August. The J.H. Campbell plant was supposed to shut down tomorrow, and Michigan utility Consumers Energy had been working since at least 2021 to do so. But the administration contended that the Midwest faces an ​“energy emergency” and needs the plant to guarantee power reliability.

Clean energy advocates, consumer watchdogs, and even Michigan’s top energy regulator disagree. ​“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps said in a statement. ​“The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses across the Midwest.”

Trump’s nuclear orders probably won’t outweigh cuts

President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders late last week to boost nuclear power — though they probably won’t counteract his many moves to weaken the industry. The four orders will:

Expedite nuclear reactor testing at federal labs, with a goal of approving three new designs by next year.

Slash regulations for building nuclear reactors on federal lands.

Speed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s reviews of reactor licenses.

Boost uranium mining and enrichment.

But in recent months, the Trump administration has also looked to reduce funding for the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, and cut staff at the Loan Programs Office, even though it funds nuclear reactor projects. And though nuclear made out better than other low-carbon energy sources in the federal budget bill recently passed by the House, projects would only be eligible for tax credits if they start construction by 2028 — an ambitious timeline for a famously slow-to-build energy source. Those are big setbacks that won’t ​“magically be solved” by simply cutting red tape, Josh Freed, who heads the climate and energy program at that think tank Third Way, told Latitude Media.

The Detroit District is inviting the public and concerned parties to participate in a 30-day public comment period, which runs from May 30 to June 30, 2025. Comments can be submitted through several methods, including the , virtual public meetings, and written submissions.

Virtual public meetings are scheduled for Wednesday, June 18, 2025, from 1 to 4 p.m., and Wednesday, June 25, 2025, from 5 to 8 p.m. Written comments must be postmarked by June 30, 2025, and sent to Line 5 Tunnel EIS, 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

""Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,"" Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains ""an existential threat.""

""Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,"" the group said. ""We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.""

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

""My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it's prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",https://upnorthlive.com/resources/media/8217bf83-a363-4529-bfee-c5cac914dd5b-large16x9_thumb_17691.png?1668125502821,N,,2025-05-30 17:09:42.822206

Before construction could begin, however, Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups filed suit, challenging the STB's approval.
In an 8–0 decision on Thursday (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case), the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling.
Since its passage in 1969, NEPA has been weaponized by environmental groups to stunt disfavored projects—which has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects.
The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Utah railroad project on Thursday, setting a precedent that could make it easier to build things in the United States.

The case at hand—Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County—involved an 88-mile-long railroad track in an oil-rich and rural area of Utah. The project would have connected this area to the national rail network, making it easier and more efficient to transport crude oil extracted in the region to refineries in Gulf Coast states.

In 2020, a group of seven Utah counties known as the Seven Counties Infrastructure Coalition submitted its application to the federal Surface Transportation Board (STB) for the project. During its review process, the board conducted six public meetings and collected over 1,900 comments to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS)—which is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—that spanned over 3,600 pages. The board approved the project's construction in 2021.

Before construction could begin, however, Eagle County, Colorado, and several environmental groups filed suit, challenging the STB's approval. Specifically, this coalition argued that the STB did not consider the downstream environmental effects of the project—such as increased oil drilling in Utah and refining in the Gulf Coast. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs and vacated the railroad's construction approval.

In an 8–0 decision on Thursday (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case), the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling.

In its majority opinion, authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Court clarified that under NEPA the STB ""did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects."" The Court concluded that the ""proper judicial approach for NEPA cases is straightforward: Courts should review an agency's EIS to check that it addresses the environmental effects of the project at hand. The EIS need not address the effects of separate projects.""

This statement ""is particularly significant for infrastructure projects, such as pipelines or transmission lines, and should help reduce NEPA's burdens (at least at the margins),"" wrote Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, in The Volokh Conspiracy. ""The opinion will also likely hamper any future efforts, perhaps by Democratic administrations, to expand or restore more fulsome (and burdensome) NEPA requirements.""

One recent example is former President Joe Biden, who finalized rules requiring federal agencies to consider a project's impacts on climate change—a global issue that is incredibly complex and hard to forecast—in their NEPA analyses. The Trump administration recently rescinded this requirement.

Kavanaugh's opinion also clarified that courts should ""afford substantial deference"" to federal agencies in their EIS reviews and ""should not micromanage"" agency choices ""so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

This point could reduce one of the largest delays caused by NEPA: litigation. Since its passage in 1969, NEPA has been weaponized by environmental groups to stunt disfavored projects—which has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects. On average, these challenges delay a permitted project's start time by 4.2 years, according to The Breakthrough Institute.

The increased threat of litigation has forced federal agencies to better cover their bases, leading to longer and more expensive environmental reviews. With courts deferring more to agency decisions, litigation could be settled more quickly.

""NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,"" wrote Kavanaugh. ""All of that has led to more agency analysis of separate projects, more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/02/dreamstime_l_12184614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 15:22:52.726322

The Stellantis NV brand showed off the exterior of the new-look Cherokee for the first time Thursday in several images and a video. Long a best-seller for Jeep, the new model has a more boxy appearance than the prior generation. It will also come with a traditional hybrid gas-electric option that the brand hasn't offered before. Until now, Jeep has been focused on its plug-in hybrid offerings and early this year released its first all-electric SUV, the Wagoneer S.

Jeep said the SUV is set to arrive late in 2025 after executives initially had stated it was expected midway through the year. The prior generation of Cherokee ran from model year 2014 until it ended production at the automaker's Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois in early 2023.

""Jeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream lineup,"" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement.

Dealers have eagerly awaited the new Cherokee and expressed frustration that the company didn't fill the lineup gap sooner. The Cherokee historically sold in large numbers — sometimes over 200,000 units a year in the United States over the past decade — and the midsize SUV segment in general is highly popular among American consumers.

In terms of pricing, the new Cherokee will sit somewhere between the entry-level Compass, which starts below $30,000, and the larger and more luxurious Grand Cherokee, with a starting price under $40,000.

The new Cherokee is expected to be built at the automaker's Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions LLC. That is also where the electric Wagoneer S is made, and it also is expected to eventually manufacture a third midsize Jeep SUV, the electric Recon, which is also set to come out in late 2025.

The Cherokee, like the other SUVs coming from Toluca, will be built on the STLA Large platform, a vehicle underpinning that Stellantis has said allows it to offer a range of options, from gas, to hybrid, to full electric. A Jeep spokesperson, Sean Szymkowski, declined to say what other propulsion options could eventually be available for the Cherokee beyond the hybrid.

Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said Thursday that the automaker planned to roll out hybrid technology similar to that of the Cherokee in other models soon. He noted other automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. have seen big success in recent years with their hybrid offerings.

The battery maker had been in talks with several major backers, including Scania, in search of a buyer this spring.
Truck and bus maker Scania has been one of Northvolt’s biggest backers, but its appetite for taking over the battery maker has not been high.
Another shift on the horizon is the expected arrival of solid-state battery tech that could once again upend the battery industry as demand for raw materials and technology shifts.
Northvolt's accelerating decline in Sweden is viewed as closing some doors long-term on the potential of battery production in northern Europe as a whole.","Northvolt's operations in Sweden are in danger of winding down as the battery maker navigates bankruptcy.

The company has been seeking to stem its cashflow over the past year by closing some units, but a takeover by an automaker has been elusive in Europe.

EV makers continue to be wary of battery production footprints on the continent.

A couple of short years ago, Northvolt was on a factory building spree with battery orders from several major automakers, including truck maker Scania.

Now, the company's assets are being liquidated at auction, and production could cease in a matter of months if a buyer is not found.

The battery startup enjoyed a momentous rise early in the decade, fueled by a consumer rush into EVs at the start of the pandemic.

The company seemingly faced no shortage of demand for EV batteries as Europe's automakers raced to quickly develop and field new electric models, favoring buyers in Europe if not always North America.

What went wrong?

In short, Northvolt expanded too quickly while also facing construction delays and production bottlenecks, which limited its revenue.

The battery startup was also caught between two different business environments in the EV sector, with its building boom having been fueled by a tide of EV optimism of the late 2010s and early 2020s that had quickly faded by 2023.

The battery maker had been in talks with several major backers, including Scania, in search of a buyer this spring.

Truck and bus maker Scania has been one of Northvolt’s biggest backers, but its appetite for taking over the battery maker has not been high.

But by the end of March it became apparent that no large purchaser was willing to step in, with the EV industry now facing a less certain outlook than just a couple of years prior.

Northvolt's US arm had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after a series of emergency cost-cutting measures, including the brisk closures of several research units.

But the cost-cutting measures were not enough to right the ship by spring 2025, as construction delays at plants on the other side of the Atlantic had continued to consume its cash reserves.

In March, Northvolt had filed for bankruptcy in Sweden as well, citing sudden shifts in demand, rising capital costs, production challenges, and geopolitical instability, among other factors.

Northvolt’s crisis has already delivered a significant blow to Europe’s EV sector.

Still, the company had maintained its operations during the last few months, even as bankruptcy proceedings unfolded.

""We ramped up production to meet customers' needs, reduced operational cash outflow by 55%, made tough decisions to pause or delay expansion plans, completed divestitures, and ultimately delivered our first one million battery cells to a European customer,"" Tom Johnstone, Interim Chairman of Northvolt's Board of Directors said in March.

In April, the company's sites and equipment from the Northvolt Ett gigafactory for various stages of the battery manufacturing process (valued at €300 million) were being sold in what is one of the continent's largest-ever bankruptcy auctions.

The sale was being handled by TBAuctions under the direction of bankruptcy trustee Jonas Premfors from law firm DLA Piper, and all the equipment needed for battery production has been put up for sale to the highest bidder.

""With some of the most cutting-edge technology and unique assets, it not only marks a significant moment for the industry but also contributes to the circular economy by giving this business equipment a second life,"" said Tom Christenson, CEO of TBAuctions.

The auction company noted that most of the equipment has never been unpacked and is in unused condition.

But with EV demand having taken a hit, coupled with the steady rise of battery makers in Asia, very few companies are looking to replicate what Northvolt has been doing in Europe, cognizant of the business pressures it faced.

Buying Northvolt's assets to start production again, therefore, does not immediately promise a vastly different result to potential buyers, even if the equipment and sites could be bought at a bargain.

From a broader perspective, Northvolt's crisis and ongoing decline has already delivered a significant blow to Europe's EV sector amid plenty of instability in the industry, while highlighting the fragile nature of the battery business, which now appears pointed almost entirely toward production in Asia.

And few companies in Europe are in the mood to compete cost-wise with off-the-shelf battery packs they could source elsewhere.

Northvolt certainly faced an uphill battle when it came to production costs, having relied on a footprint in northern Europe that is not known for low energy costs or quick industrial expansion, while also responding to severe shifts in the EV industry itself.

Another shift on the horizon is the expected arrival of solid-state battery tech that could once again upend the battery industry as demand for raw materials and technology shifts.

“Thousands of these jobs and billions in funding are at risk due to tariffs and pushes to repeal historic clean energy investments,” Gov.
While no specific reason was publicly cited by the company, the cuts follow a pattern of job losses amid clean energy uncertainty.
Advocates warn this will only be the beginning, particularly if Republicans in Congress charge forward with their plans to repeal incentives for developing more clean energy.
“Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power.","All seven Republicans in Michigan’s congressional delegation backed a bill that would gut energy investments and put thousands of new manufacturing jobs at risk.

MICHIGAN—Every Republican representing Michigan in the US Congress voted last week for legislation to slash federal clean energy funding—a move that’s threatening to upend billions of dollars in manufacturing projects and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs across the state.

Now, elected officials, school leaders, and more than 100 Michigan business owners—including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford—are urging Congress to reverse course on President Donald Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful” budget bill before it’s too late for Michigan’s economy.

“It needs to be kept in place, the production tax credit,” Bill Ford, the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, said during a panel at the Mackinac Policy Conference this week. “Don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment. … That’s unfair.”

Here’s the Deal:

Sweeping legislation passed last week by House Republicans through the reconciliation process would deliver large tax breaks to the wealthy while slashing funds for essential programs like Medicaid and food assistance. And to help pay for it all, the bill would also repeal an array of federal clean energy tax credits established through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Those credits have helped turn Michigan into a national leader in clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicle production—adding more than 25,000 new jobs and nearly $40 billion in private investment statewide since the legislation was signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.

That includes funding to support Ford’s $3 billion, 1.8 million-square-foot BlueOval Battery Park project in Marshall, where Ford is actively hiring up to 1,700 workers to help make EV batteries.

But instead of protecting the tools that led to that economic growth, Michigan’s Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives effectively voted to dismantle them altogether, blocking any additional federal investments to support the project in Marshall, as well as dozens of additional clean energy projects that have been announced across the state.

And as the legislation advances to the US Senate, more than 100 small business owners, school leaders, and elected officials—including Ford—are sounding alarm bells and urging Republican lawmakers not to slam the brakes on Michigan’s economic momentum.

“The economic impact of this investment cannot be overstated,” Marshall-area community leaders wrote in a joint letter to Michigan’s Congressional delegation. “These jobs will strengthen our communities and provide quality employment opportunities for local residents.”

Ford also warned that repealing federal tax credits that have been driving business investments and creating jobs across the state would “put in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan.”

“Politicians can agree or disagree on whether those kinds of things are desirable, and that’s fine, but don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment,” Ford said this week.

A Unified Front—Against Michigan Workers

All seven of Michigan’s Republican members of Congress voted in favor of the bill, including:

US Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), whose district alone has reportedly seen more than 4,100 new clean energy jobs and $3.5 billion in energy-related investments.

US Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who is running for governor and recently signed a letter warning that repealing federal energy tax credits would hurt American manufacturing—but then voted to do exactly that on the House floor last week.

Clean energy advocates say their votes directly threaten dozens of Michigan-based projects, including battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, solar panel factories, and other energy infrastructure. The legislation would also reportedly put over $1 billion at risk for General Motors and Stellantis projects, which would help revitalize manufacturing facilities in Michigan.

In Barrett’s district, advocacy groups like Protect Our Jobs are already airing ads titled “Turned Your Back” across the Lansing media market. The campaign accuses Barrett of selling out voters living in his own district in order to fund new tax cuts for billionaires.

“Barrett turned his back on his constituents by voting against clean energy production and good paying jobs in his district,” said Kevin Self, senior advisor for Protect Our Jobs. “So we’re bringing the message directly to his constituents: Rep. Barrett turned his back on you.”

Busting Michigan’s Clean Energy Boom

Michigan has led the country in clean energy development since the Inflation Reduction Act became law and is now home to 74 announced projects that are set to generate about $40 billion in private investment and support over 25,000 newly announced clean energy jobs.

But since Trump was elected, the tide has been turning.

Workforce reductions have already hit four major clean energy facilities across the state this year, costing Michiganders nearly 600 jobs over the last four months, Climate Power reports.

And recent estimates show that thousands more are on the chopping block.

“Thousands of these jobs and billions in funding are at risk due to tariffs and pushes to repeal historic clean energy investments,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement this month.

Among the Michigan facilities already dealing with layoffs and closures this year:

General Motors, Factory Zero (Hamtramck): This month, GM laid off about 200 workers at its EV battery production facility, citing “market dynamics.” The cuts target the battery pack area and the company has no plans to rehire for the positions.

ZF North America (Marysville): A $157.7 million federal investment for EV component production, which supported more than 500 jobs, was canceled after Trump took office, halting plans to modernize the facility and expand its workforce, according to the report.

Samsung SDI (Auburn Hills): The company laid off 179 workers at its automotive battery headquarters in January. While no specific reason was publicly cited by the company, the cuts follow a pattern of job losses amid clean energy uncertainty.

Akasol (Warren and Hazel Park): Two Michigan battery plants are being permanently closed this spring and all 188 workers are being laid off as production shifts out of state.

Advocates warn this will only be the beginning, particularly if Republicans in Congress charge forward with their plans to repeal incentives for developing more clean energy.

“Repealing clean energy investments would jeopardize hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs on its own,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “On top of this crisis of uncertainty, repeal would devastate American manufacturing—halting construction, sending jobs overseas, hiking energy costs, and forfeiting the future to China and our other competitors.”

Recent polling shows 70% of Americans oppose repealing clean energy investments, with 65% of Michiganders saying it would harm the economy if the US ceded leadership on EVs to China.

Transcript of Ranking Member Kaptur exchange with Secretary Wright:

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

So one of the things I have to ask about is my own district. I don't understand why there was a project that was to be awarded to a glass company. And for some reason, it was pulled or it's sitting somewhere over there, and it has caused all kinds of problems for the company. You're a businessman. You would understand this if I can find the right sheet here.

There's so many sheets of paper. It's called Libbey glass and they have two furnaces. I come from an industrial part of America and life there has been hell for a long time because we forgot what the defense industrial base of this country really is. And we've been trying to catch up, but it's been hard.

And oh, here it is. OK. So the department had $6 billion in DOE investments that were leveraged with $14 billion of private sector investment. And one of those companies, Libbey Glass, which gave me permission to even use their -- I'm even afraid to use their name in public. They're a great company. They're a legacy company in our community.

I'll start to cry. They're generous and they work hard. And they are to replace four regenerative furnaces with two larger hybrid electric furnaces to reduce the carbon intensity of its Toledo Ohio facility by up to 50 percent. And the department is considering canceling more than 60 percent of their industrial demonstration projects, which would be devastating to our community.

And this is a company that never left the city. They didn't go out into the suburbs, OK, and break more ground. They're a responsible company. And for this award review and cancellation process, how is DOE or any part of your administration assessing which DOE projects will be canceled or continued? What criteria are you using?

And even if DOE chooses not to cancel any of these awards, these actions are creating mass confusion. Unemployment is going up in our area, by the way, and companies have canceled almost $8 billion in energy manufacturing projects so far just this year, five times more than was canceled last year. So given your private sector background, what can you do to help me understand what is happening to this particular company in the review process? Where are they?

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

Representative Kaptur, I appreciate your passion for industrial America, keeping the industries we have, bringing new industries home. We are so aligned on that. It's one of the things I'm excited about this administration. We've outsourced so many of those jobs overseas. I was lucky. I grew up in suburban America and got a great education.

I've had a dreamy life. I could have been born somewhere else. I could have had a very different life. I share your passion.

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

Thank you.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

I share your passion. So I think I mentioned briefly, I walk into a department that I am very passionate about energy and all that. I want to support as many activities and projects as we can, to save American industry and grow American industry. So fully aligned on that. I think I gave the numbers before, but I walked into a thing where $100 billion had been shoveled out the door in 76 days.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT:

I'm responsible for that money now, either in money out the door or committed to money to go out the door. I can't look at American taxpayers, including taxpayers in your district and say, yes, we invested $2 billion and we built a bridge to nowhere. We built something and now it's just closed because it had no marketplace, it had nowhere to go. So let me give you a quick little summary. So the answer is we haven't canceled any projects because we've been slow and careful and deliberative. We've developed a process. And in the next few months, we will run hundreds of projects, including those through our thing.

And if it's viable and it's going to create jobs and it's going to do these great things, we're going to support that project. And the simple little criterion we're looking at is legal, um, that technology, is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that's being built?

Is there a financial model that that co-funding is coming in together with the DOE funding, so the project can be complete? And does it add to national or economic security? It sounds like that one, if all the other things work certainly would. And it is aligned with this agenda?

RANKING MEMBER MARCY KAPTUR:

Mr. Secretary, thank you for that, putting that on the record, but that was already approved. You are reviewing something that was -- all the appropriated money was already there. Those decisions had been made. So that is a very -- this is a very strange process because that -- those dollars weren't to be spent, um, already as we work toward the '26 budget.

The alpine hamlet of 300 inhabitants—who were evacuated earlier amid warning signs of disaster—was almost completely wiped out on Wednesday after the Birch Glacier, located in the Lötschental Valley in northern Switzerland, collapsed. The glacial avalanche, laden with boulders and other debris, cascaded down the mountainside and into the village, obliterating everything in its path. Local officials said around 90% of Blatten was buried.

""We've lost our village,"" Blatten Mayor Matthias Bellwald told reporters. ""The village is under rubble. We will rebuild.""

While there are no verified casualties from the disaster, one 64-year-old man has been reported missing.

Mathieu Morlighem, a glaciologist at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, toldABC News that permafrost thaw under and along the sidewalls surrounding the glacier likely caused the collapse.

""What happened to Birch Glacier is what we would expect from rising temperatures in the Alps and elsewhere,"" he explained. ""I think we can expect more events like this in the future.""

As ABC News reported:

Glaciers in Switzerland have lost almost 40% of their volume since 2000, and the loss is accelerating, according to the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow, and Landscape Research. Record-high summer temperatures in 2022 and 2023 caused a 10% glacial ice loss in the country.

Experts warn that Switzerland's glaciers could disappear completely by 2100 due to the climate emergency.

As Common Dreamsreported in March, the crisis is planetary and is predicted to adversely affect nearly 2 billion people who depend upon glaciers for agricultural irrigation and drinking water.

""Most of the world's glaciers, including those in mountains, are melting at an accelerated rate worldwide,"" a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization report published earlier this year warned. ""Combined with accelerating permafrost thaw, declining snow cover, and more erratic snowfall patterns... this will have significant and irreversible impacts on local, regional, and global hydrology, including water availability.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60341959&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-05-30 18:08:49.512541

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That’s far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area’s geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump’s fossil fuel agenda,” she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They’ve had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission’s permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state’s contested case process.

The canceled awards were mainly for carbon capture and sequestration and other decarbonization projects, according to DOE. Affected companies include PPL Corp., Ørsted and Exxon Mobil Corp.

The Calpine projects are for CCS projects at its 550-MW gas-fired Sutter power plant in Yuba City, California, and its 810-MW Baytown power plant in Baytown, Texas.

“After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, the DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE said.

Sixteen of the 24 terminated awards were signed between President Donald Trump’s election in November and Jan. 20, according to DOE.

“DOE is prioritizing large-scale commercial projects that require more detailed information from the awardees for the initial phase of this review, but this process may extend to other DOE program offices as the reviews progress,” the department said.

Nigel Farage’s party — which took control of 10 councils in the recent local elections — this week claimed that the government could save £45 billion every year by ditching climate policies.

However, analysis by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) published today suggests that Reform’s policies would cost jobs and investment, and could raise household energy bills.

Reform, which is currently raising money from oil and gas executives, has vowed to ditch the government’s target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, scrap subsidies for renewable energy, and impose a windfall tax on wind and solar companies. Farage’s party would also expand new North Sea oil and gas extraction, claiming it would cut energy bills.

The NEF analysis estimates that Farage’s policies would cost more than 60,000 jobs in the growing wind and solar sectors by the end of the decade.

The analysis adds that 60,000 could be a “significant understatement”, given there are 273,000 people employed in these sectors, plus 678,000 in related supply chains.

This dwarfs the small number of new jobs that would likely be created by Reform’s plans to approve new North Sea oil and gas licences, said NEF. While the UK’s oil and gas reserves are dwindling, the country’s green economy grew by 10 percent in 2024.

The report concludes that making the UK renewables industry “unviable” would cost the economy around £92 billion – almost 3 percent of the UK’s GDP.

“Reform UK’s attack on net zero is reckless, economically illiterate and dangerous for Britain’s future,” said Chaitanya Kumar, head of economic and environmental policy at NEF.

“These measures will prevent billions of pounds being invested into the UK economy, drive up bills and will cost tens of thousands of jobs, including in some of the most deprived parts of the country.”

The analysis notes that Reform’s plan to expand oil and gas extraction would leave the UK vulnerable to a “gas price spike”, such as happened after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which could add at least £230 to household energy bills by 2030 compared to current government targets.

Kumar added: “The reality is net zero and investing in renewables is the greatest economic opportunity in this century. It will strengthen our economy, help cut bills for people across the country and help tackle the cost of living crisis.”

This comes as the party’s two recently elected mayors, Luke Campbell in Hull and East Yorkshire and Andrea Jenkyns in Greater Lincolnshire, have already drifted away from Reform’s anti-renewable policies and backed green investment in their areas.

As DeSmog previously revealed, Reform UK received £2.3 million from climate deniers, polluters and fossil fuel interests between the 2019 and 2024 general elections — equivalent to 92 percent of its funding during the period.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/farage-parliament.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 13:19:16.143560

Roeska stated that Ford has been “prudent” by “delaying and canceling EV growth” as it continues to work on its Model e unit.
Ford‘s EV unit reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million.
Despite a slight growth of 3% year to date, the stock has lost nearly 16% over the past twelve months.

In a new research note, the analyst said China’s EV market is “pushing ahead with scale and innovation” bifurcating the global EV industry and causing “distinct implications for OEMs, suppliers, energy players, and investors.”

“What follows is a capital intensive, politically volatile, and operationally complex expansion into the mainstream,” Roeska wrote.

Last week, Donald Trump’s bill proposing to cut EV tax credits was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, moving to the Senate.

On Thursday, U.S. EV maker Tesla urged the chamber for a “sensible wind down” on clean energy tax cuts, as they could “threaten America’s energy independence.”

Bernstein considered the Jeep maker Stellantis to be the “best positioned in the EV-slowdown” due to its “new multi technology platform,” as the brand produces various types of powertrains.

Roeska also noted that the group benefits from the “exposure to a faster growing EV market in Europe,” which places Stellantis better “than Detroit peers.”

According to the analyst, General Motors has been “cautious” by “reducing planned investments in battery manufacturing.”

Despite “slower EV volume growth and delayed EV profitability, GM is also avoiding knee-jerk reactions and taking a longer-term view,” he said.

Roeska stated that Ford has been “prudent” by “delaying and canceling EV growth” as it continues to work on its Model e unit.

The U.S. company reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings.

Ford‘s EV unit reported a first-quarter EBIT loss of $849 million. In the new note, Roeska said that “the company’s reporting structure makes it very visible that it will continue to lose billions on its EV business unit Model e.”

This, combined with the lack of “significant volume growth,” could result in Ford being “unable to turn a profit in upcoming years.”

Last week, Daniel Roeska had raised Ford’s price target to $8.30 over a “lower tariff impact in 2025” than previously expected. However, the new target still implied a downside of 20%.

Roeska had maintained the Underperform rating on the stock as it expects a “weaker” second half of the year due to “production cuts and tariff headwinds.”

Citing uncertainty over the tariff scenario, the automaker suspended its financial forecast as it reported its quarterly results, stating that it expected a $1.5 billion hit from Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading star-gazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.”

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Cuts $3.7 Billion for New Technologies to Lower Emissions - The New York Times,"Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/climate/energy-dept-climate-tech-awards-cut.html,"The Energy Department announced on Friday that it was terminating $3.7 billion in Biden-era awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that might one day help tackle global warming.

The Biden administration had worked to award most of those funds before President Trump came into office, including $6 billion for technologies to cut industrial emissions.

This week, the Energy Department canceled a partial loan guarantee worth $2.92 billion to Sunnova Energy, a residential solar panel installer that was experimenting with a novel way to link home solar and battery systems.","The Energy Department announced on Friday that it was terminating $3.7 billion in Biden-era awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that might one day help tackle global warming.

Some of the 24 canceled awards would have gone to industrial companies that were aiming to reduce emissions from cement, iron, glass and chemicals production. Others had been awarded to fossil fuel and cement companies attempting to trap and bury carbon dioxide from their smokestacks before the gas escapes into the atmosphere and heats the planet.

Two of the terminated awards, worth $540 million in all, would have gone to Calpine, one of the nation’s largest producers of electricity, which was trying to capture and store the carbon from two large natural gas power plants in Yuba City, Calif., and Baytown, Texas.

Also on the chopping block was a $331 million award to the oil giant Exxon Mobil, which had been planning to replace natural gas with lower-emissions hydrogen at a chemical facility in Baytown, Texas.

In announcing the cuts, the Energy Department said in a statement that the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

“Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. He said that the previous administration had “failed to conduct a thorough financial review” of the spending and suggested the process had been rushed, noting that 16 of the awards had been made between Election Day and President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

Congress had approved tens of billions of dollars for trials of novel energy technologies as part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The goal was to demonstrate promising techniques for cutting emissions so that companies would later invest in them.

The Biden administration had worked to award most of those funds before President Trump came into office, including $6 billion for technologies to cut industrial emissions. Many of the awards were legally binding, but they often had conditions attached to them and most of the money has yet to be spent.

At a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Wright said he wanted to review all Biden-era awards closely. The Trump administration has sought to drastically scale back the federal role in addressing climate change.

This month, the Energy Department announced that it would scrutinize a separate batch of 179 awards worth $15 billion, including funding to upgrade electric grids and promote domestic battery manufacturing. The agency said it would demand extensive information from awardees and warned that failure to respond adequately could be used as grounds for termination. The agency has not announced the results of that review.

Some experts said that canceling efforts to test novel technologies would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage.

“Many of these projects involve new ways to make cement or chemicals, and they’re things that China and other countries are already investing in,” said Evan Chapman, senior director of policy at Clean Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization focused on technological innovation in energy. “If we’re not making these investments, we’ll be losing the race to develop and demonstrate and deploy these advanced technologies.”

Mr. Chapman pointed out that China has recently announced more than 100 energy demonstration projects, which included new ways to make clean-burning hydrogen fuels or low-carbon steel.

Other awards canceled by the Energy Department on Friday include: $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, a cement manufacturer that aims to capture and bury the carbon dioxide emissions from a large cement plant in Louisiana; $189 million to Brimstone, a company trying to reduce emissions from cement by changing the ingredients, using carbon-free silicate rock instead of limestone; and $170.9 million to Kraft Heinz, a food manufacturer, which had planned to install electric boilers and heat pumps to generate the large amounts of heat needed for things like drying macaroni without directly burning fossil fuels.

The Energy Department still oversees tens of billions of dollars that it has obligated for a wide variety of other energy projects, including hubs to produce hydrogen fuels and to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The agency’s Loan Programs Office has also awarded more than $100 billion in loans and loan guarantees to mining companies, electric vehicle makers and other companies trying to bring nascent technologies to market.

But some of that funding has also started to be pulled back. This week, the Energy Department canceled a partial loan guarantee worth $2.92 billion to Sunnova Energy, a residential solar panel installer that was experimenting with a novel way to link home solar and battery systems.

In that case, the loan cancellation came after Sunnova said that it didn’t intend to use the funds “for the foreseeable future.” Sunnova’s business had been running into trouble even before the Trump administration came into office, partly because of high interest rates and reduced state incentives.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30cli-energy-tkbv/30cli-energy-tkbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:46.871602

“We’ll be digging in the Army Corps’ DEIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement); however, our position on the tunnel and Line 5 has not changed,"" the Sierra Club's Anne Woiwode said in a statement.
The suits in state and federal court have so far been unsuccessful in closing the line or eliminating the agreement.","Lansing — Federal regulators on Friday released a long-awaited draft study that found that most of the environmental effects resulting from constructing a tunnel to house Line 5 beneath the Straits of Mackinac would be temporary and tied almost exclusively to construction activities.

The tunnel, the study found, would have a ""beneficial cumulative effect"" on reducing the risk of a crude oil leak from the pipeline.

The draft Environmental Impact Statement released Friday, a report the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working on for nearly five years, analyzed Enbridge's proposed 3.6-mile tunnel to house a new segment of Line 5 and two other alternatives to the tunnel: Doing nothing and keeping the current dual pipeline in place on the lakebed, or covering exposed portions of the current dual pipeline with gravel and rock.

""The applicant’s preferred alternative,"" the report said, referring to the tunnel construction proposal, ""would have a beneficial cumulative effect on reduced risks of a petroleum leak in the Straits and, when combined with one of the decommissioning sub-alternatives, improvements to water-based recreation.""

The release of the draft statement launches a 30-day public comment period, the preparation of a final statement, and the expected release of a final record of decision this fall. The decision timeline has been somewhat shortened by President Donald Trump's declaration of a national energy emergency in January, which speeds up the deliberation process. The approval is one of the last Enbridge needs before it moves forward with tunnel construction; it is also awaiting one other state permit.

Enbridge, in a statement Friday, said the report is an important ""milestone"" in the project and incorporates extensive survey work generated from more than 40,000 data points.

""Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,"" said Ryan Duffy, a spokesman for Enbridge. ""The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the DEIS (draft Environmental Impact Statement) to further refine the project.""

The Sierra Club Michigan Chapter in a statement Friday argued Gov. Gretchen Whitmer should ""step in"" and block the tunnel from moving forward. Whitmer's legal efforts to close the pipeline have so far been unsuccessful, but her Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy currently is assessing a permit request from Enbridge for the tunnel.

“We’ll be digging in the Army Corps’ DEIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement); however, our position on the tunnel and Line 5 has not changed,"" the Sierra Club's Anne Woiwode said in a statement. ""Line 5 remains an existential threat. Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits.""

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prepared the environmental impact statement released Thursday as part of its consideration of a permit for the project under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act.

The corps also is analyzing, separate from the EIS, the tunnel construction’s impact to historic properties and its potential impingement on the treaty rights of federally recognized tribes. The corps’ analysis of those factors will be included in the final record of decision expected this fall.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said in a statement Friday.

Overall, the study found construction of the tunnel would have temporary effects on noise, vibration, aesthetics, recreation, some wildlife and geology in the area while the structure is being built. The lasting negative effects, the statement found, were confined to a loss of several acres of vegetation and wetlands due to the buildings that would be constructed at the entrance and exit of the tunnel in Mackinaw City and St. Ignace.

The tunnel, the corps found, would serve as a secondary containment in the event of a leak from the pipeline and would reduce the maintenance and surveillance activities currently required to ensure the safety of the dual pipelines that have been located on the lakebed since the 1960s.

The analysis found there would be a steady or slightly increased need through 2050 for the products transported through the pipeline. Analysts noted that determination was made before the current president lifted restrictions and encouraged domestic energy exploration.

""The USACE determined the current needs for transport of the pipeline products are supported by their existing use, and the need for the pipeline products in the foreseeable future is supported,"" the report said.

Failure of the tunnel via a collapse or explosion — concerns raised by some opponents to the plan — ""is not reasonably foreseeable,"" the report said.

The corps' analysis of an alternative to the tunnel — that of covering exposed portions of the current pipeline with gravel or rock — found doing so would result in a permanent change in the lakebed. However, the study found, overall, the cumulative detrimental effects would be less under the gravel protective cover alternative than under the proposed tunnel.

But both the gravel protective cover or the continued current placement of the dual pipelines on the lakebed fail to provide a secondary containment method in the event of a leak, the report found.

The report also noted there are drawbacks to keeping the dual pipeline in place as is.

""Maintenance activities would continue to occur,"" the report indicated. ""As the pipelines age, it is anticipated that additional deterioration could result in some release of metals into the surface water. In addition, the potential for vessel anchor strikes would remain.""

While the likelihood of anchor strikes under both the gravel cover and current arrangement are unlikely, the tunnel plan eliminates the probability completely, the report found.

Under the report issued by the corps, the risk of an anchor strike with the current placement of the dual pipelines is about once every 1,300 years; the potential failure rate of a gravel cover due to an anchor strike is once every 128,000 years.

The pipeline was struck by an anchor in 2018 and, in 2020, was ordered shut down temporarily after an inspection uncovered damage to one of the pipeline’s anchor supports that appeared to indicate something had been dragged across it.

The 2018 anchor strike advanced discussions between then Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and Enbridge, both of whom had been debating extra security measures for the pipeline after a 2010 spill from Enbridge's Line 6B in Marshall raised concerns about a similar catastrophe involving Line 5's Straits of Mackinac segment at the intersection of Lakes Michigan and Huron.

Shortly before leaving office in 2018, Snyder entered an agreement with Enbridge in which the company agreed to spend more than $500 million building a tunnel and replacement segment of Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac.

The agreement and Line 5's continued operation in the Straits were challenged by Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel and Whitmer in several different lawsuits. The suits in state and federal court have so far been unsuccessful in closing the line or eliminating the agreement. However, cases still are pending in Ingham County Circuit Court and U.S. District Court regarding the pipeline's continued operation.

Additionally, a regulatory approval for the tunnel project awarded by the Michigan Public Service Commission has been appealed and is currently awaiting a decision from the Michigan Supreme Court. And the U.S. continues treaty negotiations with Canada after the neighbor to the north in 2021 invoked a never-before-used treaty to protect the pipeline from Michigan's efforts to close it.

Home Electrification Incentives in North Dakota

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.

The administration plans to use the LPO to support investments that will restart closed nuclear power plants, increase the output of operating plants, build new advanced reactors, and strengthening the US nuclear fuel supply chain.
Bipartisan support for nuclear power is strong in the Senate.","One of the best-known sayings of the celebrated free-market economist Thomas Sowell is: “There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.” The Trump administration has faced a sharp demonstration of that point over its policy on nuclear power.

President Donald Trump last week signed four executive orders aimed at delivering the often-promised “nuclear renaissance” for the US. Trump administration officials, including Chris Wright, the energy secretary, have made it clear that they see increased nuclear generation as essential for US national security.

But the budget legislation currently being negotiated in Congress includes several measures that would hold back the growth of nuclear power in the US.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives last week and is now before the Senate, meets many of the administration’s overall goals for tax and spending policy.

But among its wide-ranging impacts on the energy industry are changes that the US nuclear industry has flagged as concerns. In particular, the bill confirms the phase-out for the 45U tax credit for existing nuclear plants that was created in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, bringing it forward by a year to the end of 2031.

It also accelerates the phase-out of the 48E technology-neutral investment tax credit for zero-carbon energy. Under the bill passed by the House, nuclear projects would have to start construction by the end of 2028 to be eligible. That is not much time to get a new project underway.

The House also proposed cutting funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO). The office has supported nuclear investments, including the two AP1000 reactors built at the Vogtle plant in Georgia and the restart of the Palisades reactor in Michigan.

The administration plans to use the LPO to support investments that will restart closed nuclear power plants, increase the output of operating plants, build new advanced reactors, and strengthening the US nuclear fuel supply chain.

But the House budget bill withdraws any funding for the LPO that has not already been committed. It has been reported that nearly 60% of the office’s staff could be leaving.

The final version of the bill that emerges after negotiations with the Senate could be significantly different from the version passed in the House. The nuclear industry is still arguing its case. Maria Korsnick, CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said earlier this month: “We’re facing some headwinds, and the actions we take today will define what the future looks like.”

In contrast to the bad news coming out of Congress, President Trump’s executive orders have been welcomed by the industry. The most significant of those orders will expedite approvals by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), setting a new deadline of 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type.

Scott Strazik, chief executive of GE Vernova, said in an interview that the first new NRC approvals for small modular reactors (SMRs) could be granted by 2027, creating a “credible shot” of having the first plants on stream by late 2030 or 2031.

There is also financial support available for SMRs. The Department of Energy recently reissued a US$900 million funding program for Generation III+ light-water SMRs, originally set up under the Biden administration.

But there are questions over how far expedited approvals and support for demonstration projects will drive investment in new nuclear, if the fundamental economics are unfavorable.

Bipartisan support for nuclear power is strong in the Senate. But it remains to be seen how far senators will push for pro-nuclear provisions in the bill, given all the other pressures they face to deliver tax cuts and limit the increase in the budget deficit.

The Wood Mackenzie view

Despite the threats posed by the proposed legislation, Wood Mackenzie analysts still think the US nuclear industry has a bright long-term future. Both commercial and policy imperatives point to the need to develop and deploy new reactors.

The Trump administration’s energy policies reflect a view that the US should not try to compete with China in electric vehicles, solar power and energy storage. Chinese manufacturers generally dominate these global supply chains so it will be difficult to displace them.

But in new nuclear technologies such as SMRs, the competition is less intense, says Prakash Sharma, Wood Mackenzie’s head of scenarios and technologies. There is still room for the US to innovate and scale up to out-compete China.

For US companies planning to increase their electricity consumption, particularly data centre operators aiming to bring new capacity online, new nuclear plants could be important.

The time taken to develop and build new reactors means they will be able to make only a marginal contribution for the next 10 years at least. But in the long term, new nuclear plants could make a significant contribution to increasing US electricity supply.

Nuclear power is particularly attractive for tech companies that need dispatchable power to keep their data centres running 24/7 and have set ambitious goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Only a handful of technologies are available for providing zero-carbon baseload electricity, and nuclear is one of them.

All that said, the version of the budget bill passed by the House does pose some threats to the US nuclear industry in the short to medium term. But Wood Mackenzie’s Sharma says there is still time for the Senate to fight for more pro-nuclear measures in the legislation.

“The final version of the bill might look more acceptable and amenable to the industry and investors,” he says.

Supreme Court ruling tightens scope of US environmental reviews

The US Supreme Court has issued an important ruling on environmental approvals that could help remove obstacles to infrastructure development. The court ruled in favour of a group attempting to build an 88-mile railway line from the Uinta Basin oil province in Utah to connect to the national rail network. Environmental groups and a county in Colorado had been fighting against the project. They had success in lower courts with the argument that the environmental impact statement for the railway required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) had not considered all the relevant issues, even though it was 3,600 pages long.

The Supreme Court rejected that view in a unanimous decision. Lower courts had accepted the argument that the environmental impact statement should take into account activities connected to the project. So if the new rail line would allow increased oil production in the Uinta Basin, and increased consumption of oil products refined from that crude, the resulting increase in emissions should be factored into the decision on whether to approve the project.

The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that only the direct impacts from the rail line should be considered. The decision could have wide-ranging implications for other energy projects that need approvals under NEPA, such as LNG plants, potentially blocking off some tactics that have been used by environmental groups to obstruct development.

In brief

Most of President Trump’s new tariffs were blocked by the US Court of International Trade, but then reinstated, at least for the time being, by an appeals court. The trade court had ruled that the president had overstepped his legal authority in announcing such sweeping tariff measures. The appeals court put a stay on the lower court’s decision until it had had a chance to consider the arguments from both sides.

The US Constitution specifies that it is Congress that has the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises”, although legislation has given the president a range of opportunities to impose tariffs in emergencies and other specified circumstances. The dispute is now likely to head to the Supreme Court for a ruling.

Ministers from the OPEC+ countries agreed at a meeting on Wednesday to leave their production levels unchanged. The eight members of the group that have been unwinding their voluntary output cuts, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, will be discussing their plans for further increases over the weekend. Brent crude was trading at about US$64 a barrel on Friday morning, close to its level at the start of the week.

BYD, the Chinese car company that is the world’s largest manufacturer of EVs, has announced steep price cuts ranging up to 34% for some models. The move has raised fears about the profitability of China’s vehicle industry.

Quote of the week

“By removing these barriers that have held back our economy, we will unleash a new era of growth that will ensure we don't just survive ongoing trade wars but emerge from them stronger than ever. It will enable Canada to become the world's leading energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy. To build an industrial strategy that will make Canada more globally competitive, while fighting climate change.”

King Charles III, giving a speech in Canada’s Senate for the opening of the new session of Parliament, set out the agenda for the government led by Prime Minister Mark Carney. The king’s words, delivered in French, highlighted the priorities set out by the new government.

Tim Hodgson, the energy and natural resources minister, used similar language recently, saying the government was committed “to making Canada an energy superpower”.

Chart of the week

This comes from our new Horizons report, Trading cases: Tariff scenarios for taxing times. The volatility of US tariff policy means it is impossible to derive forecasts for energy and commodities over the next few years and stick to them with any confidence. In response, we have developed three scenarios, essentially reflecting low, moderate and high tariffs, and then modelled the outlooks for our key sectors in those scenarios.

The chart here shows projections for oil demand in those three cases. In “trade truce” and “trade tensions”, or low and moderate tariff scenarios, the world economy continues to grow and, hence, so does oil demand. In the “trade war”, we have a global recession, resulting in significantly lower oil demand and prices.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/cities/_micro_city_nyc_gettyimages-1005120852.jpeg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-05-30 14:27:50.678025

Montana constitutional climate case, are suing the Trump administration over its climate and energy policies.

The plaintiffs argue in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that by dismantling climate protections and working to “unleash” American energy, the executive branch is violating the separation of powers clause in the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also argue that the president’s executive orders are threatening their rights to life and liberty.

The lead plaintiff in the litigation is Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old Livingston resident who also was a plaintiff in a constitutional lawsuit that challenged Montana’s permissive approach to approving fossil fuel projects. Lighthiser is joined by Rikki Held and eight other plaintiffs from the Montana litigation, as well as a handful of young Americans from Hawaii, Oregon, Florida and California.

During a seven-day bench trial in 2023, the Held lawsuit focused an international spotlight on Montana and its unique constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment,” which the district court — and later the Montana Supreme Court — interpreted to include a “stable climate system.”

The federal lawsuit Lighthiser and her co-plaintiffs filed on May 29 challenges three executive orders that Trump issued during the first three months of his second term in the White House. The plaintiffs argue that the orders have suppressed climate science and slowed the transition to renewable energy sources in favor of fossil fuels, “thereby worsening the air pollution and climate conditions that immediately harm and endanger Plaintiffs’ lives and personal security.”

The plaintiffs are asking the court to invalidate the executive orders and direct Trump and the 11 federal agencies listed as defendants not to implement or enforce them.

“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the 126-page filing reads.

In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser described Trump’s fossil fuel directives as a “death sentence for my generation.”

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to,” said Lighthiser, who plans to pursue environmental studies in college. “My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. [President Trump is] waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.”

In an email to Montana Free Press on Thursday, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended Trump’s energy agenda.

“The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance. Future generations should not have to foot the bill for the lefts’ radical climate agenda,” Rogers wrote.

In addition to enumerating the climate harms plaintiffs have reported, including wildfire-related and heat-induced visits to the emergency room, diminished career opportunities, property damage spurred by extreme weather events and a loss of cultural and recreational traditions, the complaint outlines tensions between Trump’s executive orders and the missions of congressionally authorized agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One of the executive orders named in the lawsuit directs federal agencies to identify and rescind actions that place an “undue burden” on the “identification, development or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral and nuclear energy resources.” Another directs executive branch agencies to use emergency powers to facilitate energy companies’ access to federally-owned energy resources and the infrastructure required to transport and process them. The third focuses on the development and prioritization of coal-fired electricity.

After two months of crude oil prices hovering around $60 a barrel, companies are shutting down drilling rigs and laying off workers as they pare spending. It now appears very likely that U.S. oil production will not grow much this year, if at all.

There are two main reasons for low oil prices. President Trump’s trade war is likely to slow the global economy, hurting demand for fuel. And OPEC Plus, an oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia, is increasing production of oil as demand is softening.

On Saturday, eight members of the cartel are widely expected to announce plans to bring even more oil to market this summer, which could send prices lower still.

American oil companies are not waiting to find out.

While Exxon Mobil and Chevron are maintaining their spending plans, smaller companies are pulling back. Those focused on drilling for oil now plan to spend around 3.5 percent less this year than previously planned, according to a BloombergNEF analysis of a dozen publicly traded companies. All things equal, more drilling tends to drive oil prices down and less drilling generally props them up.

“We can’t run our program on hope,” Tom Jorden, chief executive of the oil and gas producer Coterra Energy, told analysts during an earnings call this month. “So we are battening down the hatches, expecting this to last for a while.”

The Houston-based company said it would drill less in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. oil field, and more in the Northeast, which is rich in natural gas. Prices for that fuel, used in power plants and for heating, have been much more resilient.

Lower oil production is the opposite of what Mr. Trump promised during his campaign, which frequently repeated the chant “Drill, baby, drill.”

The pullback means that production in U.S. shale basins, which generate most of the country’s oil, is likely to start declining later this year, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based organization of industrialized countries including the United States.

The contraction could be swift if oil falls under $60 a barrel and remains there. For every dollar below that threshold, the I.E.A. estimates, five drilling rigs could be pulled out of U.S. fields. When companies drop rigs, workers often lose their jobs, hurting the economy of states like Texas.

Diamondback Energy, one of the Permian’s largest oil producers, said the heart of the U.S. oil industry had already hit peak production. The country pumps more than 13 million barrels of oil each day, making it the world’s biggest oil producer.

“It is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter,” Travis Stice, who until recently was chief executive of Diamondback, wrote in a May 5 letter to shareholders. “To use a driving analogy, we are taking our foot off the accelerator as we approach a red light.”

Diamondback cut its annual spending forecast by 10 percent.

Oil prices have been volatile in recent months, falling as the United States and its trading partners have raised tariffs, then recovering just as quickly on any hint of a pause in trade hostilities.

Late Wednesday, for example, prices climbed toward $63 a barrel after the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked Mr. Trump from putting in place some of his highest tariffs. They retreated on Thursday, the same day a federal court temporarily paused that ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now.

What has remained consistent is that oil fetches much less than it did before Mr. Trump took office, when it was close to $80 a barrel. Then, most U.S. producers were earning healthy profits.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/30/multimedia/30biz-oil-slowdown-bzgc/30biz-oil-slowdown-bzgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:57.501419

Environmental groups and a neighboring Colorado county had told the justices that the federal agency that approved the project had failed to consider its broader environmental costs.
In approving the project in December of that year, the board explained that the project’s “substantial transportation and economic benefits” outweighed those environmental effects.
It reasoned that the board should have taken a “hard look” at all of the railroad’s environmental effects.
This would include, the court of appeals said, both the “upstream” effects – effects from oil drilling in the basin – and the “downstream” effects – effects from oil refining along the Gulf Coast.","The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled to limit the scope of environmental review required under a seminal 1970s environmental protection law. The move brought a proposed 88-mile railroad line that would transport crude oil from oilfields in northern Utah to refineries on the Gulf Coast one step closer to production. Environmental groups and a neighboring Colorado county had told the justices that the federal agency that approved the project had failed to consider its broader environmental costs.

In ruling for the railroad, the justices sketched out a relatively narrow role for courts reviewing future decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act, the landmark environmental law at the center of the case. Emphasizing that the “goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it,” Justice Brett Kavanagh explained that courts should give “substantial deference” to the agency’s determination as to what should be included in the environmental impact statement prepared for a project. “In deciding cases involving the American economy,” Kavanaugh concluded, “courts should strive, where possible, for clarity and predictability.”

The court’s three Democratic appointees agreed more narrowly with the result that their colleagues reached, even if they did not agree with the reasoning that they used to arrive at that conclusion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the majority “unnecessarily ground[ed] its analysis largely in matters of policy,” but the board, based on the statute itself, did not have the power to reject the application to build the railroad based on any negative effects that might flow from products carried on the railway.

The dispute before the court began after the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a proposal by a group of Utah counties to build a railroad line that would connect with the broader interstate freight rail network to “facilitate the transportation of crude oil” from the state’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to refineries in states like Louisiana and Texas. The proposed train would quadruple production at Utah’s largest oil and gas fields. In August 2021, the board released an environmental impact statement that was more than 3,600 pages long and addressed the environmental consequences of the project. In approving the project in December of that year, the board explained that the project’s “substantial transportation and economic benefits” outweighed those environmental effects.

Several environmental groups and Eagle County, Colorado, challenged the board’s decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court threw out the board’s order approving the project. It reasoned that the board should have taken a “hard look” at all of the railroad’s environmental effects. This would include, the court of appeals said, both the “upstream” effects – effects from oil drilling in the basin – and the “downstream” effects – effects from oil refining along the Gulf Coast.

On Thursday the Supreme Court reversed. Kavanaugh explained that although NEPA requires agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement “identifying significant environmental effects of the projects, as well as feasible alternatives,” the law at its core “is purely procedural.” In reaching its decision about whether a project should go forward, he wrote, “an ‘agency is not constrained by NEPA from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs.’”

When courts are reviewing these determinations, Kavanaugh continued, “the central principle” is “deference.” Kavanaugh acknowledged that since last year’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, courts generally do not provide deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statute, instead taking a fresh look at the law. “But when” – as in this situation – “an agency exercises discretion granted by a statute,” Kavanaugh wrote, courts instead look at whether the agency action “was reasonable and reasonably explained.” In NEPA cases, he stated, “an agency’s only obligation is to prepare an adequate report.”

Kavanaugh spelled out the limits on the role of the courts even more clearly, stressing that “it is critical to disaggregate the agency’s role from the court’s role. So long as the EIS addresses environmental effects from the project at issue,” he wrote, “courts should defer to agencies’ decisions about where to draw the line—including (i) how far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand and (ii) whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.”

Kavanaugh also criticized courts that have in the past, in his view, not provided the kind of deference that NEPA requires. In doing so, he suggested, those courts “have slowed down or blocked many projects and, in turn, caused litigation-averse agencies to take ever more time and to prepare even longer EISs for future projects.” And as a result, he concluded, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects.”

The effects of that transformation, Kavanaugh explained, are significant. “Fewer projects make it to the finish line” or even “the starting line,” he stated – and the ones that do make it are more expensive. “A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak,” he said, “that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process.”

The D.C. Circuit’s ruling was also wrong, Kavanaugh added, because the board was not required to address the environmental effects of “projects that are separate in time or place from the” railroad itself. Indeed, Kavanaugh observed, “those separate projects fall outside the Board’s authority and would be initiated, if at all, by” other parties.

In an 11-page opinion, Sotomayor faulted the majority for relying on policy considerations but explained that the board did not have the power to reject railroad applications based on the ways that other entities would use the products carried on the proposed railroad. As a result, she reasoned, the board could not have rejected the Utah counties’ request based on a desire to “prevent the harmful effects of oil drilling and refining.” Therefore, she concluded, she agreed with her colleagues’ decision to reverse the D.C. Circuit’s ruling “requiring the Board to consider in further detail harms caused by the oil industry.”",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/supreme-court2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 13:19:37.056566

Eight of the top 10 states for utility-scale clean energy deployment in the first quarter of 2025 voted Republican in last year’s Presidential election, the American Clean Power Association said on Thursday.

Texas was the runaway leader with more than 1,700 MW of wind, solar and energy storage deployments and a 20% year-over-year increase in total clean energy capacity. Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Wyoming rounded out the top five, ACP said.

The 7.4 GW of new clean power capacity in the U.S. was the second-strongest Q1 on record. Energy storage was the fastest-growing segment, with nationwide battery storage capacity increasing 65% year over year.

Dive Insight:

Total utility-scale clean energy deployments in the first quarter of this year came in 9% shy of the record-setting first quarter of 2024, when developers commissioned 8,089 MW of wind, solar and storage capacity, ACP said.

ACP’s data reflects the increasingly broad geography of utility-scale solar and storage deployments. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity, adding 435 MW, while Illinois, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Ohio all deployed far more solar than California. Total U.S. clean energy capacity sits at about 320.9 GW — of which, 80.7 GW is in Texas, ACP said.

The clean power development pipeline expanded as well, growing 12% year over year to reach about 184.4 GW and an estimated $328 billion in completed value. But that marks a slowdown from a year ago, when fully permitted clean power capacity under construction or in advanced development rose 26% from Q1 2023.

Developers have canceled more than $14 billion in clean energy projects so far this year amid uncertainty over the future of federal tax credits for clean energy investment, production and manufacturing, according to the consulting group E2.

ACP’s latest report hinted at the scale of the potential risk to state and local economies if the House GOP’s proposed rapid wind-down of energy tax credits remains in the final budget reconciliation bill that now sits before the Senate.

Domestic manufacturing and energy production investments now generate $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and landowner payments in rural communities and have created nearly 650,000 jobs, ACP said.

“We have the technology, investment capital and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline,” Grumet said, describing those projects as shovel-ready. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Utilities and independent power producers across the South, Midwest and West have proposed dozens of gigawatts of new gas-fired generation projects since 2023, including an up to 4.5-GW project in western Pennsylvania that could begin operations next year and eventually become the United States’ largest gas power plant.

However, Senior U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello in her ruling late Thursday prohibited Denver Water from filling Gross Reservoir and ordered federal environmental permits to be rewritten by the Army Corps of Engineers.

“There is no evidence that there would be additional environmental injury resulting from completion of the dam construction. In fact, the opposite is true,” Arguello wrote. “There is a risk of environmental injury and loss of human life if dam construction is halted for another two years while Denver Water redesigns the structure of the dam and gets that re-design approved by” the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FERC is involved because of the hydroelectric plant at the base of the dam.

The judge initially shut the project down April 3, saying that the Army Corps and Denver Water had violated the federal Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act when the Gross Reservoir expansion permits were issued in 2017.

Denver Water, which serves 1.5 million people, was not immediately available for comment, but has said previously that it will appeal issues raised in the April 3 injunction.

Save The Colorado, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said Friday morning that it will defend the portion of the Thursday ruling that prevents additional diversion of Colorado River water.

How the case progressed

In her April 3 ruling, Arguello said Denver Water had acted recklessly in proceeding with construction in 2022, knowing that important legal questions were being challenged by Save The Colorado, the Sierra Club and others.

The massive construction project to raise the dam 131 feet and triple the capacity of Gross Reservoir has sparked fierce opposition in Boulder County and prompted several legal challenges from Save The Colorado, a group that advocates on behalf of rivers. Though its early lawsuits failed, the group in 2022 won an appeal that put the legal battle back in play. Despite months of settlement talks, no agreement was reached.

Denver Water first moved to raise Gross Dam more than 20 years ago when the water provider began designing the expansion and seeking the necessary federal and state permits. Denver Water has said raising the dam and increasing capacity of the reservoir is necessary to ensure it has enough water throughout its delivery system and to help with future water supplies as climate change continues to reduce stream flows.

After years of engineering, environmental studies and federal and state analyses, Denver received a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and construction began in 2022.

Arguello’s April 3 ruling said, in part, that the Army Corps should have considered whether ongoing climate change and drought would leave the Colorado River and Western Slope waterways too depleted to safely allow transfer of Denver Water’s rights into a larger Gross Reservoir for Front Range water users.

At the same time, she ordered a permanent injunction prohibiting enlargement of the reservoir, including tree removal and water diversion, and impacts to wildlife.

Almost immediately, Denver Water filed for temporary relief from the order, saying, in part, that it would be unsafe to stop work as the incomplete concrete walls towered above Gross Reservoir.

Arguello granted that request, too, allowing Denver to continue work on the dam considered necessary for safety.

U.S. automakers want to build them here, but they can’t do it without federal subsidies and China’s help. Now, as those subsidies are under the woodchipper, Ford’s joint battery plant with Chinese battery maker CATL in Michigan is on shaky ground. That could spell trouble for its affordable EV plans.

30%: Ford Distressed Over End Of EV Production Credits

Ford’s EV plans are going off the rails. The automaker planned to build a $3.5 billion LFP battery plant in collaboration with Chinese battery juggernaut CATL by licensing its technology, promising some 2,500 jobs and a boost to Michigan’s economy.

After EV sales started growing at a slower pace than once estimated, Ford scaled back the size of the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, reducing the investment to around $2.2 billion and the number of jobs to 1,700. It was initially promised around $1 billion in incentives for the plant—that amount was later slashed by half.

The plant also drew political ire for CATL’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party and suspected human rights violations. Now the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful bill” could gut the manufacturing credits, which would have helped Ford build the plant—that’s if the Senate doesn’t make crucial changes to it before it gets passed.

The executive chairman of the automaker, Bill Ford, is ringing the alarm bells over the potential demise of the manufacturing credits. Here’s more from Automotive News:

“We have built the business case on Marshall around that,” the chairman told reporters after a panel discussion at the Mackinac Policy Conference. “My point is politicians can agree or disagree whether those kind of things are desirable, and that’s fine. But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness, and that’s unfair.”

Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.

“I don’t know the likelihood, but I do know that if it goes away, it puts in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan,” he said.

It’s hard to overstate how crucial low-cost batteries are to bring the price of EVs down to gas-car levels. High purchase price remains the biggest barrier to mainstream EV adoption and LFP batteries offer a real shot at bringing that down.

In China, 81.5% of installed EV battery capacity now comes from LFP cells. Most new EVs are equipped with LFP batteries in the country. And Chinese battery makers like CATL and BYD have rapidly advanced the tech—what was once seen as a low-energy-density option now consistently delivers longer-range EVs.

For Ford, GM, Hyundai, Tesla and others, government subsidies have been key to scaling up local EV and battery production. The manufacturing credits haven’t just created jobs and boosted local economies, they’ve also helped automakers absorb the upfront costs of electrification and could still soften the blow from tariffs.

If Ford’s Michigan battery plant collapses, it would be a major setback for its plans to deliver affordable EVs that are made in America.

60%: Hyundai May Increase Prices Starting Next Week

Photo by: Tim Levin/InsideEVs

If you’ve been EV-shopping lately, you may have noticed that Hyundai and Kia have extensive hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric options to choose from.

Even though most of their new EVs are now manufactured in the U.S. at Hyundai Motor Group’s plants in Georgia, they still use plenty of parts sourced from overseas. With the Trump administration’s blanket 25% tariffs on imported vehicle parts and foreign-made cars, experts have said that car prices could soon increase.

Now Automotive News has reported that Hyundai is considering a 1% price hike across the board starting next week on newly built models. Vehicles currently in the inventory would remain unaffected, but new models could cost hundreds of dollars more.

Here’s more from that report:

“This period marks our regular annual pricing review, guided by market dynamics and consumer demand, independent of tariffs,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to adapt to shifts in supply and demand, and regulations, with a flexible pricing strategy and targeted incentive programs.”

The company had previously said prices would hold through June 2, but automakers are now recalibrating—looking for ways to absorb tariff costs without taking a major hit to profits. Some of that cost burden, it seems, will be paid for by American consumers.

90%: Tesla Breaks Silence On The End Of Energy Tax Credits

Tesla has issued its strongest warning yet against the current administration’s war against clean energy programs. The automaker said ending federal tax credits could deal a major blow to America’s energy independence.

The alarm comes as CEO Elon Musk wraps up his brief but disruptive run as the government’s cost-cutter-in-chief—a move that’s bruised Tesla’s brand and sent its sales and profits into freefall. One outlet phrased it perfectly: the CEO and the company are now on an “image rehab tour.”

Here’s what Tesla Energy posted on X on Thursday:

Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid - we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.

It’s an important point. Tesla isn’t just a car company, it’s also a booming energy business. It sells solar panels and stationary energy storage systems. Sections 25D and 48E under the Inflation Reduction Act have been central in making those things more affordable to regular homeowners—25D is the residential clean energy credit that subsidizes installations such as solar panels, whereas 48E supports businesses who build that equipment, such as Tesla.

Everything that promises cleaner air is under the guillotine with this administration, not just EVs.

100%: Should The Senate Preserve Manufacturing Credits?

Amending the bill to preserve the manufacturing credits would alleviate the financial burden of EV and battery manufacturing, not just for Ford, but also for dozens of other brands and companies upstream and downstream in the EV supply chain.

More importantly, it would allow American car companies to finally build LFP battery cells in the U.S. and truly bring the costs down for EVs—even as they explore alternative chemistries to do the same.

Should lawmakers keep the policies steady after companies have already made billion-dollar bets on clean energy? And can the U.S. realistically make affordable EVs without battery tech like LFP and help from Chinese companies?

Which industries will be most affected if the House bill becomes law?","The Republican-led House of Representatives has narrowly passed a giant tax and spending bill that would end Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for clean power years early.

The proposed changes threaten to unravel a variety of incentives that would result in higher prices for everything from electricity to solar panels.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where it will most likely undergo changes. Here’s what to know about what’s in the passed version of the House bill and how it might change in the Senate.

What are potential economic consequences?

A full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act would cut GDP $1.1 trillion, cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and spike consumer energy bills, according to think tank Energy Innovation Policy & Technology.

While a number of clean energy projects would get canceled if the House bill passes in its current form in the Senate, others would re-negotiate contracts with utilities or corporate offtakers, according to BloombergNEF’s Americas Head Ethan Zindler. “The result would inevitably be higher priced power in substantial parts of the US,” he said.

How does the House bill affect clean energy incentives?

Solar

The cost of installing solar panels on your home would soar under the House bill as it eliminates a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of the year. The legislation also rescinds a 30% tax credit for home battery storage systems. Even if you rent your solar array, the cost is likely to spike as the bill immediately scraps a tax credit for companies like Sunrun that lease systems to homeowners.

“If I could see a knockout punch for solar, it would be if all of a sudden systems got 30% more expensive and payback times got 30% longer,” said Reuben Ly, sales manager for A1 Sun, a family-owned solar installer in Berkeley, California.

Some Republicans in the Senate have objected to the wholesale gutting of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. But if the date of the 17-year-old residential solar tax credit’s demise is uncertain, it seems apparent that its days are numbered, given Republicans’ vow to scuttle the incentive.

So if you’re thinking about going solar, now’s the time to find out if it’s possible to have panels installed by year end.

Heat pumps

If your fossil fuel furnace or water heater is on its last legs, it would be prudent to replace it now with a high-efficiency electric heat pump as the House bill revokes a $2,000 federal tax credit for the devices at the end of the 2025.

Electric vehicles

The $7,500 federal tax rebate for most electric vehicle purchases would end this year instead of 2032. Yet EVs may well maintain much of their momentum. Axing the federal tax credits would cut the EV share of new car sales in 2030 from around 48% to 42%, according to new research from Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.

A large swath of EV buyers don’t qualify for federal rebates anyway, either because they make too much money or buy cars that are priced above payout thresholds. And three out of four buyers who received federal EV rebates would have bought an electric car anyway, according to a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Still, there could be nasty little surprises in the near future. The House bill adds a $250 charge to registration fees for electric vehicles and a similar $100 charge to registration of hybrid vehicles, both designed to make up for lost gasoline tax revenue for non-fossil-fuel vehicles.

Which industries will be most affected if the House bill becomes law?

Solar already is suffering. Shares of Sunrun Inc., America’s biggest rooftop-solar company, fell as much as 42% on May 22 — the most ever in intraday trading. Equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. slid as much as 27%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, slid as much as 10.7%, the most since October 2023.

The House bill represents a “nightmare scenario for US clean energy advocates and defenders of the Biden-era IRA,” BloombergNEF analysts Ethan Zindler and Derrick Flakoll wrote in a May 22 note. The provisions that bar US projects from using components, subcomponents or even materials from China would make it nearly impossible for US solar and battery manufacturers to qualify for the tax incentives, they wrote.

How will investors react?

If passed by the Senate, the repeal of IRA credits would inject “significant regulatory and political risk” and undermine the US’s position as “the world’s leading destination for clean tech capital post-IRA,” said Alex Bibani, a senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in London.

“For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago,” he said. “Project economics, supply chain commitments and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU unless clarity is quickly restored.”

How likely is the Senate to amend the cuts to clean energy incentives?

The Senate is expected to tweak the House’s move to gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, but how much remains an open question.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the Senate plans to write its own version of the bill and several GOP senators said they thought the phase-out of incentives, including for clean electricity and nuclear power, was too aggressive.

But given the House’s slim margin — Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a handful of votes to pass the legislation — major changes in the Senate may not fly.

“The Senate will have a mind of its own,” Senator John Curtis, a Utah Republican who chaired the Conservative Climate Caucus when he served in the House of Representatives, said in an interview. But he added: “We’re also very well aware that it’s a tenuous situation in the House and that will be respected.”

What effect have the clean energy credits had?

Inflation Reduction Act credits have helped drive hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment into manufacturing and wide-spread deployment of solar panels, electric vehicles and other emission reduction technology since the law’s passage in August 2022. Much of that has gone to Republican-leaning areas where labor and land costs tend to be cheaper.

Tax credits from the climate law have led to $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all US private investment in the first quarter of 2025, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation. An additional $522 billion of outstanding investment has been announced across 2,217 facilities, which is expected to create more than 680,000 operational and construction jobs, the research firm said in an analysis.

“Many of these announced investments are at risk of being cancelled if the Reconciliation text is passed as drafted,” the firm said.

What impact could this have on US emissions?

US greenhouse gas emissions peaked in the mid-2000s and have been more or less declining since then — though not nearly as fast as scientists worldwide say is needed to prevent catastrophic levels of global warming. US emissions stayed relatively flat in 2024. One big reason why President Joe Biden and Congress passed the IRA was to help drive down the nation’s emissions more quickly in the next decade.

That progress could be lost by unraveling those polices, leading to more climate pollution. Repealing the energy tax credits, for example, could increase emissions anywhere between at least 500 million metric tons to more than a gigaton in 2035, according to one estimate by the research firm Rhodium Group.

If the measure passes the Senate and is signed into law by President Donald Trump, the $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and $4,000 used-vehicle tax credit incentives on EVs would be killed, along with subsidies for battery manufacturing, the text of the bill says. The EV tax credit, which started during the Obama administration, is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The new provision ""accelerates the expiration to December 31, 2025.""

Ending the clean vehicle tax credit would result in a sharp decrease in EV sales in the U.S., Fix said.

""Once that tax credit goes away, I'm expecting [electric vehicles] to be about 2% of sales,"" Fix said, noting that EVs currently account for around 8% of total car sales in the U.S. ""There will still be electric vehicle sales, Tesla will still survive and [Elon Musk] will do well.

Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer in the U.S., has focused more on selling carbon credits to other automakers than it has on consumer tax incentives. The company, which has moved the bulk of its production to Texas, has also become ""more efficient and effective"" in its manufacturing, according to Fix.

""What Tesla has done, and they don't really care about the $7,500 tax credit, is they were selling carbon credits to all the other car manufacturers,"" Fix said. ""That's where they've made their profits.""

“Under President Trump, the DOE and Secretary Wright are ensuring Americans have access to all forms of reliable energy, including coal,” a Department of Energy spokesperson said.
Still, keeping the Campbell plant in service may not be that easy, said Greg VanWoerkom, a Michigan state representative who represents the area.","The Trump administration’s emergency order last week to extend the life of an aging coal plant that faced permanent closure this weekend is baffling experts and enraging clean-power advocates.

The decree thrust the J.H. Campbell power plant on the shores of Lake Michigan to the fore of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the country’s struggling coal industry. Conservative lawmakers who called for the extension hailed the move as a way to help a Midwest electric system facing occasional stress — and to counteract a years-long shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. The regional grid’s operator, however, said it did not ask for the action to be taken, raising questions on why it was deemed to be so urgent by the Trump administration.

“This is a fake emergency,” says Tyson Slocum, an energy expert with watchdog group Public Citizen, which plans to challenge the order. “This is a political abuse of statutory emergency powers.”

The Campbell plant in West Olive, which first went into service in 1962, has three units with a total of 1.45 gigawatts of capacity. Majority owner Consumers Energy announced plans in 2021 to shut the facility and stop burning coal by this year. The official shutdown date is May 31, but US Energy Secretary Chris Wright upended that plan with an announcement late on May 23, a Friday leading into a three-day holiday weekend.

“I hereby determine that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes,” he wrote in an emergency order.

The decree came as the central US power grid operated by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator heads into summer at an elevated risk of energy shortages during heat waves and other extreme events. Demand for power has been climbing, and stress in the MISO system has building, especially in the Midwest, as utilities shut down coal and natural gas plants to rely more heavily on intermittent wind and solar.

The Energy Department determined that the immediate fix for the crisis was demanding that the Campbell plant stay in service for an additional 90 days, using authority granted by the Federal Power Act.

“Under President Trump, the DOE and Secretary Wright are ensuring Americans have access to all forms of reliable energy, including coal,” a Department of Energy spokesperson said. “For years, American grid operators have warned decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems, including MISO, which has raised alarm bells. This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The CEO of MISO, John Bear, has previously outlined the challenges decarbonization poses to electric reliability. Yet the grid operator and some Michigan authorities seem to dispute whether the extension was essential right now. “MISO did not request the delay but we will coordinate with Consumers Energy to support compliance with the federal order as we prepare to maintain grid reliability throughout the summer season,” said Brandon Morris, a spokesman for the grid operator. “As you know, our recent planning resource auction demonstrated sufficient capacity for the upcoming year.”

No emergency exists, either in Michigan or MISO, according to Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. “We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Scripps said in a statement. “The unnecessary recent order from the US Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.”

The decree was also unusual because the Department of Energy was acting without a formal application for an emergency order, according to Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard Law School’s electricity law initiative.

Typically, “DOE is not looking for emergencies, it is acting on a request,” Peskoe said.

Reviving coal has become a personal issue for Trump, and the order creates the possibility of others being kept alive by decree, said Slocum. “He wants to be the president who saved coal fired power plants,” he said. “This is a political operation.”

The Trump administration made the move to keep the Michigan plant alive as it and Republicans in the House of Representatives have pursued policies that risk weakening renewables — power sources that can often be added to grids faster than new gas-fired plants. Clean power also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change, which is fueling heat waves that place increasing energy demands on grids.

The Energy Department order was preceded by an April 30 letter from seven Michigan state Republican lawmakers warning Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that “we have tremendous concern that Michigan’s energy reliability and security will be irreparably weakened” as power providers shutter coal and gas plants.

The energy landscape has shifted in the years since Consumers Energy said it would close Campbell, said Roger Victory, the Republican state senator who represents the plant’s west Michigan location, and one of the lawmakers who signed the letter. Demand for electricity is climbing, driven by factories and data centers that need reliable power around the clock. That makes facilities like Campbell more important, and shutting them is taxing the grid, raising the risk of power shortages.

“Think of the cost of blackouts,” Victory said in an interview.

In fact, that just happened in Louisiana, where tens of thousands of customers in New Orleans and other parts of the state lost power over Memorial Day weekend. MISO ordered local utility Entergy Corp. to curtail power as high temperatures led to higher-than-expected demand.

Still, keeping the Campbell plant in service may not be that easy, said Greg VanWoerkom, a Michigan state representative who represents the area. Consumers Energy has been planning the shutdown for years. The company has deferred some maintenance, it’s made plans to shift workers to other facilities and shipments of coal have ceased. And while he would be happy to see all those power-plant jobs remain in his district, it may not be practical.

VanWoerkom, a Republican, was aware of the letter his colleagues sent to Washington, but declined to sign it.

“I would love for it to stay open, but it’s a little late in the process,” he said in an interview. “It would require a lot of capital investment to get it to the shape it needs to be.”

Why you should care: The Great Lakes regulate the region's weather and some have suggested it could become a haven for people fleeing other extreme conditions around the country.

""These findings reinforce the critical necessity of accounting for changes in temperature extremes, in addition to long-term warming,"" the study reads.","The Great Lakes have entered a new age of extremes as heat waves and cold snaps push temperatures to new highs and lows, adding stress to the ecosystems it supports and making the region harder to predict.

Adapting to the new reality won't be easy.

Big picture view:

Climate change is driving an increase in heat waves and cold spells on the Great Lakes, with almost every recorded increase in both extremes coming after the mid-1990s.

All five Great Lakes have seen their temperature intensities surge over 100%, with the tipping point coming after an El-Niño in 1997-1998, according to a new study.

While fish populations can respond to changes in water temperatures by migrating to other parts of the lake, rapid shifts in cold or heat can happen too quickly for them to react, leading to large-scale die-offs.

Nuclear power plants become harder to keep cool while ice coverage falls. The temperature extremes also generates conditions for larger algal blooms, while lake stratification - a process that mixes nutrients and increase oxygen levels throughout the water body - also falters.

""We're entering a new era,"" said Dr. Hazem Abdelhady, the lead author of the study, which was published in Communications Earth and Environment.

Dig deeper:

The authors looked at 80 years of extreme temperatures on the Great Lakes for the study. The vast majority of the hottest and coldest days were recorded after 1998,

Not every lake has seen the same extremes, however, with Lake Superior experiencing the largest increase in cold and warm days. The dynamic is tied to a loss of historic ice coverage.

With less ice, the lake is absorbing more radiation from the sun, which causes less ice to form. The feedback loop has been intensifying over the years.

""Lake Superior is stuck in a dangerous cycle,"" said Abdelhady.

The shift toward more heatwaves was most notable from December to May, which is when ice cover historically played a larger role. However, during that same time period, there was also an increase in extreme cold days.

Why you should care:

The Great Lakes regulate the region's weather and some have suggested it could become a haven for people fleeing other extreme conditions around the country.

But the region is not immune from its own dangerous storms. It recorded some of its rainiest years ever recently, while Michigan is in the midst of its most active tornado season ever.

And Abdelhady's study suggests the Great Lakes is experiencing its own temperature extremes as well.

The highest number of heatwaves was in 2012-2013, which followed the most severe round of cold spells on record in 2014-2015. The whiplash makes predicting weather patterns harder. It also means preparing for significant weather events like heavy rainstorms and snowfall.

The modern energy system relies on a variety of energy resources and technologies. Energy resources include fuels to generate electricity and heat, as well as nonferrous minerals, such as those needed in energy technology components. As diversification is key to strengthening the security of an energy system, introducing renewable energy sources to reduce heavy dependence on fossil fuels—the energy transition—has contributed not only to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also to strengthening energy security. Ensuring access to these fuels and technology components for electricity generation and transmission requires robust and transparent supply chains. As such, securing robust and transparent supply chains has become synonymous with safeguarding the energy transition.

The United States has been investing in strengthening the nation’s energy industrial base. The successive U.S. administrations in recent decades have assessed the nation’s energy-related supply chain resilience and undertaken measures to address its vulnerabilities. For example, the first Trump administration (2017–2020) issued the first federal strategy to strengthen critical minerals supply chains, several executive orders related to the supply chains for electric power components, as well as actions such as the issuance of federal support for minerals projects. The supply-chain agenda continues to enjoy bipartisan support from the executive and legislative branches. During the Biden administration (2021–2024), critical minerals were a key focus of a wide-ranging vulnerability assessment that the White House undertook on the state of supply-chain resilience and resultant federal actions. The second Trump administration (2025–present) has already signaled continued strong attention on the availability and access to resources, such as critical minerals and uranium.

Supply-chain security has emerged as a top-tier priority for Washington due to a confluence of global developments. Earlier last decade, Beijing’s increasing assertiveness began raising a policy question on the efficacy of relying on China for materials as important for energy and advanced technologies as critical minerals. The debilitating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy, starting around spring 2021, illuminated the fragility of global supply chains for commodities that are essential for public health and energy resources alike. Adding to these major drivers was Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine in spring 2022. The economic plight—let alone the security challenges—faced by Ukraine and the European economies underscores how energy supplies can be weaponized in a major global conflict, and how energy security and economic security are closely intertwined. The notion of securing the energy supply chains has also gained a geoeconomic driver more recently. The growing demand for energy that is anticipated from running the AI and underlying data centers, together with the electrification trend for decarbonization, requires the expansion and modernization of the electric power grid as well as power plants.

Major Areas of Supply-Chain Challenges and the Existing Bilateral Cooperation

Several energy resources and technologies for a clean energy economy exhibit major vulnerabilities in their supply chains. The following are the top areas where inaction would have energy security, economic, and geopolitical consequences.

Clean Technology Components and Requisite Minerals

The demand for clean energy technologies, such as solar power and electric vehicle (EV) batteries, has been on a growth trajectory. A policy concern is that their global supply chains have a significant level of Chinese presence, where the country accounts for at least 60 percent of their global production capacity. What’s more, the expansion of clean energy technologies is expanding mineral demands, as an energy system powered by clean energy technologies requires more minerals than its fossil fuel-based counterparts. The types of mineral resources used in clean energy technologies vary by technology, but China generally dominates their global supply chains, especially in mineral refining. Notably, the United States is highly dependent on China for many of its official list of critical minerals.

While it is not mineral-rich, Japan is a vital partner in strengthening the critical minerals supply chains, as an off-taker, a source of project finance, downstream manufacturing, as well as a materials research and development (R&D) hub. Japan, along with the European Union, has been a founding partner under the U.S.-EU-Japan Trilateral Conference on Critical Materials. Established in response to soaring prices of some rare earths and critical minerals in 2011, the Trilateral Conference (known as the Conference on Critical Materials and Minerals since June 2021) has advanced information exchange on policies and R&D as well as helped the successful pursuit of a World Trade Organization dispute settlement case in 2014, against China’s export duties and quotas.

Also, Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement in March 2023 that the two countries would not levy export duties on critical minerals they trade. This sectoral trade agreement reflects not only Japan’s interest in accessing tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act but also the U.S. interest in engaging Japan in its friendshoring efforts. For example, Japan and South Korea are currently the only other key sources of EV battery cathode active materials outside China; China accounts for 90 percent of the global capacity, while Japan and South Korea jointly account for the remaining 10 percent.

The two countries cooperate through multilateral fora, too. Under the U.S.-initiated Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), Japan is partnering with a major Congolese entity over minerals development that is tied to a G7-initiated Lobito Corridor railway modernization project in Africa. Under the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, making supply chains diversified, resilient, and transparent was a key objective of its supply chain pillar. Critical minerals and mining, and energy industries (e.g., electric grid technologies, nuclear energy, advanced batteries, and solar and wind components) were two of the sectors that Washington identified for potential cooperation in its August 2024 announcement.

Nuclear-Power Technology and Fuels

Nuclear energy is gaining renewed attention for its non-carbon-emitting attribute. At the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai in 2023, about 30 countries pledged to work towards tripling the installed nuclear power generation capacity by 2050. In the United States, the renewed interest in nuclear—both large and small—comes especially due to the strong forecast for electricity demand from the computational energy requirement of AI. However, a stagnant domestic orderbook over several decades has led to supply-chain challenges, such as the limited capacity in large-scale forging and fabrication. In contrast, Russia leads the world in exporting nuclear power reactors and enriched fuel, while China is set to rival the United States in the installed capacity of domestic, civilian nuclear reactors by 2030.

The resilience of domestic supply chains for nuclear components affects not only the ability to meet the domestic needs for reactor construction, but also the opportunity to capture overseas markets. While most of the global nuclear power plants are in advanced economies today, interest is rising among many in the Global South that currently do not have a nuclear power generation program. What is at stake is not merely economics, as nuclear commerce helps maintain or expand ties between technology supplier and importer countries.

Nuclear energy has long been a key area of bilateral cooperation, involving national R&D institutions. Under the first Trump administration, the two governments reinforced the commitment. The ongoing interests and investments in U.S. reactor projects—both public and private—from Japanese utility and engineering companies demonstrate Japan’s importance as a close partner. Multilaterally, Japan has been contributing actively to the U.S. efforts to promote small modular nuclear globally, such as that under the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, while also joining forces with the United States in striving to diversify the global supply chains for nuclear fuels under the Sapporo 5, a multilateral initiative launched at Japan’s G7 energy ministerial in 2023.

Electric Grid System

The electric power system is another area of supply chain challenges. Growing electricity demand from both decarbonization and AI and datacenter operational purposes points to a significant requirement for additional power supply. This means that the nation will need more grid components, such as transformers and equipment like switchgear, as well as transmission lines in the coming years. However, the U.S. ability to meet the requirement is severely constrained. The limited capacity for domestic production has rendered the replacement lead times for large power transformers to more than double between 2021 and 2024.

Moreover, our modern electricity system is increasingly reliant on information and communications technology (ICT). Therefore, the risk of cyberattacks has become one of the paramount concerns. Cyber risks to the electric power system can arise not only from direct attacks aimed at the critical infrastructure, but also through exploitation of vulnerabilities in the component supply chains, including insertion of counterfeits and insertion of malicious software.

Supply-chain resilience for these components and infrastructure has become a national security concern, not only for its high import dependence (80 percent in 2019) but also for its reliance on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Japan, with its significant expertise in material science, is a key supplier of critical materials, such as high-grade grain-oriented electrical steel, which is a key raw material for large power transformers. On the ICT supply-chain front, Washington and Tokyo have begun consulting closely, including through the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on Digital Economy.

A Way Forward

Advancing an objective as strategic as securing these energy supply chains is most effective when pursued in partnership with countries that have a shared assessment of the nature and urgency of the challenge, as well as the technological and industrial capacity to address them. Japan is head above the rest. Cooperation with Japan will significantly enhance U.S. efforts to secure these supply chains, given the strong synergies between the two countries.

Clean Energy Technology

While clean energy does not enjoy a high-level focus under the Trump administration, some of the technologies continue to merit strong government focus as they provide security as well as decarbonization benefits. While the effort to reduce the China dependence in the supply chains for established technologies may continue to merit, Washington and Tokyo should consider dedicating a sizable share of their joint efforts also towards clean energy technologies that are still in their early stage.

Hydrogen fuel cells and electrolyzers are one such category of technologies. Fuel cells can provide a reliable (and backup) power supply from hydrogen on-site, either for civilian and non-civilian applications. Also, electrolyzer technology is key to producing cleaner hydrogen by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. In particular, the global supply chains for proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies are still in the nascent stage. PEM technology may be more complex, yet more compatible with intermittent renewables than alkaline-based technologies, where China already leads in global manufacturing capacity.

Due to their nascency, policy support and industry actions are likely to effectuate PEM technology supply chains which have more diversity, robustness, and resilience that are lacking in many other clean tech supply chains today. The U.S.-Japan cooperation should consider a consultative platform to ensure that their innovation outcomes are successfully scaled up for manufacturing and mass production within the West. The two countries could also engage like-minded countries, such as the European Union, to jointly formulate measures to nurture the technology supply chains that are resilient against the potential inflow of components due to overcapacity problems in China.

Critical Minerals

The second Trump administration has signaled a significant commitment to expanding the domestic capacity in minerals production. This will likely encompass more expansive use of federal financing tools, including for engagement of resource-rich foreign countries. Multilaterally, Washington and Tokyo should continue to leverage existing platforms, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), to effectively infuse competitiveness, sustainability, and transparency in their global supply chains.

Such potential was already evident as the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order directed the secretary of state to “consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.” Moreover, Japan may consider serving as the MSP chair in the coming years, while the two countries can also guide the minerals security agenda for the IEA. Bilaterally, the United States may consider partnering with Japan to raise additional capital to support the development of mineral production capacity at home that, in turn, accords Japan access to U.S. mineral supplies in times of supply disruptions.

Nuclear-Power Technology and Fuels

Nuclear energy is among the domestic energy priorities for the Trump administration. With its continued expertise in large-scale forging and fabrication, Japan would be a natural ally for the United States, as the U.S. power sector strives to meet the requirement for component supplies for refurbishing or replacing large reactors. Meanwhile, U.S. developers of small modular reactors and advanced reactors may find engineering and construction partners in the Japanese nuclear industry, especially as the U.S. vendors eye emerging nuclear markets with limited local industrial capacity.

Moreover, Washington could work closely with Japan in instilling diversity and robustness in the global supply chains for nuclear fuels. Potential measures may include Japan’s investment in the new U.S. fuel production capacity, including for High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium fuel that is needed for advanced reactors in development. Such engagement would mean additional capital for the U.S. effort as well as an alternate supply source to enhance Japan’s nuclear fuel supply security. The two governments should also consult on how they may further leverage the Sapporo 5 framework.

Electric Grid System

Securing the grid system supply chains is an important task not only to meet the future volumetric requirement, but also to safeguard our modern electric network from exploitation of vulnerabilities in technology components. Washington should consider strategic partnerships with Tokyo and others with production capacities that are geopolitically aligned.

For example, the Japanese component supplies can help fill the U.S. supply gap, as U.S. utilities strive to meet the growing demand for these grid components. Another idea is for the Japanese manufacturers to invest in the United States to help augment the supply chain resilience.

As Chinese components are generally much cheaper than their competitors, Washington may consider providing support, such as the Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities. In fact, while the use of DPA for energy technology components as promulgated by the Biden administration was rescinded in March 2025, the DPA use for transformers appears to have been left intact. Washington and Tokyo should explore paths towards closer supply-chain engagement over critical electric grid components, such as transformers.

Lacey Mayor Peter Curatolo said the bill would eliminate township officials from the approval process.

LACEY -- A new bill under consideration by New Jersey lawmakers could cut municipal and county officials out of the process to approve new small-scale nuclear energy facilities.

The bill, S4423, would make the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities able to authorize construction of small modular nuclear reactors, without approval from municipal or county authorities, in towns that currently or at one time had nuclear plants.

The rule would only apply to two municipalities in New Jersey: Lacey and Lower Alloways Creek in Salem County. Lower Alloways Creek is home to the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants.

In Lacey, the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station stopped producing electricity in 2018. The facility is being decommissioned by a division of Holtec International, which is also working to develop a small modular reactor prototype.

The New Jersey bill, if approved, would permit small modular reactor operators to store nuclear waste on the property until a permanent national repository is approved. The bill would also direct the Board of Public Utilities to provide financial incentives for the development of these new variety of reactors.

""With rising utility prices and increasing demand for electricity as we pursue electrification, New Jersey needs to increase our production capacity without worsening climate change with new fossil fuel burning facilities,"" state Sen. Robert Smith, D-Middlesex, said in a news release. Smith is the bill's primary sponsor and chair of the state Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

""Properly regulated nuclear power is reliable, safe and most importantly does not emit greenhouse gases,"" he said.

Lacey Mayor Peter Curatolo said he opposed the portion of the bill that would cut township authorities out of the decision-making process.

""It's important for us to have home rule and to be the final determinant for land use as the local authority having jurisdiction,"" he said by phone.

Small modular reactors, or SMRs, are nuclear fission reactors that generate 300 megawatts or less of electricity, or about a third of the power of a traditional nuclear reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

As a result of their smaller scale, these reactors rely on passive systems that would not require human intervention or external power to shut down in case of an emergency, according to the agency. They could also be manufactured at a facility, then pieced together at another location at lower cost than the construction of traditional nuclear facilities, according to the energy agency.

""These increased safety margins, in some cases, eliminate or significantly lower the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity to the environment and the public in case of an accident,"" agency officials wrote on their website about small modular reactors.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling on the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to speed up the approval process for the nation's first SMRs, other small-scale reactor models and new kinds of nuclear facilities. The secretary is also charged with streamlining the environmental review process for nuclear energy projects.

""It is the policy of my Administration to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies into domestic production as soon as possible,"" the president wrote in his order.

In 2023, 42% of the electricity produced in New Jersey came from nuclear sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas plants produced nearly half of the state's electricity, according to the agency.

Curatolo, the Lacey mayor, said he supports the creation of SMRs, but wants township officials to have a voice in the process.

""I do believe small modular reactors are the future and make the most sense for the economy,"" he said. ""They will produce energy for us. And I believe in the technology, and I believe it is the future, and that we could do it well here in Lacey Township.""

Gretchen Whitmer to take further action to stop the Line 5 pipeline tunnel.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found multiple ""direct, detrimental effects"" that would be caused to land, groundwater and surface water by the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline tunnel proposal.

Many of the environmental impacts would be alleviated after the tunnel's construction, the Army Corps found.

A 3.6-mile tunnel proposed for construction beneath the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom to house a new oil and gas pipeline would cause ""direct, detrimental effects"" such as loss of trees, wetlands and other habitat; underwater and surface water disturbances; potential loss of archeological features and potentially years of snarled traffic in the area, a draft environmental impact statement released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finds.

But most of the detrimental effects of the project proposed by Canadian oil transport giant Enbridge would occur only during the tunnel's construction, and would lessen or alleviate afterward, according to the Army Corps study released May 30.

The report arrives with controversy. The Army Corps announced in April it would expedite its review of the contentious pipeline tunnel project to comply with President Donald Trump's energy emergency executive order. Critics of the move contend a project of the scope and potential long-term magnitude of the pipeline tunnel, in the area where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron connect, should be careful and deliberative.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and cost more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom would be greatly more devastating.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom. Enbridge officials have said that placing the pipeline in a tunnel beneath the Straits lessens risks and potential impacts.

Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy called the draft environmental impact statement release by the Army Corps of Engineers ""a significant milestone in the development of the Great Lakes Tunnel ... a project that will modernize energy infrastructure, protect the Great Lakes, and ensure long-term energy reliability for Michigan and the broader region.""

Enbridge officials push back on the notion that evaluation of the project has been rushed or less than comprehensive.

The draft environmental impact study ""is the result of more than five years of rigorous and comprehensive permit review and stakeholder engagement,"" Duffy said.

'Direct, detrimental effects are probable' during construction

The Army Corps' environmental impact examined multiple scenarios: Enbridge's pipeline and tunnel plan; a do-nothing alternative; a proposal to keep the existing pipelines operating on the Straits lake bottom but put a protective cover of rocks and gravel over them; and three different decommissioning alternatives to stop operation of the more than 70-year-old twin pipelines on the Straits bottom, one option leaving the pipes in place, others removing portions of the pipelines.

The Corps study found Enbridge's tunnel plan would disturb and remove 19 acres of vegetation, including the clearing of more than 5 acres of forested land and nearly 5 acres of permanent wetlands loss.

Direct, detrimental impacts to groundwater would occur for the duration of shaft and portal construction, expected to last six and eight months, respectively, and while the tunnel boring machine was in operation, the Army Corps found. Groundwater aquifers would be drawn down by 2 feet in a 360-foot radius during shaft and portal construction, but testing indicates the aquifer ""would recover within a few days of (tunnel boring machine) operations in a given location,"" the study states.

Potential negative impacts to groundwater quality from drilling fluid releases, contaminants from onshore materials storage and the use of heavy equipment are also possible. ""The associated impacts would end following construction,"" the report states.

Surface water impacts include that ""approximately 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid (water and bentonite) would be released"" during installation of a water intake structure and pipe for the tunnel project, the Army Corps report states. ""Approximately 31.4 acres total ground disturbance would occur within proposed construction footprints, which could result in direct, detrimental impacts to surface waters adjacent to construction footprints due to erosion and sedimentation,"" the study additionally finds.

Noise and vibration during tunnel installation, along with blasting, could impact area recreation and both land and aquatic animals, but would cease after tunnel construction, the study finds.

A tunnel construction would bring 162 daily truck roundtrips to the south side of the Straits of Mackinac and another 120 daily truck roundtrips to the north side, which the Army Corp found ""would increase traffic safety risks and degrade level of service on public roadways — ""especially during the peak commuting hours and peak recreational seasons and holidays. Direct, detrimental effects are probable and would occur throughout the construction period (approximately 6 years) which would end following construction.""

Environmental groups call on Whitmer for help

Environmental groups are calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to take further action to stop the Line 5 pipeline tunnel.""The laws protecting the Great Lakes are not up for debate. For years, it’s been clear state and federal permits are being crafted with forgone conclusions that provide yet another handout to Big Oil,"" said Beth Wallace, Great Lakes climate and energy director for the environmental nonprofit National Wildlife Federation's Ann Arbor office.

""Governor Whitmer and Michigan officials have a duty to protect the Great Lakes, which are held in public trust for all. This is why the State of Michigan has to require a full review of risk to our bottomlands, under the Submerged Lands Act. This is not just about Line 5. A failure to fully consider this project will not only put our economy and the drinking water for millions at risk to drilling spills and explosions, it also opens the door for other oil corporations to follow suit.""

The bottomlands of the Straits belong to the people of Michigan, not to Enbridge, and it is the state’s duty to act on its residents' behalf, said Ashley Rudzinski, climate and environment program director at the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, a nonprofit organization based in Traverse City.

""That means requiring a full, independent review of the proposed drilling and blasting of the Great Lakes bottomlands — not rubber-stamping a project that serves corporate profits over public good,"" she said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Detroit District will hold two virtual public meetings from 1-4 p.m. on Wednesday, June 18; and 5-8 p.m. on Wednesday, July 25 to allow the public to learn more about the potential impacts from the various alternatives and provide feedback. Public comments will be accepted on the draft environmental impact study through June 30, and can be made at https://www.line5tunneleis.com/comment-here-new/ or by mail to: Line 5 Tunnel EIS, 16501 Shady Grove Road, P.O.

Nonetheless, clean energy has become politicised amid broad pushback against net-zero policies and a presidential promise to “drill, baby, drill”.","Total installed US solar PV, energy storage and wind power capacity, after the 7.4GW of new power, reached over 320GW as of the end of March, ACP said. Utility-scale solar led the Q1 additions by far, with 4.46GW of new capacity added compared with 1.6GW of energy storage and 1.3GW of onshore wind capacity.

Perhaps more notable than the new additions, ACP said that the national renewable energy project pipeline grew 12% year-on-year in Q1 2025, reaching 184.4GW. The energy storage pipeline, in particular, grew by 57%. If everything in the pipeline is built, ACP said it will represent US$328 billion in project investment.

It noted that projects included in this figure are “typically” fully permitted projects, and that the growth of the pipeline does not indicate growth in the number of projects receiving permits. However, ACP’s announcement said: “These market-driven investments reflect growing demand for reliable, affordable domestic energy from utilities and major American companies.”

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale. With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet. “We have the technology, investment capital, and workforce required to build the US$300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline. The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Republican states

Of the ten states which installed the most capacity in Q1, eight voted Republican in the November presidential election, ACP said. Texas, Florida and Indiana, all of which are red states, led Q1 installations, with the former far outstripping any other state and growing by 20% to reach over 80GW of cumulative capacity.

ACP’s report said: “The industry’s growth is particularly strong in Republican-leaning states, where domestic manufacturing and energy production has created nearly 650,000 direct and indirect jobs and generates US$3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and payments to landowners in rural communities.”

Since coming to power, Donald Trump’s Republican administration has set about broadly attacking the federal incentives for clean energy production and manufacturing introduced by the previous government. Most recently, a bill which passed the US House of Representatives proposes to effectively end the 30% investment and production tax credits (ITC/PTC) for clean energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by imposing a 60-day deadline for any project to receive federal credits.

Many in the renewables industries – particularly solar PV, which has become the leading source of new US electricity capacity – have pointed to the positive benefits that Republican states have seen off the back of IRA tax credits. Much of the roughly 50GW of US solar module manufacturing capacity now operational is in broadly Republican states like Texas, Ohio and Georgia.

Nonetheless, clean energy has become politicised amid broad pushback against net-zero policies and a presidential promise to “drill, baby, drill”.

The renewable energy industry currently faces a potential repeal of tax credits as part of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” which narrowly passed the House of Representatives and now heads to the Senate for approval.

If approved, the new budget would effectively eliminate tax credits for all renewable energy projects not placed in service by 2028.

Utility-scale solar projects often take years to progress from early development to construction and activation, and equipment providers are sounding the alarm to secure tax-credit eligible components before the budget is passed.

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project’s total capital expenditures were incurred before new legislative changes take effect.

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of business development for PV Hardware USA, a solar tracker provider.

Two critical project-level tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act will be repealed if the budget passes the Senate as currently written. This includes the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC).

The ITC is a project-level credit that covers 30% of the cost of an installed project. This credit is offered to projects of any size, from utility-scale power plants to homeowners and small businesses installing solar on their rooftops.

The PTC is a generation-side tax credit, crediting emissions-free electricity generators generally between 0.3 cents per kWh to 1.5 cents per kWh.

PV Hardware said it is ready to support solar tracker procurement before the legislative changes take effect. The company said it has over 5 GW of safe harbor product that can help developers meet the capital expenditure requirements to qualify for the tax credits.

“We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics,” said Bitar. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

The budget bill is expected to have devastating effects on the renewable energy industry if passed as-is. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the bill could jeopardize nearly 300 U.S.-based solar and storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 GWh of solar generation by 2030.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, SEIA.",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/05/pexels-kindel-media-9875449-2048x1536-1-1200x900.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 14:27:39.732142

A recent Fifth Circuit decision has eased the path for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delegate authority to state agencies to issue and enforce Class VI injection well permits, a key permit needed for most carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects.

In Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, a group of NGOs had challenged the Biden administration’s 2024 decision to grant Louisiana Class VI permitting authority — referred to as “primacy” under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the case after concluding that the groups lacked either organizational or associational standing. First, the court determined that petitioners “cannot manufacture its own standing” by alleging that the primacy approval forced them to divert time and resources that would otherwise go towards the group’s other activities. The court also determined that petitioners lacked associational standing on behalf of its individual members, finding that they could not satisfy the imminence or traceability requirements of Article III.

Among other things, petitioners challenged the liability transfer mechanism in Louisiana’s CCS legislation. This mechanism requires CCS operators to pay into a trust fund throughout the course of injection operations, and in exchange the state assumes long-term responsibility and liability for the facility after closure if certain technical requirements are met and the trust is adequately funded. See L.R.S. § 30:1109. Petitioners alleged that its members would face future harm if an incident occurred after a state transfer because they could receive reduced compensation from a state fund as compared to a private operator. Emphasizing that the Louisiana provision acts as a liability transfer, not a liability waiver, the court concluded that petitioners’ theory “stretches attenuation and speculation far beyond their breaking points.”

The ruling comes at a time when states and the EPA have shown increased interest in states efficiently obtaining primacy over Class VI wells. For example, EPA has removed expectations that Class VI state regulatory packages include explicit consideration of environmental justice, which, under the Biden administration EPA had led to delays in EPA approvals. Nine states are currently in the process of applying for Class VI primacy (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah).

What action is the District taking?

The Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District is opening a public comment period June 1, 2025, regarding an RFG Opt-Out Request Including a Non-Interference Demonstration for the Kentucky Counties of Jefferson, Bullitt, and Oldham.

Summary of proposal

The Governor of Kentucky has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requesting to opt-out of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program in the Louisville RFG Area, which includes Jefferson County, as well as parts of Bullitt and Oldham Counties. If approved, Jefferson, Bullitt, and Oldham Counties would no longer be required to use reformulated gasoline, a type of fuel originally developed to burn cleaner than conventional gasoline.

Kentucky opted into the RFG program in the 1990s in an effort to improve air quality and meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, conventional gasoline has significantly improved and the difference between RFG and conventional gas has narrowed.

The District is requesting EPA’s approval of its proposed Non-Interference Demonstration showing that the removal of RFG will not impact the area’s ability to meet air quality standards, as the area will be replacing the emission reduction benefit from RFG with permanent, enforceable emission reductions due to the closure of LG&E Mill Creek Unit 1.

How can I comment on this action?

You can comment in writing using the online public comment form(link is external), or by mail to Regulatory Coordinator, Lauren Robbins, Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District, 701 W. Ormsby Ave., Suite 303, Louisville, Kentucky 40203, until 5:00 p.m., July 2, 2025. Verbal statements will be accepted at a public hearing, if one is requested, via Video Teleconference, with an option to attend in the Edison Room of the Edison Center at 701 West Ormsby Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40203, on Wednesday, July 2, 2025, at 6:00 PM.

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced the implementation of emergency permitting procedures to expeditiously review geothermal energy projects critical for U.S. national security and Energy Dominance. This action is part of the Department’s efforts to address the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025.

By streamlining environmental reviews, the Department aims to accelerate geothermal projects that address urgent national security and energy needs while maintaining environmental stewardship.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

Several proposed geothermal projects led by Ormat Nevada, Inc. will be among the first geothermal projects covered by the Department’s new emergency permitting procedures:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada) – Ormat plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased land to determine whether the geothermal reservoir is commercially viable.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada) – This effort involves upgrading and expanding three existing geothermal power plants by adding new wells, advanced heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 MW solar photovoltaic field. These improvements aim to increase efficiency and boost output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada) – Ormat is evaluating geothermal potential on leased public lands through test drilling and exploration activities.

These proposed projects pursue the kind of reliable and strategically important energy development the Department seeks to accelerate—supporting both national defense and domestic energy resilience. Once the Bureau of Land Management completes its environmental assessments within a 14-day timeframe, it will determine whether Ormat’s proposed projects can move forward.

The Bureau of Land Management oversees geothermal development on federal lands by leasing sites to companies, conducting environmental reviews, and issuing permits for exploration and production. The bureau ensures projects comply with environmental and safety standards, balances geothermal development with other land uses and manages royalties from operations. Essentially, BLM manages and regulates geothermal resources to promote responsible energy development on public lands.

The Department is using emergency authorities under existing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act. Interior has prepared a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the emergency procedures. Project proponents interested in requesting emergency coverage should contact their regular points of contact at the pertinent field, district or state office.

So far the Trump administration has publicly announced plans to fire nearly 300 staff working on DEI or environmental justice issues at the end of July. These records show that a major reorganization has already taken place at the agency behind the scenes.

“The EPA can’t protect American health while losing 10% of its staff in a matter of months. And more firings are planned by the Trump administration,” said Ivan Ditmars, associate attorney at the Center. “Without the scientists and researchers to maintain strong health and environmental standards, polluters will profit while the rest of us suffer from dirtier air and water. As Trump stops policing pollution, we can expect more asthma attacks, lead contamination and all the other harms that EPA experts strive to prevent.”

EPA records show a list of more than 17,700 employees in 2024, compared to nearly 16,200 employees at the end of April. The agency has not revealed which divisions have been most affected by the staff reductions.

Other estimates of the EPA’s staffing numbers have focused on its “core workforce” but the new records appear to cover much or all of the agency’s entire staff.

The speed of the almost 10% cut in staffing is unprecedented. Past declines under Reagan, Bush and the first Trump administration were much more gradual.

“Past cuts hurt the EPA a lot, but at least they occurred slowly enough that the agency had time to adapt. Trump is now pushing people out in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible,” Ditmars said.

That’s because the U.S. power sector is a major source of climate pollution.
The 3% problem Section 111 of the Clean Air Act doesn’t set a threshold above which sectors are deemed to contribute “significantly” to climate pollution.
In other words, the U.S. power sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the national emissions of most countries.
“This is a matter of statutory interpretation,” said Joe Goffman, who served as EPA air chief in the Biden administration.","EPA is expected to soon argue that the U.S. power sector doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change — a bid that could give the agency cover to not regulate planet-warming emissions from a wide range of sources.

EPA included the argument in its draft repeal of Biden-era rules to limit pollution from power plants, according to two people briefed by EPA personnel and granted anonymity to discuss those conversations. The agency bolsters its argument by stating in the draft sent to the White House that U.S. fossil fuel power plants account for 3 percent of global emissions, The New York Times reported last week.

The assertion would take advantage of a section of the Clean Air Act that instructs the EPA administrator to decide whether a category of sources contributes enough harmful pollution to warrant regulation. That could offer a backdoor avenue for EPA to stop regulating most climate pollution — one where the agency has to clear a lower legal bar than overturning the so-called endangerment finding that underpins all Clean Air Act climate regulations.

Industry attorneys who have expressed skepticism about the Trump administration’s broader assault on climate science see some merit in a more targeted approach under Section 111.

“We’ve been telling folks for a while that we thought it was easier for them to make a run at the power sector or the oil and gas sector than the vehicle sector, just because of the word ‘significantly’ in the statute,” said Jeff Holmstead, who served as EPA air chief under former President George W. Bush.

But if EPA’s bid to label power plants as insignificant contributors to harmful pollution survives the inevitable legal challenges, it could absolve the agency from regulating a wide range of stationary emissions sources under Section 111.

That’s because the U.S. power sector is a major source of climate pollution. Declaring that it doesn’t contribute “significantly” to pollution could rule out regulation of any source category that emits less pollution — which would be nearly all of them.

“If the courts agree that greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector do not ‘significantly contribute’ to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare, then this would prevent EPA from regulating greenhouse emissions from any industrial sector,” said Holmstead.

Transportation would be a notable exception. It emits more and is regulated under a different section of the law, so the move wouldn’t affect tailpipe emissions rules.

If the courts agree with EPA’s proposed threshold for what constitutes a “significant” contribution, that could also create hurdles for future administrations, experts said.

“They may well get a judicial decision on what it means to contribute significantly under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act,” said Jonathan Adler, a conservative legal scholar and founding director of Case Western Reserve University’s environmental law center. “That would potentially lock that in place. Not just for power plants, but arguably for other stationary source categories.”

Coal- and gas-fired power plants released 31 percent of domestic CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion in 2023, according to EPA’s own emissions inventory, which the Environmental Defense Fund released this month after obtaining it via a Freedom of Information Act request. That’s more than any other source category except transportation.

EPA’s inventory showed that industrial energy use collectively accounted for 26.3 percent of CO2 from fossil fuels combustion in 2023 — a significant share of emissions but less than the power sector.

The 3% problem

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act doesn’t set a threshold above which sectors are deemed to contribute “significantly” to climate pollution.

The New York Times’ reporting hints that EPA may be preparing to propose “3 percent of global emissions” as that threshold, but experts agree that the agency would need to give a strong justification for choosing that as the cutoff.

Only six economies emit more than 3 percent of global emissions, comprising China, the United States, India, the European Union, Russia and Brazil. In other words, the U.S. power sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the national emissions of most countries.

EPA also has the challenge of seeking to introduce this threshold — for the first time in the Clean Air Act’s 50-year history — a year after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision to sharply limit the degree of deference courts afford to agencies in interpreting vaguely worded statutes. The Loper Bright v. Raimondo decision upended a decades-old legal precedent known as the Chevron doctrine that directed courts to give agencies the benefit of the doubt in their “reasonable” interpretations of laws when Congress’ intent was unclear.

“This is a matter of statutory interpretation,” said Joe Goffman, who served as EPA air chief in the Biden administration. “I think at least in passing, they will regret the demise of Chevron deference.”

Holmstead noted that EPA would benefit from statutory language that instructs the EPA administrator to decide “in his judgment” whether a source category contributes significantly to harmful pollution.

Robert Sussman, who served as senior policy counsel at EPA during the Obama administration, said that EPA would also need to explain a rule from Trump’s first term — which was never implemented — that sought to make 3 percent of domestic greenhouse gas emissions the threshold for a finding of significant contribution under Section 111.

That’s a much lower bar than 3 percent of global emissions, and EPA said explicitly at the time that the power sector qualified as contributing significantly.

“They would need to demonstrate why the rule that they themselves promulgated in the first term no longer represents their thinking,” Sussman said.

The Trump EPA’s strategy on endangerment shows it trying to avoid a frontal assault on climate science, relying instead on “a fairly narrow legal formulation that they can apply without much effort,” said Sussman.

The administration hasn’t devoted any time to building an alternative scientific record to support its bid to overturn the foundational scientific finding — as it considered doing during Trump’s first term. Less than a month after inauguration day, EPA sent the White House recommendations for upending the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding, which declared that greenhouse gas emissions endangered public health and welfare. The power plant repeal proposal followed a couple of months later.

But Sussman said the agency would need to provide analysis based on science for the criteria it proposes for sources that “contribute significantly.”

“They will actually have to, I think, get into the science of climate change here in order to have an intelligent position on what is a ‘significant contribution,’” he said. “If you just pick a number out of the air — like 3 percent — how can that number be meaningful without regard to the context of the pollution problem that you’re trying to address?”

Environmental lawyers see another statutory problem. EPA has always considered all the pollution from a source category — like power plants or oil refineries — when interpreting Section 111. That means the agency might have to argue that U.S. power plants don’t contribute significantly to any harmful pollution, not just planet-warming emissions, to undo its 1971 decision to list fossil fuel power plants under Section 111.

“Administratively, this is a through line of EPA’s interpretation,” said Patrick A. Parenteau, a senior fellow of climate policy in the Environmental Law Center at Vermont Law School.

The Biden EPA did discuss the greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants as part of the carbon rule it finalized last year. It stated the sector was responsible for 4 percent of global heat-trapping emissions, based on 2021 data. But Goffman said that information was included at EPA’s discretion, not because Section 111 required a separate significant contribution finding for power plant carbon emissions.

But Holmstead said courts have never weighed in on whether that EPA interpretation is the best reading of the statute. And he said he thought the Trump administration was right to argue — as it likely will — that the statute requires a dedicated finding for each pollutant, not just for source categories.

“It doesn’t make any sense to say that EPA can regulate any pollutant that it wants, even if there’s no sense in regulating it,” he said. “I don’t always agree with the legal positions of this administration, but I think they’re right on this one.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2d/fd/cff4321740ce8ab15d93341ced5c/trump-epa-coal-ash-66474.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:24.777011

The tunnel project, fast-tracked by the Trump administration, aims to house the Line 5 pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac.

Great Lakes tribes and environmental groups oppose the project, citing concerns about the aging pipeline's safety and potential environmental impact.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a long-awaited draft of its environmental review for Enbridge's Line 5 Tunnel project through the Straits of Mackinac.

Although the draft is not an official decision, it gives the an idea of how the agency views the project. The Corps is accepting public comments through June with a decision expected in the fall.

The Great Lakes Tunnel Project was fast-tracked earlier this spring as a part of the Trump administration's goal to ""unleash"" American oil and gas. Canadian-headquartered Enbridge has proposed to build a tunnel to house its Line 5 pipeline through the 4 1/2 mile stretch separating Lakes Michigan and Huron.

The Army Corps' Detroit District, which is overseeing the permitting process, said it will not eliminate any steps in the environmental review process. But Great Lakes tribes and environmental groups remain unconvinced that the aged-out pipeline can continue to operate safely through the world's largest surface freshwater system.

Several Great Lakes tribes withdrew as cooperating agencies in the review process, saying that the federal agency was not acting in good faith. Tribal leaders claimed the process lacked meaningful dialogue and undermined the federal government’s responsibility to protect tribal treaty rights.

The draft spans hundreds of pages, evaluating the necessity of the proposed project and examining potential environmental impacts while also reviewing possible alternatives. It considered two main alternatives, which included denying permits and allowing the existing pipeline to operate under the Straits as is, or placing a protective cover over the portions that are currently exposed. It also considered changing the tunnel's design and decommissioning the pipeline entirely.

Officials from the Corps concluded that the project is warranted, citing projections that demand for the petroleum products transported by the pipeline will either remain stable or grow over the next 25 years.

The tunnel will be bored upwards of 250 feet under the lakebed

Over the years in the Straits of Mackinac, Line 5 has experienced anchor strikes, missing supports and coating loss, exposing patches of bare metal.

The tunnel became possible after a review by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who in his final month of office when he created the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority. The corridor authority signed 99-year lease agreement with Enbridge to continue operations of the Line 5 tunnel. Enbridge has said the Great Lakes Tunnel will nearly eliminate the risks of a pipeline incident.

The tunnel will be bored into rock 60 to 250 feet under the lakebed, using a tunnel boring machine that will move the tunnel forward 40 feet per day on average. It will be constructed the south side of the Straits to the northern shores, which Enbridge says minimizes environmental impacts.

The tunnel will be owned and operated by Michigan, and leased to the company.

Great Lakes tribes, environmentalists argue risks are too great

The Great Lakes Tunnel Project also needs two state permits, one from Michigan’s Public Service Commission and the other from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. Enbridge has secured the permit from the public service commission, but must redo the permitting process with the environment and energy agency given new information on nearby wetlands.

The permit from the state public service commission was challenged by tribes, but that challenge was struck down earlier this year. On April 2, tribes and environmental groups asked the state Supreme Court to consider overturning the lower court's decision.

Line 5 opponents have long worried about the risks the pipeline poses to the Great Lakes. The pipeline, which was built in 1953, was built to last 50 years, and leaked 35 times during its tenure. Environmentalists and Great Lakes tribes warn of risks at the Straits of Mackinac, which is seen as the worst place in the region for an oil spill and sacred to Anishinaabe tribes. They also cite threats to nearby wetlands and explosion risks within the tunnel.

The Line 6 oil spill that occurred late last year in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, has heightened these fears.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an international think tank, released a report earlier this year that said that shutting down the pipeline would be a more cost-effective avenue for the company as that the tunnel will likely cost three times the initial estimate due to inflation and rising costs.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/19/PMJS/83729203007-mjs-enbridge-3.jpg?crop=8493,4777,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 12:24:30.381658

These new battery chemistries often require multiple stages of coating, cutting and handling. For example, solid-state electrode production involves coating a base material with active components, followed by a second layer of insulating material. This layered structure offers enhanced performance but also introduces more friction-heavy processing steps, each of which risks introducing particulate contamination. The presence of static charge further exacerbates this, as it causes particles to be attracted to sensitive surfaces, where they can become embedded and difficult to remove.

“Process engineers are under pressure to optimise both the chemistry and efficiency of these emerging technologies” said Ian Atkinson, board member and sales director at Meech International. “But they’re not always specialists in static and contamination control - so problems can occur before they're even recognised.”

Contamination at sub-micron levels can affect stacking accuracy, reduce cycle life, and even compromise safety. In some cases, electrostatic charge builds up on insulating materials or carrier films, leading to sticking, misalignment, and reduced line speeds in automated processes.

Meech recommends integrating advanced surface cleaning and static control measures as early as possible in the design and production process. For example, technologies that use airflow dynamics to extract particles below 1 μm without touching the substrate are already being adopted by major manufacturers.

These systems maintain pristine surface conditions throughout high-speed production lines while minimising waste and eliminating the need for inconsistent or manual interventions.

And you, what do you think of the stop-start system?","The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has spoken, and what was once an open secret now makes much more sense: stop-start systems in cars are useless. No, they’re not useful, they were supposedly designed to reduce fuel consumption when the car is idle but, let’s be honest, they’re pretty annoying.

Now, the Trump administration has launched a crusade against these systems, which have been added to cars for more than 15 years. The EPA argues that they provide little or no real benefit in terms of emissions and that all they really do is wear down engine components.

What stop-start systems were supposed to promise

The idea was simple: eliminate fuel consumption during idling (when the car is stopped but still on, like at traffic lights or yield signs), especially in urban environments.

This practice became popular in the early 2000s, when the U.S. Department of Energy and Argonne National Laboratory claimed that a car could consume up to half a gallon per hour while idling.

They also claimed that automatically turning off the engine when the vehicle stops and turning it back on when it moves again could save between 4% and 10% of fuel in the city… far from reality.

Included in every car

Although it started as a premium feature, today 65% of cars sold in the USA have this system, compared to just 1% in 2012. In Europe and Japan, the number goes beyond 90%! And although it’s not legally required, manufacturers receive fuel economy credits for including it, and where there’s money, well, we know how that goes.

The EPA hits the brakes

Now, after years of research, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the system barely reduces emissions and causes premature wear on the starter motor (which makes sense, it starts more often, even several times within an hour).

Although many tons of CO₂ savings have been estimated annually, the reality is that this system had many shortcomings, starting with the fact that it’s uncomfortable and annoying. And honestly… the fuel savings weren’t that great, estimated between 4% and 5%.

Was it really that annoying?

It was said that this system worked better in dense urban commutes, obviously, there are more stops than on a regular highway, where the system is irrelevant. Still, it’s annoying. Many drivers deactivate it due to discomfort or fear of it failing. The early versions were clunky and slow, and although they’ve improved, people still don’t like them.

The future of stop-start: end of the road?

It’s clear that brands started adding this system because of the incentives (not because they liked it) but now, if the EPA removes the credits that reward its use, brands will likely choose to eliminate it from future models.

Especially now that we’re moving closer to an electric future, something that would make this system obsolete and unnecessary.

Failed bet?

At the time, they represented an attempt to reduce emissions, but now that electrification and hydrogen are just around the corner, we can say that these stop-start systems did their job and can now be put to rest (finally).

What did the experts say?

According to Consumer Reports, for example, it depended on the specific vehicle. They pointed out the pros and cons of the system but admitted that in many cases the system was inconsistent and, as we’ve said, very annoying.

We’ll have to wait and see if this is a final goodbye (at least in our country, because Europe and China will probably continue using it) and whether we’ll miss it or feel relieved.

And you, what do you think of the stop-start system? Did you find it annoying too?",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/epa-trump-stop-start-system.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:14:22.433497

Meanwhile, E&E News reported that DOE is evaluating clean energy loan values for potential sale, signaling the office could shutter altogether.
Rolling back these standards could flood the market with outdated, energy-wasting products, driving up energy costs for millions.
As with his tariff threats, the uncertainty over whether permits will be honored undermines the confidence needed to finance clean energy projects.
Blocking these grants hampers clean energy development, particularly in communities that need lower energy costs the most.","Action: Invoking emergency powers under the 1935 Federal Power Act, former fossil fuel executive and current Secretary of Energy Chris Wright ordered a Michigan coal plant slated to close at the end of May to remain open, citing the potential for an energy emergency that doesn’t exist.

Impact: The move builds on a prior Trump executive order allowing DOE to cite grid reliability as a reason to force coal plants to remain open. Fossil Fuel enthusiast Chris Wright leaned on that rationale, warning of a potential summer energy emergency. But Michigan Public Service Commission chair Dan Scripps told The Detroit News that the state already produces more power than it needs, calling the DOE’s order “unnecessary” and warning it will raise costs for homes and businesses across the Midwest. MISO, the grid operator for Michigan and 14 other Midwest states, also confirmed last month it has “sufficient capacity” heading into summer. If Trump’s manufactured emergency were real, his own efforts to stall clean energy would only make it worse. Whether it’s using executive powers to block clean energy or abusing emergency authority to prop up the dying coal industry, the result is the same: Trump is forcing Americans to subsidize his fossil fuel cronies’ profits.

Action: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had taken a key step to reverse Biden-era fuel economy rules designed to save Americans money and reduce pollution.

Impact: In his first official move as Transportation Secretary, Duffy signed a memo acknowledging Trump’s policy of promoting fossil fuel use and initiating the rollback. He falsely claimed that the standards, along with a nonexistent federal “EV mandate,” are making cars unaffordable. In reality (something the former Real World star should be familiar with), the standards don’t even take effect until 2027, making his claim laughable on its face. The fuel economy rules now on the chopping block are projected to save drivers more than $23 billion in fuel costs, or roughly $600 per vehicle over its lifetime. Rolling them back, a top priority of fossil fuel companies, means less efficient cars and higher prices at the pump for American drivers.

Action: Trump’s EPA continued its push to illegally terminate $20 billion in clean energy grants, stalling projects funded through the GGRF’s National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator in low-income communities. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has claimed, without evidence, that the terminations were justified by misconduct and fraud. But The New York Times reported that a federal investigation may have ended after turning up no evidence of wrongdoing.

Impact: The terminations froze critical funding and halted projects aimed at lowering costs in communities that need it most. In Michigan, plans to build and renovate energy-efficient rental housing to address a severe housing shortage are now at risk, as developers can’t access the capital they were promised. This leaves more Michiganders unable to afford to live where they work. Millions more in funding for cost-saving measures, like insulating older homes, are also now on the chopping block.

Action: Trump’s DOE launched a sweeping “review” of 179 Biden-era awards, totaling more than $15 billion, signaling potential terminations. Days later, Semafor reported that the first cuts could target loans issued by the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO). And on May 29, the department officially canceled its first LPO loan.

Impact: The review casts serious doubt over key clean energy projects. Under Biden, the LPO approved more than 50 deals worth over $100 billion, including a major loan to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) expected to deliver $100 million in annual savings to 5.5 million Californians. But with rising costs from Trump’s tariffs and mounting uncertainty over the promised loan, PG&E says it can no longer factor in those savings, meaning customers will foot the bill. Other utilities, including those in Michigan, face similar risks. Meanwhile, E&E News reported that DOE is evaluating clean energy loan values for potential sale, signaling the office could shutter altogether.

Action: Trump’s DOE proposed repealing or weakening more than two dozen efficiency standards, including for appliances, claiming the move would save Americans more than $11 billion.

Impact: The DOE’s own analysis shows the move would increase utility bills by more than $54 billion, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. Rolling back these standards could flood the market with outdated, energy-wasting products, driving up energy costs for millions.

Action: The New York Times reported that Trump’s EPA plans to terminate the ENERGY STAR program, a widely used labeling system that helps consumers identify energy-efficient appliances.

Impact: Though ENERGY STAR is authorized under the Clean Air Act and cannot be unilaterally scrapped, the move aligns with Trump’s efforts to dismantle environmental programs in favor of fossil fuel interests. The program costs just $32 million annually but saves consumers over $40 billion each year on utility bills. In March, dozens of companies urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to protect ENERGY STAR. They warned that eliminating it “will not serve the American people,” especially as electricity demand is set to surge in the years ahead.

Action: According to a court filing reported by The Washington Post, the EPA plans to cancel all grants issued by its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, nearly 800 in total. The filing came just days after reports that the EPA would fire every staffer working on environmental justice.

Impact: Although the agency is required to conduct a detailed review of each grant before termination, experts say the EPA has yet to provide evidence that any such reviews have taken place and may have misled the court. If finalized, the cancellations would strip funding from vulnerable communities working to lower energy costs and protect residents from air and water pollution, halting critical progress towards healthier, more affordable communities.

Action: Citing Trump’s fake day one “energy emergency” declaration, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track approvals for fossil fuels on public lands, claiming the declaration allows it to radically slash environmental review timelines required by bedrock environmental laws.

Impact: Despite expert consensus that no such energy emergency exists, Trump is cutting project review timelines from a year to just 14 days, effectively eliminating public input opportunities. While nearly all new electricity supply last year came from renewables, Trump paused new solar and wind approvals on federal land and waters, just one of many actions he’s taken to deliberately slow clean energy deployment (while he later resumed review of solar projects, wind approvals remain paused and developers report that lack of agency staff is impacting project financing, purchasing, and construction start dates). Ironically, his fake energy emergency risks creating a real one. By sidelining clean energy and locking in costly fossil fuels, permitting laws and environmental reviews be damned, utilities will pass rising costs on to consumers. This is just as electricity demand is surging.

Action: The Trump administration ordered Equinor to halt construction of its fully permitted Empire Wind 1 farm, claiming, without evidence, that its underlying environmental analysis was rushed.

Impact: Although the Trump administration later allowed construction to resume, the abrupt halt sent a chilling message to investors: under Trump, even fully permitted projects aren’t safe. As with his tariff threats, the uncertainty over whether permits will be honored undermines the confidence needed to finance clean energy projects. This jacks up costs that will ultimately get passed on to American households.

Action: Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the DOE to prevent coal plants from shutting down, even if they violate environmental rules or drive up power costs.

Impact: Coal is the dirtiest and most expensive source of electricity on the grid. Trump’s order not only overrides state authority to regulate utilities, but it also forces consumers to foot the bill for aging, uneconomical plants. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has even floated restarting already shuttered coal plants. The result: Polluters rake in guaranteed profits while Americans get stuck with higher energy bills. All while cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable alternatives are available.

Action: The Trump administration abruptly fired the entire staff overseeing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the $4.1 billion program that helps low-income families afford their utility bills. Weeks later, the White House proposed cutting the program entirely.

Impact: LIHEAP helps families pay for heating oil, weatherize homes, and avoid utility shutoffs. With no staff to distribute remaining funds, despite a congressional mandate to do so, advocates warned millions could be left without aid. The Department of Health and Human Services briefly rehired one employee to release the final round of funding, but the next day, Trump’s budget proposed eliminating the program altogether, calling it “unnecessary.” More than 6 million households could now face reduced or eliminated benefits, leaving them unable to afford basic heating or cooling.

Action: Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country across the globe, including our allies, claiming they’ve maintained unfair trade relationships with the U.S.

Impact: Even as the White House has walked back some tariffs (for now), and the Courts are considering the legality of Trump’s authority to impose them, much of the damage was already done. Energy markets have been thrown into turmoil. U.S. liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) is now positioned as a bargaining chip, after Trump floated that Europe could avoid tariffs by buying more American gas. Trading partners may ramp up purchase commitments to rebalance trade. This could potentially trigger volatile swings in household energy bills. Meanwhile, the ongoing uncertainty around Trump’s tariff whims is worsening supply chain disruptions for key electrical components. This is slowing the buildout of renewable energy and critical grid infrastructure and driving costs higher for new and existing projects.

Action: On his first day back in office, Trump lifted the freeze on LNG export approvals. His DOE later removed a major regulatory hurdle, further unleashing fossil fuel companies’ ability to sell gas overseas.

Impact: Even before Trump’s election, North American gas exports, driven by new U.S. projects, were on track to more than double by 2028. According to E&E News, EIA expects LNG-driven demand to push prices higher this year and next. Easing the path for new export projects means more gas going overseas—and higher energy costs at home.

Action: As Trump’s EPA shuts down environmental justice programs, all of the grants under the CCGP, including a project that installs solar panels in low-income neighborhoods, are under review, and some are “already slated to be terminated.”

Impact: Terminating this program blocks cost-saving clean energy projects in disadvantaged communities overburdened by pollution and more significant climate risks, keeping energy bills high. Terminating this program risks the future of projects that are lowering utility costs, as well as providing clean drinking water and disaster shelters in disadvantaged communities. For example, New Haven, Connecticut, planned to use $20 million in community change grants to help low-income residents cut energy costs with energy-efficient home upgrades—but Trump’s freeze has left that funding in limbo.

Action: Trump’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), at the direction of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, eliminated GRRP, which funds energy efficiency upgrades in affordable housing.

Impact: Cutting this program raises energy costs for thousands of low-income renters, especially seniors and families in federal-assisted housing. The GRRP funds urgent repairs to keep tens of thousands of affordable housing units livable, including energy efficiency improvements like replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems and aging insulation or windows. Projects using the funds are required to keep units affordable for up to 25 years. They also leverage funds to secure other investments for significant repairs and renovations “Projects will fail,” said one affordable housing developer, “And these are projects that are already difficult to finance.”

Action: Trump imposed a national tariff tax on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico, including on Canadian energy imports, triggering price spikes. While he’s temporarily delayed some tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, a 10% national tariff tax on energy imported from Canada remains in place.

Impact: Trump’s national tariff tax will ultimately raise prices for all American consumers, with midwestern states hit the hardest. Because energy infrastructure like pipelines and refineries are slow to adapt, imports of foreign fuels are likely to continue with higher costs passed on to consumers. That means higher gas prices and fewer, more expensive clean energy projects. In states like Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, gas prices are expected to jump up to 50 cents per gallon. And, heating bills will climb as tariffs on methane gas from Canada, America’s largest supplier, get passed down to households.

Action: Trump’s EPA blocked $20 billion in grants from the GGRF’s National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator programs, which fund clean energy projects in low-income communities. On March 11, the EPA attempted to formally (if not legally) revoke grants from those programs.

Impact: The purpose of GGRF programs is to lower energy costs for everyday Americans. Blocking these grants hampers clean energy development, particularly in communities that need lower energy costs the most. For example, the Climate United NEXT grant program helps communities historically left behind deploy clean energy projects that reduce pollution and cut energy bills. The Power Forward Communities grant program finances energy efficiency upgrades that help lower housing costs and utility bills while expanding and preserving affordable housing. While a federal court has blocked Trump’s EPA from illegally clawing back these grants for now, Trump’s efforts to terminate the program have left that funding in limbo and delayed projects that would deliver cost savings for the communities that need it most. It’s part of a broader “starve the beast” strategy: by dragging out uncertainty, they’re trying to force organizations to run out of funding and collapse.

Action: Trump’s day one executive order also froze funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, cutting support for building Electric Vehicle charging stations. After multiple federal judges blocked the administration’s efforts to gut the program, Trump’s Department of Transportation once again attempted to sabotage the NEVI program with an illegal power grab thinly disguised as a bureaucratic update.

Impact: Without this federal investment, rural communities in states like Ohio and Texas will struggle to build charging infrastructure, making it harder for residents to switch to cost-saving EVs. Fewer EVs on the road means higher demand for gasoline, driving up prices at the pump for everyone—hittingdrivers in rural communities and working families hardest. The uncertainty around federal investment also threatens the auto industry in states like Michigan, where billions have been invested to attract EV manufacturing. Industry leaders point to a lack of publicly accessible chargers as one major barrier to domestic demand. Trump’s NEVI sabotage undermines efforts like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal to install 100,000 chargers by 2030, slowing EV adoption, threatening the state’s clean energy economy and thousands of high-quality jobs in the state.

Action: Trump froze federal leasing for new offshore wind projects and onshore projects on federal lands and blocked permits for in-progress projects.

Impact: Delaying these projects reduces future grid capacity and raises electricity prices by ensuring that supply can’t keep up with growing energy demand. Coastal states are counting on gigawatts of energy from offshore wind and are now scrambling to fill the gap to avoid brownouts. Thousands of jobs have been lost or are at risk because of these project cancellations and delays. And, increased uncertainty in the wind energy market is driving higher costs for new and existing projects.

Urge Your Senators to Protect Clean Energy Programs in the Federal Budget

House Republicans have passed their disastrous budget bill that cuts lifesaving programs like SNAP and Medicaid and takes billions of dollars in climate funding away from households, workers, disadvantaged communities, businesses, and more—so they can give that money directly to the ultra-wealthy and corporations. As Republicans attempt to fast-track it through the Senate, urge Democrats in the Senate to hold strong and not give an inch.

""Trump calls this a big beautiful bill, it's big all right, but big in bad ways,"" Sen. Schumer said. ""Yep, big energy price increases for small businesses and families, big job losses throughout America, big win for China.""

The bill in senate right now, in part would cut federal energy investments. New York Companies use that investment to lower energy costs, create more jobs, and bring manufacturing back in the United States.

Schumer specifically highlighted how the bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families in New York up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have ensured a robust buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

Eliminates the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit that supports American-made clean hydrogen, led by New York companies like Plug Power and Air Products, to be used for clean manufacturing and agriculture.",https://cnycentral.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/8a83d325-fd8b-4e87-abec-f11079ff233f-CHUCKSCHUMERGETTY.png,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:30.773410

A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies.
On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.","A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available. Chevron didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, Ted Boutrous, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F22%2F51ec358e477dad10b50725079666%2Fgettyimages-2185677781.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 12:23:52.824657

“To Ford Motor Company, it is not acceptable to rely on buying batteries from China forever,” Bill Ford said in a statement.
That is why we’re building a new battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, so battery assembly can be done by American workers right here.
Additionally, the bill is aiming to rescind existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond.
Of further concern to Ford is the fact that this bill is aiming to rescind unobligated funding that supports the manufacture of certain advanced technology vehicles.","Back in January – amid reports that President Donald Trump was eyeing the possibility of killing off the federal EV tax credit – Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that such a move would have a “a significant impact” on the industry, and not just in terms of making the act of purchasing EVs more expensive for consumers that qualify. Rather, the under-construction BlueOval Battery Park Michigan site, which is slated to build lithium iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries for future EVs, is dependent on those funds as well. Now that it seems more likely that the EV tax credit is in fact going away, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford is speaking out on the matter, too.

“To Ford Motor Company, it is not acceptable to rely on buying batteries from China forever,” Bill Ford said in a statement. “We’re America’s top auto producer and we’ve always built in America. That is why we’re building a new battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, so battery assembly can be done by American workers right here. The House bill puts this at risk. Congress can make a decision to either force the U.S. to remain dependent on China or enter a new era of American independence and innovation.”

As Ford Authority reported earlier this month, a group of House Republicans introduced a bill that proposes killing off the federal EV tax credit, as well as repealing fuel efficiency rules. If the bill passes, it would end the $7,500 new EV tax credit and $4,000 used credit at the conclusion of 2025, though automakers that haven’t sold 200,000 electric vehicles would continue to qualify for the credit for an additional year. Additionally, the bill is aiming to rescind existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond.

One thing that the bill isn’t aiming to get rid of are battery production tax credits for automakers and battery makers, though it would add a provision that bars credits for vehicles that utilize components made by Chinese companies or using licensed technology from that country starting in 2027 – a major sticking point for Ford, which plans to utilize licensed LFP battery tech from China-based CATL at the under-construction BlueOval Battery Park Michigan site. Of further concern to Ford is the fact that this bill is aiming to rescind unobligated funding that supports the manufacture of certain advanced technology vehicles.",https://fordauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ford-BlueOval-Battery-Park-Michigan-June-2024-Progress-001.jpeg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:13.590479

The rule – proposed by the Biden administration last July – would require companies to offer outdoor workers paid water and rest breaks above certain temperatures, the article explains.
By awarding both projects the status of “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, the planning process is elevated from a local level to a decision by the secretary of state, the article explains.
It notes that without new reservoirs, the government says national water supplies would “remain under threat” from population increases and the impacts of climate change.
The newspaper says this “could mean the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of investment in road, rail and green energy projects”.","More than $14bn in low-carbon US energy investments have either been cancelled or delayed this year according to analysis by clean-energy business group E2, reports the Associated Press. It says the group also estimates that losses since January have cost 10,000 new clean-energy jobs. The article continues that companies are “concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits”. These tax credits were boosted by former president Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), but many of its incentives would be “render[ed] moot” by the new bill if it passes in its current form, the outlet explains. E2 estimates that – excluding the cancellations – there have been $132bn in clean-energy plans announced since the IRA passed, the article adds. Nevertheless, Inside Climate News says the scale of cancellations since Donald Trump took office reflects businesses’ “uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid president Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat”. It says this trend marks an “ominous sign” as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s bill. Among the cancelled projects are a $3.3bn Stellantis battery plant in Illinois and RWE’s halting of offshore wind development in the US, according to E&E News. It says that, of the $14bn in halted projects, $4.5bn took place in April alone.

In related news, Ford executive chair Bill Ford has warned that the disappearance of tax credits for electric-car manufacturing would threaten the company’s projected $3bn investment in a Michigan plant that is already 60% complete and expected to employ 1,700 people, Reuters reports. Another Reuters story reports that solar panel maker Meyer Burger has closed a US factory in Arizona “due to financial troubles”. This article, too, mentions the wider context of the US government threatening incentives for clean-energy industries. Semafor says that as negotiations continue around the bill that could bring in tax credit cuts, the process could threaten “an even more important clean energy goal” – namely, permitting reform. Elon Musk’s company Tesla has issued a statement criticising the “Republican megabill” for cutting clean-energy tax credits, Politico says. It adds that this message was later “amplified” by Musk on his personal X account.

A group of 22 young people in the US have sued the Trump administration over executive orders that they say are “unconstitutional and would cripple the clean energy industry, suppress climate science and worsen global warming”, the New York Times reports. The plaintiffs are from Montana, Hawaii, Oregon and other states – and are represented by the NGO Our Children’s Trust, the article says. It explains: “The plaintiffs argue that they are already experiencing harms from a warming planet in the form of wildfires, drought and hurricanes, and that Trump’s executive orders will make conditions even worse.” The Guardian says the case is based on the idea that Trump’s executive orders “are violating [the plaintiffs’] constitutional rights to life and liberty”. The case also argues that the “federal government is engaging in unlawful executive overreach by breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health”, the article adds.

Meanwhile, Politico reports that the Supreme Court has ruled that federal agencies carrying out environmental reviews can take a more limited view of the impacts of transport and energy infrastructure projects, which does not take into account all “the climate effects of fossil fuels that move through them and will later be burned”. The article says: “The ruling follows years of complaints from industry and Republicans – and some Democrats – that National Environmental Policy Act reviews had ballooned in scope and become a legal hurdle in some cases.”

Finally, E&E News says the oil-and-gas industry is “pushing the Trump administration to kill a proposed rule that would protect workers from extreme heat”. The rule – proposed by the Biden administration last July – would require companies to offer outdoor workers paid water and rest breaks above certain temperatures, the article explains. Scientific American notes that the oil industry is “among the nation’s leading workplaces for heat-related deaths and injuries”.

A drought has been declared in north-west England, following the driest period on record across the country between February and April, the Guardian reports. Despite recent rain, the newspaper explains that the nation’s rivers are at “exceptionally low flows” and reservoir levels are declining. It notes: “Climate breakdown will make droughts more likely, scientists have said, as rainfall becomes less predictable.” The Independent reports that the UK has experienced its sunniest spring since records began. It adds that the current dry spell follows a period of extreme wet weather, with England experiencing its wettest 12 months on record up to September 2024. The Environment Agency has warned that there is a “medium” risk of drought across the whole of England this summer if there is not sustained rainfall, Sky News says.

This follows news that the government is “fast-tracking” plans for the first new UK reservoirs in three decades in Lincolnshire and East Anglia, BusinessGreen reports. By awarding both projects the status of “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, the planning process is elevated from a local level to a decision by the secretary of state, the article explains. It notes that without new reservoirs, the government says national water supplies would “remain under threat” from population increases and the impacts of climate change. Water minister Emma Hardy tells BBC News: “This is really important because if we don’t build the reservoirs, we’re going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.” The new projects are scheduled for completion in 2036 and 2040, the article says. The Times quotes an interview Hardy gave to Times Radio, in which she said that without new reservoirs people in the UK could face water restrictions similar to those seen in the Mediterranean. The article says that government plans for new homes and data centres place additional strain on water supplies. An opinion piece by Daily Telegraph columnist Henry Hill lambasts successive UK governments for not doing more to tackle drought. He does not mention climate change.

In more UK news, the Guardian reports that government advisors the Climate Change Committee (CCC) have stated that flexibilities announced by the government for the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate could lead to higher emissions. The changes could lead to more plug-in hybrids being sold at the expense of electric vehicles, which would limit emissions savings, the newspaper explains. In a story trailed on its frontpage, the i newspaper reports that Tesla has been pushing the UK government to “overhaul” a £2bn scheme that supports biofuels used in vehicles – the renewable transport fuel obligation – to “allow the electric car company access to the lucrative carbon credit market”.

Finally, the Times reports, in a frontpage story, that UK chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to announce a multibillion-pound investment package in the north and Midlands “to combat the threat of Reform” in the upcoming 11 June spending review. The newspaper says this “could mean the announcement of tens of billions of pounds of investment in road, rail and green energy projects”.

Wildfires in western Canada have now been declared emergencies in two provinces where thousands of people have fled their homes, BBC News reports. Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe has announced a state of emergency as 14 wildfires “rage uncontrollably” in the province, it explains. A state of emergency has also been declared in the province of Manitoba as multiple wildfires spread across nearly 200,000 hectares, the Globe and Mail reports. The area burned across the province this year is already triple the five-year annual average for Manitoba, the article adds. CBC News reports that thousands of First Nations people in northern Manitoba are among those that have been forced to evacuate. There are currently 134 active fires across Canada, half of which are “considered out of control”, including the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, according to Le Monde. The article quotes Manitoba premier Wab Kinew saying: “For the first time, it’s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.” In its coverage of the Canadian fires, CNN explains that “climate change is leading to an increase in wildfire risk days, as well as more frequent and larger fires that exhibit more extreme wildfire behaviour”.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that a “short-lived but punishing blast of intense heat” will hit the western US out to Saturday, with “temperatures rising to near-record values”. It adds: “The unusual intensity of high pressure is a marker of human-caused climate change.”

Finally, new analysis by scientists at World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre finds that half of the world’s population “endured an additional month of extreme heat over the past year because of man-made climate change”, according to Agence France-Presse.

France will push for China and the EU to take on “global climate leadership” during meetings of ecological transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher with Chinese officials and former climate envoy Xie Zhenhua in Beijing, Agence France-Presse reports. The newswire quotes an anonymous source saying the meetings aim to “see how, given the US withdrawal [from climate leadership], we can try to build a new convergence between the EU and China on climate”. Euractiv cites a member of Pannier-Runacher’s team saying it is “extremely important” for China and the EU to “send out a very strong message”, given “doubts” around “climate multilateralism and the COP system”. An article under the byline GT Voice in the state-supporting newspaper Global Times says “China-EU cooperation” in the electric vehicle supply chain will “bring greater certainty to the achievement of global carbon neutrality goals”.

Foreign minister Wang Yi pledged “increased support” to Pacific Island countries “in addressing climate change” at a recent summit, according to Reuters, including “100 ‘small but beautiful’ projects” and a $2m investment in “clean energy…[and] low-carbon infrastructure”. Wang said “China’s commitment” to global climate governance will “not waver” despite the “withdrawal of certain major countries from the Paris agreement”, Xinhua reports. The Communist party-affiliated People’s Daily publishes an article under the byline Zhong Sheng, a pen name indicating the article expresses party leadership’s views on global affairs, urging US-China science and technology cooperation to tackle “pressing” challenges such as climate change. China and African countries have built solar power stations with an installed capacity exceeding 1.5 gigawatts that could “power millions of African households”, another People’s Daily article says. A Global Times editorial notes that a summit held by China, ASEAN and the Gulf states, in which they agreed to “deepen cooperation…in energy security”, is an “event of major significance”.

Former finance vice-minister of finance Zhu Guangyao said that China’s emissions will likely “peak a few years ahead” of 2030, citing analysis in Carbon Brief, Bloomberg reports. Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng “called for greater efforts” to combat desertification, says state news agency Xinhua. Opinions issued by the State Council and Central Committee urged China to establish “sound trading systems for carbon emission rights” by 2027, stating China will shift from controlling carbon intensity to controlling total carbon emissions and increase allocation-based trading, BJX News says. China “ranked first in the world for nine years” in pumped-storage hydropower capacity, China Economic Daily reports. A major “clean-energy transmission line” in Inner Mongolia has been completed, state-run newspaper China Daily reports. Despite “relatively high production costs” and other challenges, hydrogen energy has “huge potential”, Ma Ding and Gao Zirui, professor postdoctoral fellow respectively at Peking University, write in the People’s Daily.

More than three-quarters of the world’s glaciers are on track to vanish “if climate change continues unchecked”, according to a new study covered by Agence France-Presse. Under existing climate policies, which would see temperatures rise 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, 76% of glacier mass would be gone, an outcome that would fuel sea-level rise and threaten water supplies for billions of people, the article says. However, it adds that if the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C target were reached, the study concludes that 54% of glacial mass could be preserved. Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and ETH Zurich who led the study, tells AFP that, given this potential to save glaciers, the findings should be seen as a “message of hope”. Other outlets take a different tack, with the New York Times headline reading: “Some glaciers will vanish no matter what, study finds.” The newspaper explains that “even if global temperatures stayed where they are today for the next thousand years, essentially an impossibility, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass”. It explains that glaciers are melting much faster than polar ice sheets in response to climate change, partly because they are smaller. The Guardian says that “almost 40% of glaciers in existence today are already doomed to melt due to climate-heating emissions from fossil fuels”. It says 75% of glaciers in the western US and Canada are “already doomed” to melt, while those in the higher, colder ranges of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges would be more resilient.

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that “the landslide that buried most of a Swiss village this week is focusing renewed attention on the role of global warming in glacier collapses around the world and the increasing dangers”. Finally, Atmos reports on “the mountain deity being lost to climate change”. It says tropical glaciers high in Uganda’s Rwenzori Mountains are rapidly melting, adding that for the Bakonzo people, “the loss is not only environmental – it’s displacing the mountain god who lives inside the ice”.

Elinor Bale from the Conservative Environment Network has an article in BusinessGreen arguing that the UK needs to focus more on developing nuclear power. She points to the government’s target of achieving clean electricity by 2030 and says “their ambition in tackling climate change so quickly is admirable, but the government’s approach risks setting itself up for failure”. Bale argues that, due to the focus on 2030, longer term planning has been deprioritised, writing: “Decisions on new energy projects that might not be ready until the next decade, such as nuclear, are being sent to the back of the queue despite their importance to decarbonising without increasing energy bills.” Bale points to the small modular nuclear reactor competition that is currently underway, but which she says has been “significantly delayed”. She acknowledges that the fault does not lie entirely with the relatively new Labour government, noting that there have been “endless delays on crucial nuclear decisions”. The article suggests measures to “streamline red tape” and boost nuclear power, including accepting reactor designs from “other trusted regulators” outside the UK, such as South Korea and France. Bale concludes: “Britain has a proud history when it comes to nuclear. We are in desperate need of consistent, green energy that provides our nation with security and economic growth. Nuclear ticks all these boxes.”

A Times editorial includes a swipe at the hard-right Reform UK party and its leader, Nigel Farage, specifically referencing the “fantasy economics” he has proposed in recent days. The newspaper says: “It must be great fun in Rothmans-puffing, covert-coated ­circles to josh about scrapping quangos, sacking diversity officers and junking everything to do with net-zero, whatever that means in practice…But it won’t pay the bill (we are talking more than the entire ­defence budget here) for raising the income tax threshold by £7,430 to £20,000.”",,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:35.747123

Speaking at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Mackinac Island, Ford said the company’s $3.5 billion investment and its plan to employ 1,700 workers hinge on production tax credits passed under former President Joe Biden’s climate law. Those incentives are now under threat as House Republicans move to roll them back through new legislation.

However, if the credits do not remain, they will have “imperil” impacts on the automakers’ Marshall battery facility. “We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” executive chairman Ford said.

The bill passed by the U.S. House earlier this month would eliminate tax credits for batteries made with Chinese technology after 2031. Ford’s factory, now under construction, plans to use technology from Chinese battery manufacturer CATL. The legislation still faces a vote in the Senate, where opposition remains strong among Democrats and some fiscally conservative Republicans.

Ford reiterated after the event that “nothing needs to change” about the tax credit, emphasizing that the Marshall project’s business case was built around it.

Initially announced in 2023, the Marshall plant was expected to produce enough battery capacity to support 400,000 EVs annually. Ford later revised that number to 230,000 vehicles due to softening demand. The company also accepted a reduced incentive package from the state of Michigan after lowering its output goals.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment — that, to me, is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ford-executive-chairman--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:19.616428

The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law.
The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has proposed eliminating duplicative exams, honoring trade licenses, giving entrepreneurs more flexibility and streamlining reporting requirements.

1 thing I’m hearing here at the (Mackinac Policy) conference is, ‘Are we going to get a budget done on time?","MACKINAC ISLAND — House Republicans will propose ways to overhaul Michigan’s “out-of-control” regulatory environment and look to create a new, more powerful legislative committee that could block or change rules written by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, Speaker Matt Hall said Wednesday.

During a news conference at the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Mackinac Policy Conference, the Republican spoke about state permitting reform, a topic the Democratic governor raised in her State of the State address. It is also top of mind following a recent fight between homebuilders and her administration over construction regulations that critics estimate will add around $15,000 to the price of a new home.

“We’re going to start reasserting the power of the Legislature on these regulations,” Hall said. “That will play out. We’ll introduce it. Hopefully the (Democratic-led) Senate will embrace it. But we really need a much stronger regulatory committee that can engage earlier in this process and actually continue to block these rules from taking effect or change them.”

The bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, which includes five Republicans and five Democrats, can give input on proposed regulations, but lawmakers often are ultimately powerless to stop them if an administration wants to put them in place.

A House-passed replacement for JCAR could run into opposition from the Senate and Whitmer. A message seeking comment was left with the governor’s spokespeople.

“Our regulatory situation is out of control,” Hall said. “A lot of the problems when you’re here at this conference and you’re talking to these business leaders, they stem from the fact that we’re over-regulated.”

The House point person on the initiative, Rep. Bill G. Schuette, R-Midland, alleged that it can sometimes take a business three times longer to get a permit in Michigan than in Ohio and Indiana. He noted lack of housing and child care as areas of particular concern and said projects are being unnecessarily delayed. He plans to release a report on the issue as soon as next week.

“It’ll be comprehensive. I think it’ll be really impactful for ways that we can really cut down on some red tape,” Schuette said.

In February, Whitmer said she would instruct state departments and agencies that had missed deadlines to refund any business permitting fees they can under the law. She also called for unspecified changes in law to speed “broken” permitting.

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has proposed eliminating duplicative exams, honoring trade licenses, giving entrepreneurs more flexibility and streamlining reporting requirements. Whitmer has said she would enact some of those changes on her own, but others would require new laws.

Hall said he agrees with “a lot” in the Whitmer administration’s report but wants to go further.

Also Wednesday, Republicans said they will propose increasing base K-12 funding, now $9,608 per student, to $12,000 by eliminating what are known as categorical funds that districts get for specific purposes. The idea is to “simplify” the budget and “get back to basics” by trusting school leaders to make decisions instead of lawmakers, said Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township.

Republicans will also propose a new college scholarship program for every high school graduate who attends a Michigan university or college. It would be $5,500 annually to attend a four-year school, $2,750 to go to community college. The state already offers a scholarship worth a similar amount, but students must demonstrate a financial need to qualify.

Hall said Republicans will present their budget “very soon.” The state Legislature is required to send the governor the next budget by July 1, but Hall has signaled it may not be finalized until later because Republicans are looking for cuts to boost road funding and cover a proposed income tax decrease. The start of the fiscal year is Oct. 1.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, whose caucus approved a plan two weeks ago, said it is “troubling” that the House has not passed its full budget proposal.

“The No. 1 thing I’m hearing here at the (Mackinac Policy) conference is, ‘Are we going to get a budget done on time?'” she said. “Not if the House doesn’t show up to negotiate.”

Powering Up

NuScale Power submitted its standard design application to the NRC on New Year’s Day back in 2023 seeking a power uprate to 77 MWe for each power module, with a total plant power output of 462 MWe.

The design builds on the company’s 50-MWe design, which was certified the same year, becoming just the seventh reactor design cleared for use in the United States by the NRC.

NuScale’s power plant can house to up to six factory-built power modules that together are about a third of the size of a large-scale reactor.

The advanced light-water systems leverage natural processes, such as convection and gravity, to passively cool the reactor without additional water, power, or even operator action.

The uprated power modules include the same safety features as NuScale’s 50 MWe design with some select design changes to meet the nation’s growing power demands while also improving the overall economics of building and operating the plant.

“NuScale is proud to have worked with the NRC and to have met its stringent regulatory application process as we continue to lead the way in the SMR industry with our second design approval,” said Carrie Fosaaen, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Services in a NuScale press release.

What’s Next

NuScale’s uprated power module design can now be referenced by companies when applying for combined licenses or construction permits to build the reactors on a specific site.

NuScale is currently performing front-end engineering work for RoPower’s 462-MWe power plant in Romania and has 12 power modules in production with its manufacturing partner Doosan as it works to build up an orderbook.

The U.S. Department of Energy has provided more than $575 million in support of the design and licensing of NuScale’s SMR plant.

Small modular reactors are expected to play a key role in the nation’s nuclear resurgence as the Trump Administration works to unleash more affordable, reliable and secure American energy for U.S. taxpayers.

(NASDAQ: EOSE) (“Eos” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of its offering of $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.75% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on June 3, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Eos also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes.

The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Eos and will accrue interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2025. The notes will mature on June 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before March 15, 2030, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after March 15, 2030, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Eos will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Eos’s election. The initial conversion rate is 196.0784 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.10 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 27.5% over the public offering price in the concurrent common stock offering described below. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Eos’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 20, 2028 and on or before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Eos’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Eos to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to (x) 110% (or, if the effective date of such fundamental change is on or after June 15, 2027, 105%) of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus (y) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.

Eos estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of notes will be $216,000,000 (or $240,000,000 if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions. Eos intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock referred to below, if it is consummated, (i) to repurchase the full $126 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 5%/6% Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Note due 2026 in a privately negotiated transaction for approximately $131 million; (ii) to prepay $50 million of outstanding borrowings due under its credit agreement, dated June 21, 2024, by and between Eos and CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP (the “Credit Agreement”); and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Upon the prepayment of $50 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the PIK interest rate under the Credit Agreement will decrease from 15% to 7% and the financial covenants thereunder will be waived until 2027.

After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.

Of the 24 awards cancelled, nearly 70% (16 of the 24 projects) were signed between Election Day and January 20th. The projects primarily include funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. By terminating these awards, DOE is generating an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said Secretary Wright. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

Earlier this month, DOE issued a Secretarial Memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” which outlined DOE’s policy for evaluating financial assistance on a case-by-case basis to identity waste of taxpayer dollars, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s commitment to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people. DOE utilized this review process to evaluate each of these 24 awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to sustain DOE’s investment.

Broadcast version by Terri Dee for Illinois News Connection reporting for the Canary Media-Resource Rural-Public News Service Collaboration

A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable's life.

It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the ""Decatur Seven"" drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.

Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support ""from around the world,"" but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He's already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

""By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,"" Honorable said. ""I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I'll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what's going on with this clean energy thing.""

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.

Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois' 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Decatur's hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That's thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.

""The pieces are all coming together,"" Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. ""What makes this region unique is that it's not just about one company or one product line. It's about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won't just be on the coasts - it's being built right here in the Midwest.""

The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.

""So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,"" said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.

Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers - from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.

""We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there's a lot of excitement in the city,"" Carson said. ""That's magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.""

Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce

Richland Community College's clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

""Being called the N-word, couldn't that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,"" said Carson. ""We really dive deep into what's motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.""

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students - for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.

Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.

Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.

He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn't easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.

Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.

""After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,"" James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.

James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.

""As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,"" said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.

""I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,"" James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.

How Illinois' energy policy prioritizes equity

Illinois' 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state's clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.

FEJA's rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn't help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and remedied snafus in the original law.

Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that oversaw FEJA job training and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.

""They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,"" Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups ""are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they're overburdened because of the large lift.""

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as ""navigators,"" using the trust and credibility they've developed in communities to recruit trainees.

Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub's navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.

""The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,"" said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. ""The navigator is saying, 'Hey, I've connected with this portion of the population that's been overlooked or underserved.' OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I'll get them interviewed. We're seeing a real pipeline into careers.""

The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students - for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.

""If you need some help, they always there for you,"" James said.

What's next for Decatur and its clean energy trainees?

In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are much more elaborate and sensitive than those for internal combustion engines.

In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the groundbreaking of an Electric Vehicle Innovation Hub, which will include a climatic research facility - basically a high-tech wind tunnel where companies and researchers from across the world can send EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.

A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive from the state are funding the wind tunnel and the new facilities where Richland classes will be held. In 2022, Pritzker announced these investments as furthering the state goal of 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.

Far from the gritty industrial environs that likely characterized Decatur workplaces of the past, the classrooms at TCCI feature colorful decor, comfortable armchairs, and bright, airy spaces adjacent to pristine high-tech manufacturing floors lined with machines.

""This hub is a game changer,"" said Keiser, noting the need for trained tradespeople. ""As a country, we place a lot of emphasis on kids going to college, and maybe we've kind of overlooked getting tangible skills in the hands of folks.""

A marketing firm founded by Kara Demirjian - Richard Demirjian's sister - and located on-site with TCCI also received clean energy hub funds to promote the training program. This has been crucial to the hub's success, according to Ariana Bennick, account executive at the firm, DCC Marketing. Its team has developed, tested, and deployed digital billboards, mailers, ads, Facebook events, and other approaches to attract trainees and business partners.

""Being a part of something here in Decatur that's really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,"" Bennick said. ""It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.""

With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he'll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he's learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.

""A little at a time - I'm going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I'm passionate about, and then see what's next,"" Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series ""The Flintstones,"" in which the characters' leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: ""Like Fred and Barney, I'll be up and running.""

The plant is a crucial piece of Ford’s strategy to ramp up electric vehicle production, but it’s all dependent on those tax credits staying in place.

At the recent Mackinac Policy Conference in Michigan, Ford executive chair Bill Ford voiced his concerns, noting that “it’s not fair to change policy after all the expenditures have been made.” He added that because “the production tax credits seems to be up for grabs,” the site could be “imperiled,” as reported by TTNews.

Read: Ford’s EV Sales Just Fell Off A Cliff And Discounts Didn’t Make A Dent

Recently passed by the House, the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ aims to eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits introduced under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Many of these credits were designed to build a domestic EV supply chain and encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, billions of dollars in private investments were funneled into EV manufacturing in the U.S. The Electrification Coalition reports major investments in states like North Carolina ($25.4 billion), Georgia ($24.5 billion), and Tennessee ($12.4 billion), all designed to jumpstart the transition to electric mobility.

The New Bill’s Impact on EV and Battery Manufacturing

If the new bill passes, it will not only phase out the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, but it will also cut off the manufacturer credit for battery producers after 2031. The bill also comes with stricter rules that limit the use of Chinese components and materials in U.S. manufacturing.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”

Ford’s Michigan battery plant is also tied to a licensing agreement with CATL, a Chinese battery maker. While Ford holds full control over the manufacturing process, production, and workforce, it’s tapping into CATL’s expertise to help with factory equipment installation and to provide critical battery technology know-how.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2024-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Bronze_09-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:23.186676

The analysts emphasized the need for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and investors to prioritize flexibility, as the initial phase of easy EV growth—characterized by policy support, premium pricing, and supply constraints—is coming to an end. The next phase is expected to be more capital-intensive and politically volatile, requiring OEMs to have flexible architectures, cost discipline, and regulatory agility to navigate the expanding mainstream market successfully.

This strategic positioning is anticipated to help Stellantis maintain better returns on EV investments compared to its Detroit counterparts.

In contrast, Ford has taken cautious steps by delaying and canceling some of its EV projects while it develops a new EV platform expected to launch in 2027 or later. Bernstein notes that Ford’s transparent reporting structure reveals the company’s Model e EV business unit will continue to incur billions in losses, with significant volume growth needed to achieve profitability in the coming years. According to InvestingPro analysis, Ford currently trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 8.09 and offers a substantial 7.34% dividend yield, though its gross profit margins remain challenged at 8.07%. For deeper insights into Ford’s valuation and 12+ additional ProTips, including detailed financial health scores and Fair Value estimates, investors can access the comprehensive Pro Research Report available on InvestingPro.

General Motors (NYSE: ), meanwhile, has reduced its planned investments in battery manufacturing, reflecting a more conservative approach. While this results in slower EV volume growth and delayed profitability, General Motors is perceived to be avoiding impulsive decisions and focusing on a long-term strategy with its Ultium platform. With Ford’s market capitalization currently at $40.64 billion and analysts forecasting a sales decline this year, the automotive industry’s transformation continues to present both challenges and opportunities for established manufacturers.

In other recent news, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: ) announced a recall of nearly 1.1 million vehicles in the United States due to a software issue affecting rearview cameras. This precautionary measure impacts various models from 2021 to 2024, including the Bronco and F-150, to mitigate potential accident risks. Meanwhile, Bernstein has increased its price target for Ford stock to $8.30, although it maintains an Underperform rating, citing potential market challenges later in 2025 despite a strong first half. In a leadership update, Ford appointed Kyle Crockett as the new Chief Accounting Officer, effective after the second quarter financial report, succeeding Mark Kosman. Crockett’s extensive experience is expected to enhance Ford’s financial operations. Additionally, Ford’s production facilities in Cologne, Germany, are facing potential disruptions due to a planned strike, with further details yet to be disclosed. In response to recent U.S. tariffs, Ford has raised prices on models produced in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E, Maverick, and Bronco Sport, with increases up to $2,000.

The announcement took place at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo. Toyota will supply its hydrogen-powered fuel cell modules for Rehlko’s stationary power generators.

The agreement combines Rehlko’s energy solution experience with Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell technology.

“Toyota is excited to work with Rehlko on helping to build strong energy solutions using our proven, scalable fuel cell technology,” said Thibaut de Barros Conti, general manager, Toyota Hydrogen Solutions. “Integrating Rehlko’s systems with Toyota’s fuel cell technology has the potential to yield cleaner, reliable and more sustainable energy. It can scale based on the needs of customers and society and enable smart, energy-independent mobility for all.”

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Generators for Commercial Use

Interest in hydrogen fuel cell generators continues to grow for stationary power. Rehlko will integrate Toyota’s fuel cell systems into generators that match conventional standards.

These generators will power critical facilities such as data centers and warehouses. They help shield operations from harsh weather and grid failures by producing only water and air as emissions.

“The 1MW fuel cell generator represents a significant step forward in energy resilience for mission-critical customers. It delivers the same reliability, but helps customers meet their resilience goals by cutting local emissions to zero,” said Charles Hunsucker, President, Power Systems at Rehlko. “This technology is ready for orders today.”

Proven Projects Lay the Foundation

Rehlko and Toyota first collaborated on a 100kW hydrogen fuel cell generator at Klickitat Valley Health in Washington. After proving the concept, the companies built a commercial 1MW system. Rehlko led the development while Toyota supplied the core fuel cell technology.

Toyota has spent more than 30 years advancing hydrogen fuel cell research. The company started with the Toyota Mirai and now scales the technology for broader uses. Toyota tests systems in diverse environments and runs operations in Southern California and Kentucky.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) says it has installed over 6,300 EV charging ports across Northern and Central California. To meet rising demand, the company introduced a new method that speeds up EV fast-charging and battery site connections for PG&E EV charging infrastructure.

PG&E introduced the Flexible Service Connection, or Flex Connect, to let customers with controllable power needs, like EV chargers, connect to the grid without waiting for upgrades. Flex Connect uses PG&E’s cloud-based Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) to coordinate power demand based on available electricity. This technology allows faster integration while PG&E completes long-term upgrades. PG&E developed DERMS with Microsoft and Schneider Electric. The system forecasts power limits daily, helping customers plan ahead.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rehlko-FC-Toyota-1400.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 09:09:19.931393

We need a new kind of support ecosystem that moves at the speed of ideas, the big ideas.
When I launched BAMF Health, the technology we were building didn’t exist.
This is not about BAMF Health.
Anthony Chang, PhD, Founder and CEO of BAMF Health","Michigan has always been a place where impossible ideas become reality. Our state is the birthplace of Ford and GM, Kellogg and Meijer, Acrisure and Rocket Companies, Steelcase and Whirlpool. When they were founded, they weren’t just companies — they were revolutions. Each began with a bold vision and a refusal to back down.

As the founder and CEO of BAMF Health, I draw on that same spirit. Headquartered in Grand Rapids, we are building a platform that is redefining how cancer and other diseases are diagnosed and treated. BAMF stands for Bold Advanced Medical Future — not just a name, but a mindset. One rooted in believing the impossible is not just worth pursuing, it’s our responsibility.

Innovation no longer follows the linear path it did when Ford launched his assembly line. The startup environment is fundamentally different. For entrepreneurs today, it takes the same grit and determination, but true success demands bigger risks and faster speed. We need a new kind of support ecosystem that moves at the speed of ideas, the big ideas. It must start with a paradigm shift in mindset.

When I launched BAMF Health, the technology we were building didn’t exist. The field of medicine we were advancing— theranostics — was almost virtually unknown in the U.S. There was no blueprint. No playbook. No metrics to benchmark. We were navigating uncharted waters, learning as we went, while simultaneously constructing an aircraft carrier. What we needed wasn’t just funding, but belief. We needed people and institutions to understand the true meaning of risk-taking for revolution to happen. That’s the kind of support system we must create in Michigan.

We can no longer rely on outdated evaluation models to judge the value of future-shaping ideas. Innovators pushing into new frontiers — whether it’s biotech, AI, energy, or beyond — won’t look like traditional businesses. They won’t fit familiar molds. But that’s the point. If Michigan wants to lead again, we need to bet on the bold and get rid of nonsense.

We need: Legislators who champion future-focused policy; Educators who build talent pipelines for industries not yet at scale; Engineers who invent what doesn’t yet exist; and investors who fund what isn’t yet certain.

We need people who aren’t afraid to move fast, fail fast, and try again even faster. Because when lives are at stake, “someday” isn’t good enough.

This is not about BAMF Health. It’s about what’s next. We can turn Michigan into the most fertile ground for new ideas in the country, but only if we stop clinging to what’s worked in the past. We must shift from a mindset of protecting certainty to a culture that embraces possibility.

Henry Ford’s first company failed. But failure is part of the process. Today’s disruptors need the freedom to stumble, iterate, and come back faster and stronger.

Michigan has every asset it needs: talent, grit, philanthropy and heart. But now we need courage. Courage to take risks, to move faster, and to build the future before it’s obvious to everyone else. If we succeed, we won’t just change Michigan, we’ll change the world.

Let’s stop waiting for perfect conditions. Let’s bet on the bold — because the future belongs to those who dare to build it.

“Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision,” Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff said.

All submitted comments are included in the Detroit District’s administrative record, analyzed, and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS and other parts of the District’s review, as applicable.

“Even when operating under emergency procedures, the Detroit District remains committed to following the NEPA process,” said Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff.

The Line 5 Tunnel Project is a proposal by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (Enbridge) to construct a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan. The tunnel would house a replacement segment of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Detroit District is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application (File LRE-2010-00463-56-A19) pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for a Department of the Army permit.

The EIS assesses the potential impacts of the Line 5 Tunnel Project and project alternatives (including the No Action alternative, an alternative that would install a protective gravel/rock cover over the existing Dual Pipelines in the Straits, and multiple pipeline decommissioning sub-alternatives, if the proposed tunnel were to be permitted) to land use and recreation; aesthetics; water resources; biological resources; cultural resources; geology; soils; transportation and navigation; air quality; noise and vibration; socioeconomics; and reliability and safety.

In addition to its consideration of cultural resources in the EIS, the Corps of Engineers is separately evaluating impacts to historic properties, as well as impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act

The Corps of Engineers is also conducting a treaty rights analysis in consultation with federally recognized Tribes to determine if the proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project would impinge upon or abrogate treaty rights. Findings of the Section 106 process and treaty rights analysis will be presented in the Record of Decision following release of the Final EIS.

The Record of Decision date is anticipated in fall 2025.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Lt. Col. Bandeff said. “These processes will inform the District’s permit decision.”

A ‘costly attack’ on US renewables Much of the impetus behind these cancellations comes from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut support for renewable energy manufacturing, seen most sharply in the House of Representatives’ passage of a bill that will slash almost all Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits for renewable energy projects.
While the bill needs to pass the Senate, and so is still subject to change, the severity of cuts suggests that the president will do more to undermine the US renewable energy sector than many assumed.
Last year, Wood Mackenzie said that it would be “unlikely” a second Trump presidency would significantly undermine federal support for renewable energy projects, such as the IRA.
The analyst argued that many Republican states have benefited from IRA policies, which have helped create new jobs and secure US energy independence, regardless of individual politicians’ scepticism regarding the value of renewable energy power.","There is a clear relationship between the cancellation of projects and Trump taking office in January, with the 21 projects scrapped in just the first four months of this year already more than the 15 projects cancelled in the whole of 2024. This trend is shown in the graph below.

While this has not led to a complete withdrawal of investment in new clean energy projects – E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker report that businesses announced nearly US$500 million in new solar, electric vehicle (EV) and grid facilities in April alone – their figures suggest that more investment has been cancelled thus far in 2025 than announced in new projects. Indeed, 2025 is on pace for around US$42 billion in cancelled investment, a figure that would be more than double the total investment announced for the clean energy sector in 2024.

The majority of these project cancellations have been in the storage and EV sectors, with E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker reporting that investors in these industries have scrapped US$10.3 billion and US$6.3 billion of investment so far this year, respectively.

This is not entirely surprising as these sectors have seen the most total investment announced – US$42.2 billion in storage and US$82.4 billion in EVs – but the proportion of cancelled funding as a percentage of new funding announced is striking; project cancellations in the storage sector are valued at around one-quarter of the new funding announced this year, the second-largest proportion behind only the wind sector. These trends are shown in the graph above.

The solar industry, meanwhile, has emerged relatively unscathed so far this year. Its lost investments of US$2.9 billion are smaller than similar cancellations in the wind, storage and EV sectors, and only one solar project has been scrapped so far this year, fewer than any other technology type, including green hydrogen. Indeed, just six solar projects have been cancelled since 2023, according to data tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, compared to six wind projects, 13 storage projects and 16 EV projects. This trend is shown in the graph below.

Indeed, the only solar generation project to be consolidated in 2025 is the Ivanpah facility near the Nevada-California border, a 392MW concentrated solar plant that will slash its capacity by two-thirds and transition to solar PV generation.

The other five cancellations have been in the manufacturing sector, and include Meyer Burger’s abandonment of module production in Arizona, which was announced earlier today, and REC Silicon’s termination of polysilicon in Washington following a failed purity test last December.

A ‘costly attack’ on US renewables

Much of the impetus behind these cancellations comes from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut support for renewable energy manufacturing, seen most sharply in the House of Representatives’ passage of a bill that will slash almost all Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits for renewable energy projects. While the bill needs to pass the Senate, and so is still subject to change, the severity of cuts suggests that the president will do more to undermine the US renewable energy sector than many assumed.

Last year, Wood Mackenzie said that it would be “unlikely” a second Trump presidency would significantly undermine federal support for renewable energy projects, such as the IRA. The analyst argued that many Republican states have benefited from IRA policies, which have helped create new jobs and secure US energy independence, regardless of individual politicians’ scepticism regarding the value of renewable energy power.

The E2 and Clean Economy Tracker figures show that the majority of cuts will affect Republican-led regions, with Republican districts losing more than US$12 billion in investment and over 13,000 jobs that were once announced.

Indeed, through April 2025, 61% of all clean energy projects announced, 72% of all new jobs created and 82% of total investments were made into districts represented by Republicans, suggesting that Trump considers regions governed by members of his own party acceptable collateral damage as he looks to cut support for renewable power.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on US manufacturing and jobs,” said Michal Timberlake, E2 communications director. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

There is also confusion regarding the impacts of the latest bill, with Mike Carr, head of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition telling PV Tech Premium last week that there may well be “unintended consequences on the manufacturing and deployment side.” Considering the scale of renewable energy investments already announced, even the slightest element of uncertainty seems to have been enough to encourage investors to pull the plug on their projects.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/meyer-burger.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:51.672267

But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.
Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit.
Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""
A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies.","A lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.

The case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a ""climate disaster,"" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.

Julie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — the hottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in King County Superior Court.

The suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the ""foreseeable loss of human life."" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.

""Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,"" the lawsuit says. ""Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.""

In a rapid attribution study released days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been ""virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.""

Representatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment on the wrongful death lawsuit. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available. Chevron didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Julie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct ""decades of misinformation.""

Fossil fuel companies already face dozens of other climate lawsuits filed by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.

Those kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judge recently dismissed a climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.

Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, Ted Boutrous, told WHYY that climate change is a ""policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.""

Other cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by oil and gas companies to block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justices turned down a request by Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a ""distraction"" and ""waste of taxpayer resources.""

However, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, the Justice Department sued Michigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.

Douglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.

""The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,"" Kysar said in an email to NPR. ""Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said under the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Republicans, new data studies from NERA Economic Consulting shows that repealing the clean energy tax credits could cause New York to lose up to 20,300 jobs as clean energy projects are canceled or scaled back due to lack of incentive, with a nearly $3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP and New Yorkers paying up to $650 in higher energy costs each year by 2032 if these cuts become law.

The Senate still needs to pass the bill before it would go on to President Trump for signature.

Schumer said the tax cut bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have gone to the buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

Eliminates the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit that supports American-made clean hydrogen, led by New York companies like Plug Power and Air Products, to be used for clean manufacturing and agriculture.

The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives have spurred over $5 billion worth of investments in clean manufacturing in New York, creating over 7,200 jobs. Schumer said if this House plan goes through, many of the clean energy projects spurred by the IRA could be forced to scale back or even stop and the workers laid off, and projects that otherwise would have come online will never come to fruition.

Notably, the IRA allows firms to develop and sell energy tax credits, as outlined here, to advance its goals of reducing emissions while also boosting domestic manufacturing and innovation.

In our last update, available here, we discussed how Trump's withdrawal from global climate agreements and open disdain for the ""Green New Deal"" signaled a deliberate shift away from clean energy, making a reversal of the IRA seem inevitable.

That reversal is now underway. As many feared, the House advanced its budget on May 22 summarized here, which would significantly pare back the IRA's clean energy initiatives to help offset the cost of other items, such as the anticipated extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") provisions.

Released under the banner of ""Working Families Over Elites,"" the bill would eliminate several consumer-facing tax credits, including credits for purchasing electric vehicles, installing charging infrastructure, and making home energy efficiency upgrades. Some limited exceptions would extend the ability to claim a credit through 2026.

The bill would also eliminate the credit for clean hydrogen production, widely viewed as one of the more innovative (if often misunderstood) technologies sanctioned by the IRA.

Most significantly, the bill would gut the technology-neutral investment tax credit (""ITC"") and production tax credit (""PTC"")—two of the cornerstones of the IRA, as we introduced here—by eliminating the credit for projects that have not begun construction within 60 days after the bill's enactment or are not placed in service before the end of 2028 (with an exception for qualifying nuclear facilities). The bill would also disallow the credit for residential wind and solar property that is leased to a third party.

Additionally, the bill would eliminate the ability to sell the clean fuel production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2027, the latter of which was on track to become one of the most widely claimed credits under the IRA. The bill would also eliminate transferability for the carbon sequestration credit two years after its enactment, along with the investment credit for certain energy property.

Although the IRA tax credits were structured as 10-year incentives set to expire after 2032, with some credits subject to phase-outs, the bill would shorten that timeline by terminating the nuclear power production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2031. It's possible that future revisions could further accelerate the phase-out of these credits, as proposed in the initial House draft.

Beyond these timing restrictions, the bill would impose ""foreign entity of concern"" limitations across several provisions—which we anticipated here—amid growing concerns over China's dominance in critical supply chains like solar panels, batteries and critical minerals.

But even as those restrictions gain political traction, the popularity of the credits has prompted a more cautious tone from some policymakers. Earlier in May, a group of House Republicans wrote a letter urging their colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee to preserve the IRA credits, citing both the need to position the U.S. as a global energy leader and concerns over rising energy costs. That warning, however, may have fallen on deaf ears.

The Tax Foundation estimates here that fully repealing the IRA's clean energy incentives would raise $851 billion. By contrast, the scaled-back proposal currently on the table would raise only about a third of that amount—leading some Republicans to argue that it doesn't go far enough.

Uncertainty persists, but as the IRA approaches its third anniversary, one thing is clear: the market for credit transfers is huge, with market analysts estimating that total volume exceeded $24 billion in 2024.

We will continue to monitor developments and provide updates in Brass Tax as the landscape continues to evolve.

The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.
The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law.
The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

But power plants, as the largest source of several harmful pollutants, are responsible for 50 percent of the emissions, more than 50 percent of acid gas emissions and about 25 percent of toxic metal emissions in the U.S. As for mercury, coal-fired power plants emit 99 percent of it and most of the other power-sector pollutants, the federal agency said.
Although dozens already meet at least some part of the proposed standards, 44 percent of the coal plants lack the advanced pollution-control equipment that these limits require.
“The updated standards will provide certainty and level the playing field so that all power plants will have to limit their toxic emissions,” the EPA said.
Coal-fired power plants are scattered on Native lands all across the U.S.","The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday issued the first-ever U.S. regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, a move that officials said would reduce 91 percent of the mercury in coal from being released into the air, improving public health.

“Today we’re taking an important step forward in EPA’s efforts to safeguard the health of millions of Americans,” EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said at a press conference to sign the new order, according to CNN. “Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution technologies to control and cut harmful emissions like mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases.”

The new rules will apply to all 1,350 of the country’s coal and oil-fired units that are in 525 power plants. These emit harmful pollutants that include mercury, arsenic, other toxic metals, acid gases and organic air toxics such as dioxin, the EPA said in summarizing the plan.

Two of the three industry sectors that contribute the bulk of mercury pollution—medical waste incinerators and municipal waste combustors—have already reduced their emissions by more than 95 percent, the EPA said. But power plants, as the largest source of several harmful pollutants, are responsible for 50 percent of the emissions, more than 50 percent of acid gas emissions and about 25 percent of toxic metal emissions in the U.S.

As for mercury, coal-fired power plants emit 99 percent of it and most of the other power-sector pollutants, the federal agency said.

Although dozens already meet at least some part of the proposed standards, 44 percent of the coal plants lack the advanced pollution-control equipment that these limits require.

“The updated standards will provide certainty and level the playing field so that all power plants will have to limit their toxic emissions,” the EPA said. Facilities have up to four years to meet the standards.

Coal-fired power plants are scattered on Native lands all across the U.S. The Navajo Nation has three, including the Navajo Generating Station, which according to the Grand Canyon Trust produces about a fifth of Arizona’s greenhouse gases, as well as being a major source of mercury and nitrogen pollution.

It’s too early to know if Trump’s plans will mean more energy projects get completed.","Brandon Tuck got a lot of calls when President Donald Trump began his drive to “unleash” American energy this year.

The Houston lawyer guides construction on big projects like pipelines. Clients rejoiced that “the seas had parted” after Trump’s barrage of executive orders and declaration of an energy emergency. But the waters, he would tell them, were still pretty treacherous.

“It’s a trap for the unwary,” Tuck said in an interview. “You might have your permit in six months if you use that emergency authority, but you might lose it in a year or two.”

That emergency authority is one in a suite of tools Trump has offered to fossil fuel companies to get permits faster and, therefore, build faster. But Tuck and others like him are warning that those tools can’t speed up projects as much as backers might hope.

In fact, Trump’s moves could backfire, leaving projects tied up in court for years.

People who shepherd big energy projects say shortcutting reviews, firing bureaucrats and demolishing well-established processes is not the way to make such problems go away. Reviews done too quickly can invite errors that opponents seize on in court. Permit backlogs can grow when regulatory agencies are short-staffed. And blowing up longstanding practices can leave developers without landmarks to navigate.

The reality is that, for now, not much in the U.S. government has changed outside of Trump’s executive branch.

Congress hasn’t repealed the environmental laws that guide permitting and set the parameters for environmental analysis. Lawmakers are weighing changes to pipeline permitting and the National Environmental Policy Act in the Republicans’ party-line “megabill,” but weeks of legislative haggling remain, if not more. A Thursday ruling by the Supreme Court limited the scope of environmental reviews. But agencies will still be required to thoroughly examine the direct effects of energy projects.

For now, judges are mostly working with the same statutes and case law they’ve used for decades when they consider environmental challenges to major projects.

“I wish I could point to something that the federal administration has done to speed up permitting,” said Jennifer Jeffers, who guides projects for clients of the Allen Matkins law firm in San Francisco, in an email exchange. “But so far most, if not all, of the administration’s efforts on the environmental front have been to dismantle agencies and eliminate federal jurisdictional oversight.“

Even if it is intended to speed up permitting, she said, that dismantling and eliminating will likely lead to delays, uncertainty and increased costs for developers.

But some experts who work with the fossil fuel industry aren’t worried about unintended consequences.

Jason Hill, a partner with the Holland & Knight law firm in Houston who served at the Interior Department in Trump’s first term, says he doesn’t expect the current administration to cut back on scientific analysis of projects. Instead, he said, it will light a fire under regulatory officials in Washington to make decisions.

That’s what they did in Trump’s first term, Hill said, to great effect.

“I haven’t seen any indication from my interactions with the government that they’re doing things any different or any less rigorous than they always have,” Hill said.

And even if they do complicate projects at first, Trump’s actions will improve permitting in the long run, said Tom Pyle, president of the conservative Institute for Energy Research think tank. But that’s not enough. To make permanent changes, he said, Congress needs to improve the process.

“It all points back to permitting,” he said.

The American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas trade association, offered similar sentiments, saying in an emailed statement that “durable reform” is needed for the federal permitting system.

But it’s far from clear what will reach Trump’s desk. The Senate is still working on its version. It’s not certain that the full Senate will agree to those provisions. Senators might not even be allowed to because, to avoid the Senate filibuster, all elements of the bill are expected to relate to budget matters.

Trump campaigned on a promise to drill more for oil and gas, though under former President Joe Biden, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever had. Hours after Trump was sworn in in January, he declared an “energy emergency” designed to bulldoze barriers to energy production, transportation and export.

The reason for that “emergency,” Trump said, was Biden — his administration’s approach to energy and his push to reduce the effects of climate change. But Biden’s administration had also claimed credit for getting environmental reviews done 23 percent faster than during Trump’s first term.

Oil industry leaders scoff at the idea that Biden improved federal process for permitting big projects.

“We certainly know that all the efforts prior to President Trump have not fixed the problem,” said John Stoody, a vice president with the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association. “So we appreciate whatever his administration can do to fix the broken permitting process.”

‘Twist of irony’

Since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, Trump and his appointees have cut a path of disruption through the conventional understanding of how energy and environmental policy works.

They revoked White House Council on Environmental Quality rules that have guided agencies and developers for decades. Then they directed permitting agencies to use their emergency powers to bypass environmental rules.

Tens of thousands of federal employees have departed because of Trump’s campaign, led by billionaire Elon Musk, to shrink the size of the federal workforce through retirements, incentives and mass layoffs. Musk this week announced he’ll soon end his work with the Department of Government Efficiency initiative he helped to launch and lead.

Among the high-profile moves to speed up projects: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s plan to cut environmental reviews of fossil fuel and mining projects from years down to no more than a month.

Taken together, those policies are probably the biggest offensive against environmental regulations since the laws they implement were written in the 1960s and 1970s. But whether the moves will truly unleash energy projects is unclear because the onslaught has left risk and uncertainty in its wake.

“In a twist of irony,” Jeffers’ firm said in an online post, Trump’s revocation of NEPA regulations, “could lead to greater delays in environmental reviews and permitting” for fossil fuel and mining projects, “at least in the near term.”

Trump administration officials’ push for agencies to use emergency authorities to speed projects will likely draw court challenges, Tuck said, because laws and regulations generally have very narrow criteria for what qualifies as an emergency.

“Our very consistent response is: ‘Be wary of anything they offer to shortcut,’” said Tuck, a partner at Vinson & Elkins.

Opponents of the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley gas pipelines accused agencies of taking such shortcuts to speed approval of the projects. They got a sympathetic ear from federal appeals court judges. Atlantic Coast got canceled after years of delays. The Mountain Valley gas pipeline finished more than five years late and billions of dollars over budget, and only after Congress and Biden rescued it.

Interior’s plan to shrink the time for environmental assessments (EA) to 14 days and environmental impact statements to 28 days, was “much more aggressive than anything I anticipated,” said Hill, the Interior Department veteran. He’s watching for details.

“It’s one thing to say you’re going to do an EA in 14 days,” he said. “It’s another thing to say how you’re going to do that, and I don’t think that granular level of detail has been provided.”

Tuck said he expects the overhaul to change the order in which tasks are done, not make the process 10 times faster. Developers will need to spend more time and money before applying for an EA or environmental impact statement (EIS) to ensure they’ve provided everything regulatory agencies will need. Only after that can they expect such a quick decision.

“Nobody’s writing an EIS in 28 days. That’s fanciful,” Tuck said. “What they’re saying is, you give us all the information, all the analysis, and we’ll review it and process it posthaste. But how long does it take clients to develop that information? Oh, you know, many, many months — a year, a year and a half, two years.”

The purges of Trump and Musk have been promoted as a way to save money. But energy experts say they could wind up costing project developers a lot of time. The aggressive approach Trump and Musk used to thin the ranks may also have hit the people who could move projects along.

When CEO Amy Andryszak of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America presented a list of changes to laws that could speed interstate gas pipeline projects to a House subcommittee last month, she didn’t mention Musk’s chainsaw approach or the Trump administration’s “Reduction in Force” push. But she did add that “adequate staffing and expertise across federal agencies” was also important.

“If we are going to build the infrastructure necessary to meet growing energy demand and the administration’s goals of American energy dominance,” she said in a statement emailed to POLITICO’s E&E News, “we need agencies with the resources and personnel necessary to ensure the certification and development of the aforementioned infrastructure.”

Hill said he’s confident the administration has been careful to keep the federal employees needed to keep the permits flowing.

But federal employees can do more than just process permits. Agencies can sometimes actively help move projects through the process. But they can’t if they don’t have enough staff.

As an example, Tuck said the Army Corps of Engineers has long done wetland delineations, for landowners, showing which parts of their property can be developed without Clean Water Act concerns. At one point, the agency was able to perform them even for those not seeking permits.

But even before Musk opened the throttle on his chainsaw, Tuck said, the Army Corps was cutting back. With the mass exodus from federal offices, he expects the agency will be able to do even fewer.

It’s too early to know if Trump’s plans will mean more energy projects get completed. But at least one big energy project has been slowed by the Trump administration itself.

Empire Wind 1, a New York wind energy project, was stalled by the Trump administration in April, though it had all its permits and construction had started. Trump recently relented and allowed work to resume. That has fueled speculation that, in return, Trump expects to get the Constitution natural gas pipeline built through New York. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said there is no such “deal.” The developer of that project, Williams Cos., announced Thursday it is reviving the project and another pipeline planned for the Northeast.

The saga illustrates the danger to developers from shifting political priorities.

Such moves have happened in other administrations. One of Biden’s first actions was to cancel the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was designed to move Canadian oil into the United States. Former president Barack Obama put the Dakota Access pipeline on ice when protests heated up in North Dakota. The project was rescued by Trump and now moves oil from the Bakken play to the Midwest.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d1/00/26b3ef274e3eb1f17c40dc6a4381/ew-0517-farah-pipelines-1160-01.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:52.067774

The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon.","(AP) – In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother’s fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car’s air conditioning wasn’t working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company. ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday’s filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.”

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.”

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming — somewhat unsuccessfully. Hawaii and Michigan, for example, recently announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, and they have been met by a counter lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department.

The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, again; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change; and the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company’s greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”",https://www.kxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/climate-change-e1665089100819.jpg?icb=1748613367,N,,2025-05-30 10:03:59.793386

Meanwhile, the lab’s federal employees — like other EPA employees throughout the agency — have been given the option to retire early, leave voluntarily or apply for a limited number of jobs at other divisions within the agency.

More than two months after the Trump administration’s plans to cut the EPA’s Office of Research and Development were first reported by the New York Times, uncertainty still swirls around the future of EPA’s Great Lakes Toxicology and Ecology Division Laboratory, 6201 Congdon Blvd., which is part of ORD.

A portion of the reduction plan, shared earlier this year with the News Tribune by Science Committee Democratic staff, said the EPA planned to “eliminate” the ORD and expected 50%-75% of its more than 1,540 positions ""will not be retained.""

Earlier this month, the Trump administration submitted its budget to Congress, which called for a $235 million, or 45%, cut in ORD’s budget.

According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, and a recording of a May 2 virtual meeting obtained by the News Tribune, EPA officials told ORD employees that they could apply to approximately 500 job openings at other offices within the EPA.

Job applications for the new positions and decisions on early retirement or the so-called deferred resignation program were all due a week later, on May 9.

Questions about relocation for the new jobs, however, linger. While one official said the 130 new jobs within the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention would not require relocation and gave Duluth as an example of a place the staffer could remain, a slide showing the organization the newly created Office of Applied Sciences and Environmental Solutions, which account for 300 of the new jobs, only listed locations in Oklahoma, Ohio, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.

Officials said another 30-50 positions would be available at the Office of Air and Radiation and told staff at ORD they could also apply for new positions in the Office of Water.

Questions on the future of ORD were often answered by officials who said the latest plans didn’t directly affect ORD and that more reorganization plans were coming.

Less than a week later, as the May 9 deadline loomed, ORD staff were told, “If you’re interested in remaining with the Agency, we encourage you to apply for any and all of the positions you may be qualified for,” according to an email reviewed by the News Tribune.

However, any mass layoffs appear to be on hold after a federal judge earlier this month blocked the Trump administration from large-scale reductions in force or agency reorganizations of federal agencies, including the EPA, “without partnering with Congress.”

Even so, the lab’s workforce has dropped by about 25 over the last month when a grant was cut and a contract left to expire, both of which allowed early-career researchers to work alongside EPA scientists at the lab. Prior to that, there were 176 employees at the lab, 68 of whom were federal scientists, and the remaining 108 were post-doctoral researchers, student contractors and facility staff, according to an EPA fact sheet updated in April.

It’s unclear how many employees took an early retirement or deferred resignation.

In response to the News Tribune’s request for an interview on what the agency’s reorganization effort and cancellation of the grant and contract meant for the future of the Duluth lab, an EPA spokesperson responded with a brief statement.

“At ORD (Office of Research and Development) and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing to invest in research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” a spokesperson for the EPA said.

A five-year National Student Services Contract between the EPA and Oak Ridge Associated Universities that allowed earlier career researchers to work alongside EPA scientists at seven ORD labs and offices, including Duluth, expired May 14 and a new contract was not approved.

ORAU did not respond to the News Tribune’s request for comment. Multiple sources estimated that approximately 20 researchers, ranging from undergraduates to postdocs, at the Duluth Lab were let go when the contract expired. On its website, ORAU has removed employee spotlight pages that once highlighted the work of its researchers working with the EPA. It also replaced a page of contract information with a thank-you message.

“ORAU would like to thank EPA for 10 years of successful partnership managing the National Student Services Contract (NSSC),” the website said this week. “We would also like to thank all of our employees who worked side by side with the hardworking federal employees at EPA.“

Last month, the EPA cut a $3.5 million grant that trained undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Minnesota Duluth in chemical risk management and water quality protection.

The grant began in November 2023 and was expected to last five years, but it ended abruptly April 30, with a notice from the EPA stating the grant was terminated immediately because the “objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” a UMD spokesperson said.

More than $800,000 had been obligated when the grant was cut, with almost $300,000 already paid to the university, according to USASpending.gov.

The Department of Government Efficiency, President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s effort to slash federal spending and programming, now lists the cutting of the grant as a savings on its so-called “Wall of Receipts.”

In a statement, Donn Branstrator, professor of biology at UMD, said the school requested “an orderly closeout” so it can continue the contract until next spring.

“Water quality protection is of vital importance for Minnesotans and people across the country, and the EPA and UMD scientists have a long and productive track record of collaboration in research and student training,” Branstrator said. “Without this funding, the region and the nation will lose out on the training and career development of current and future scientists committed to protecting the environment.”

A UMD spokesperson said one postdoctoral investigator and four graduate students from UMD were in training when the grant was cut, and another two graduate students were expected to begin in the fall. The grant cut affects an additional 15 undergraduate students, seven graduate students and three postdoctoral investigators who would have been trained in aquatic toxicology and ecology.

A letter sent in April by U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, both Democrats from Minnesota, to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding answers about the future of the Duluth lab has not been answered by the agency, Smith’s office said. The two sent a follow-up letter to Zeldin urging him to respond to their earlier letter and confirm the EPA would not attempt to reduce staff at the Duluth lab while the court's injunction on large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations is in effect.

In a statement Thursday, Smith said the lab in Duluth and its work on clean and safe water were irreplaceable because of its access to Lake Superior.

“I’m extremely concerned that workers at the lab aren’t getting the clarity they deserve about what’s going on. They are being left in the dark, not knowing if their jobs are safe,” Smith said. “The Trump administration needs to listen to the federal court order temporarily halting any proposed cuts to the lab, but unfortunately this administration has shown a blatant disregard for rule of law and court orders. I’m disappointed the Trump EPA can’t answer a series of simple questions about the future of the lab and these workers, but I’m not giving up.”

In a separate statement Thursday, Klobuchar echoed the need to keep the Duluth lab open.

“The Duluth lab is critical for the Northland and the Great Lakes in a big way — ensuring safe drinking water and supporting our recreation and shipping economy — which is why I continue to press the administration to keep the lab open,” Klobuchar said.

“While the courts have stepped in to block these across-the-board changes, we must continue to protect our Northland and the Great Lakes,"" she said. ""I support making the government more efficient, but it must be done in a way that is based on facts and science, without threatening our economy or putting public health on the line.”

State Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, also wrote a letter to Zeldin in April, but had not received a response as of Tuesday, a spokesperson for his office said.

U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., said he recently met with EPA Region 5 Administrator Anne Vogel.

“Congressman Stauber did express his desire for the Duluth Research Lab to remain open due to the important research they perform around the Great Lakes,"" a spokesperson for the Hermantown lawmaker's office said Thursday. ""There is no new update on the status of this lab, and Regional Administrator Vogel relayed to the congressman that this decision ultimately remains with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.""",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/2e92651/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1598x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F90%2F2a%2Fe94eedde4722a209625660be9224%2Fepa-c09.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:14:28.252921

Many people were shocked when Elon Musk decided to back Donald Trump and the Republican Party, considering they have consistently attacked clean energy and electric vehicles, which are Tesla’s main products.

The GOP has been undermining renewable energy for years, and it doesn’t look like Musk’s $300 million donation to Trump and influence on the GOP were able to change that, as the latest budget to pass the GOP controlled-Congress undoes a lot of progress made by the Biden administration on clean energy and electric vehicle adoption.

The budget removes the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which is a big part of Tesla’s success in the US. It also kills incentives to build batteries in the US – another incentive that greatly benefited Tesla.

It also removes 30% tax credit on battery storage and solar, which greatly helped Tesla’s energy division.

Yesterday, Tesla issued a statement calling for the Trump government to gradually phase out those incentives rather than removing them altogether:

Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.

Musk shared the statement and then added that while the government that he helped elect is removing incentives for electric vehicles and clean energy, it is not removing those for oil and gas:

The US is incentivizing the oil and gas industry at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars per year.

Before backing Trump and the Republican Party, Musk had stated that he would be for the removal of EV and clean energy incentives if incentives for fossil fuels were also removed.

Musk has officially exited the Trump administration this week.

Electrek’s Take

It’s interesting to see Musk finally speaking out, albeit weakly, against some of Trump’s policies for the first time. He did note that the budget bill would increase the deficit, and now this.

A quick reminder that Musk said that Trump was the “only one who could save the Western world” and that if he is not elected, the US is basically done.

His stated goals with Trump were to “kill the woke mind virus” and get the deficit and debt under control.

The US has never been more divided, and Trump is pushing a budget that would add about $4 trillion to the US debt over the next few years. His backing of Trump hasn’t achieved anything meaningful toward those goals. Of course, Musk’s real goal in backing Trump was likely to get federal regulators and agencies that were closing in on him and his businesses off his back.

He was successful in doing that, but at what cost?

The EV tax credit is a significant factor in maintaining Tesla’s demand in the US, which is essentially its last primary market where it sells vehicles at a profit.

The removal of the 30% ITC for solar and energy storage would significantly slow down Tesla’s energy storage business, which has been its only growing business for the last two years.

In short, the budget would greatly weaken Tesla’s business in the US, which was its last remaining market that wasn’t doing too badly. Canada is gone. Europe is gone, and Tesla is facing tremendous pressure from competition in China.",https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/electrek.png?w=32,N,,2025-05-30 08:01:29.650603

U.S. farmers are calling on the federal government to boost domestic biofuel use as they deal with falling exports and growing crop surpluses due to trade disputes.

Following trade wars, especially with China, many growers have no foreign buyers for their upcoming soybean, corn, and wheat harvests.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to release a new plan on renewable volume obligations (RVOs), which dictate how much biofuel must be blended into traditional fuels.

Farmers and agricultural groups are asking for higher mandates to create new markets and reduce reliance on exports.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” said Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association. “I can store one good crop; I can’t store multiple years.”

Export data shows soybean sales are down 79% and corn sales are 49% below the five-year average. These issues come on top of global grain oversupply, which has already hurt prices. A 2022 grain price peak has since dropped by more than 40%.

Major agribusinesses and farm groups want the EPA to mandate at least 5.25 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel and maintain 15 billion gallons of ethanol.

Surprisingly, even the American Petroleum Institute supports this, aligning with farmers to boost biofuel use.

Still, not everyone agrees. Some oil refiners say there’s not enough gasoline sold to support such high ethanol levels and question whether feedstock supply is enough for increased renewable diesel production.

The industry’s concerns are valid. Biodiesel plants are operating at just 51% of their capacity, while renewable diesel facilities are running at 72%. This has impacted farmers’ ability to move their crops.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” said Peter Zonneveld of biofuel firm Neste Oyj.

The EPA confirmed it has sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House for review. The plan supports “President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices.”

With reduced cattle herds and shrinking exports, farmers believe a robust domestic market for biofuels could be key to economic recovery.

Critics say it's overestimating,Emily Jones,,,,,https://www.wabe.org/georgia-power-is-planning-for-a-huge-spike-in-energy-demand-critics-say-the-utility-is-overestimating/,"But some critics argue Georgia Power’s predictions are too high.
Energy experts testifying before the Georgia Public Service Commission this week cast doubt on Georgia Power’s prediction of a massive, rapid increase in energy demand — known as load.
Georgia Power made its case to the commission over several days of hearings in March.
They argued that Georgia Power isn’t properly accounting for the chance that data center projects could fall through.
That’s possible largely thanks to the increased revenue Georgia Power is expecting from new, large customers — like data centers.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

Georgia’s largest electric utility is preparing to meet what it says is a huge spike in new electricity demand. Georgia Power says it expects it will need to provide 8,200 more megawatts by 2031 – about four times the energy made by its brand-new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

A key factor driving Georgia Power’s plans is the enormous growth in need the company says it expects over the next few years from large industrial customers — especially data centers.

But some critics argue Georgia Power’s predictions are too high. Energy experts testifying before the Georgia Public Service Commission this week cast doubt on Georgia Power’s prediction of a massive, rapid increase in energy demand — known as load.

“We conclude that the forecast produced by Georgia Power is likely skewed to show load realization sooner and in greater quantity than is likely to materialize,” said Robert Trokey, who leads the electric unit of the Public Service Commission’s staff.

Getting that forecast wrong could have major implications for customer bills and for climate change.

The commission last year approved new natural gas turbines and battery storage that Georgia Power asked for in an emergency request driven largely by expected data center demand.

Now, the commissioners are considering the utility’s new long-term energy plan as part of a regularly-scheduled regulatory proceeding.

The plan calls for keeping coal plants open longer, upgrading nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, adding solar and improving power lines.

Georgia Power made its case to the commission over several days of hearings in March. This week, the commission’s public interest advocacy staff and the intervenors — environmental and consumer advocacy groups, municipal governments, industry groups and large power buyers like MARTA and Walmart — responded with their own expert testimony.

Several of them simply did not buy Georgia Power’s predictions.

“The way the company has treated its load forecast is deeply flawed,” said energy planning consultant Derek Stenclik, who testified on behalf of the Sierra Club, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Natural Resources Defense Council. “I would even call it utility planning malpractice.”

He and other analysts said the currently-booming data center industry is too new to make confident predictions. They argued that Georgia Power isn’t properly accounting for the chance that data center projects could fall through.

To make forecasts for big customers like data centers and factories, Georgia Power experts run projects in various stages of development through mathematical models that predict how likely the projects are to actually open and how much power they’ll need.

But the company uses different calculations for data centers, predicting they’re more likely to come to fruition than other potential customers like factories and warehouses.

The company doesn’t have data to back up that different math, Trokey argued. Others questioned whether Georgia Power’s modeling adequately accounts for canceled projects.

Officials with the utility maintain their modeling is based on real projects, factoring in how far along the data centers are in the development pipeline and whether data center developers have signed a contract to buy energy from Georgia Power. In the earlier hearings in March, company officials said that any cancelled data center projects had so far been quickly replaced by new ones.

During this week’s hearings, commissioners expressed little patience for skepticism from experts and advocates about the company’s forecast for data center-driven demand.

“Obviously the company believes it’s real because they’re putting them under contract,” said Commissioner Tricia Pridemore. “The state of Georgia believes it’s real. Georgia Department of Economic Development has been involved. The Governor’s been involved. Commissioners have been involved. We’ve worked on these projects, in some cases for years.”

Georgia Power’s forecast is critical because it shapes how the utility plans to be able to meet future, predicted demand.

If the company overestimates, Stenclik and others argued, it risks spending too much on the infrastructure to make and deliver extra energy, and regular customers could end up paying for it. If it underestimates, the company contends, energy reliability could be at risk.

Much of the company’s plan to meet its forecast in the near term relies on fossil fuels, which many public commenters opposed because they contribute to climate change. They urged the commission to consider the impacts of climate change before approving any new or extended use of coal or natural gas.

Considering rates later

The power rates that customers pay, though based on the need to pay for construction and other expenses approved in the energy plan under consideration, are not a part of the current hearings before the commission.

Instead, rates are typically decided during a subsequent proceeding called a rate case.

But rates are top of mind for many Georgia Power customers because their bills have increased six times in the last three years: three rate hikes approved in the last rate case in 2022, two to pay for new reactors at Plant Vogtle, and a separate bill increase to cover high natural gas costs.

This year, the utility and commission staff have proposed an agreement that would freeze rates for now, bypassing the regular rate case. That’s possible largely thanks to the increased revenue Georgia Power is expecting from new, large customers — like data centers.

The commission has also taken steps to help ensure data center companies and other large customers pay for their own infrastructure. But witnesses in this week’s hearings questioned whether those measures are sufficient to protect residents and small businesses from extra costs.

Energy analysts for the commission’s staff also said they’re concerned about rates increasing for other reasons, like cleaning up storm damage and complying with environmental regulations. The deal to freeze rates already includes a plan to address the costs of Hurricane Helene next year.

Upcoming elections

Two of the five commissioners who will vote later this year on both Georgia Power’s long-term plan and the proposed rate freeze are up for election in November. Early voting in the primary has already begun.

This week, one candidate in that primary was disqualified for failing to fulfill residency requirements. He has since said he appealed the decision.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2025/01/AP25031833551773-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:13:54.755522

Total installed clean power capacity in the USA reached over 320 GW by the end of March 2025. The 115 project phases that came online in the first quarter represent $10 billion in private investment.

Battery storage capacity exceeded 30 GW for the first time, reflecting a 65% year-on-year increase. The quarter added 1,602 MW of new storage—a record for Q1.

The development pipeline grew by 12% compared to Q1 2024 and now stands at 184,418 MW. Storage and wind pipelines saw year-on-year growth of 57% and 24% respectively. If fully realised, these projects would represent \$328 billion in future investment. The pipeline includes projects already permitted or in advanced development but does not reflect an increase in permitting activity.

New additions in Q1 2025 included 4,459 MW of utility-scale solar, 1,602 MW of battery storage and 1,327 MW of land-based wind.

Texas remains the national leader in clean power deployment, with more than 80 GW of total capacity—up 20% since Q1 2024. The state ranks first for both utility-scale solar (28 GW) and land-based wind (43 GW).",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-30 11:12:58.369317

The WMO projects that the global average temperature will exceed 1.5°C above preindustrial levels by 2027, a full decade earlier than previously predicted, due to record-breaking heat and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions.

The shift is driven by compounding factors: stronger El Niño events, declining air pollution that had temporarily cooled the planet, and limited progress in reducing fossil fuel dependence despite the rise of renewables.

Scientists warn that sustained warming at this level could trigger irreversible climate tipping points, including the collapse of coral reefs and melting of polar ice, putting new pressure on policymakers to adjust global climate goals.

Key quote:

“There is no way, barring geoengineering, to prevent global temperatures from going over 1.5 degrees.”

— Zeke Hausfather, climate scientist and climate research lead at Stripe

Why this matters:

Passing the 1.5°C mark has serious consequences. At this level of warming, scientists expect more extreme and frequent weather events, including severe heat waves, crop failures, and ecosystem collapses. Coral reefs, already under stress, face near-total extinction. Polar ice loss could accelerate sea-level rise, putting coastal cities and small island nations at risk. Infectious diseases spread more readily in warmer conditions, and heat-related health problems multiply, especially in already vulnerable communities. Although the world agreed to try to limit warming below this threshold in 2015 at COP21 in Paris, fossil fuel emissions have continued largely unabated, and the energy transition remains too slow. The WMO’s new timeline pulls the future into the present, showing that climate change is no longer a distant threat — it’s here now, and speeding up. It will likely reshape global economies, health systems, and geopolitics in unpredictable and dangerous ways.

In short:

The 8-0 ruling curbs how NEPA can be used, limiting environmental reviews to only the immediate effects of projects like rail lines and pipelines.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh emphasized that NEPA is procedural, not a weapon to block development, and courts must defer to agencies on what they include in their reviews.

Environmental advocates argue this decision ignores the full chain of climate and health harms — like pollution from oil refining or increased risks to frontline communities.

Key quote:

“Fossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution.”

— Nathaniel Shoaff, senior attorney at the Sierra Club

Why this matters:

The Supreme Court just shrank one of the most important tools the public has to fight environmentally risky projects at a time when fossil fuel projects are expanding. NEPA has long been a way for communities to slow — or at least understand — the consequences of big infrastructure plans. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the rest of the bench are reframing it as a box-checking exercise. This ruling allows agencies to decide what counts as worth reviewing, and courts are told to back off.

In short:

A German appeals court rejected Saúl Luciano Lliuya’s claim that RWE should pay for flood prevention measures near his Peruvian home, citing only a 1% flood risk to his property over 30 years.

The court, however, affirmed that German civil law could allow victims of climate change to hold major emitters accountable, setting a legal precedent for similar suits worldwide.

While RWE claimed the lawsuit was unfounded and outside German jurisdiction, climate advocates see the ruling as a turning point for global corporate climate liability cases.

Key quote:

“For the first time in history, a higher court in Europe has ruled that large emitters can be held responsible for the consequences of their greenhouse gas emissions.”

— Roda Verheyen, lawyer for plaintiff Saúl Luciano Lliuya

Why this matters:

As climate change escalates, courts are emerging as battlegrounds for accountability. Lawsuits like the one filed by Luciano Lliuya reflect the frustration of people whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by floods, fires, droughts, and other climate-related disasters, yet who see little recourse through politics or diplomacy. Though his specific claim failed, the German court’s recognition of potential corporate liability for emissions lays the groundwork for a wave of new climate litigation. Legal systems are starting to catch up with scientific consensus: Emissions don’t respect borders, and neither should responsibility. This is especially important as wealthier nations and corporations disproportionately contribute to global emissions, while the consequences often hit poorer communities hardest.

In short:

A large section of the Birch Glacier broke off above the Lötschental valley, releasing a surge of debris that covered about 90% of Blatten, a village of 300 people that had been evacuated on May 19.

Authorities said one person remains missing after the collapse, which also buried the Lonza riverbed and could lead to dammed water and further hazards.

Emergency services closed access to the valley, while Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed support for the displaced community, promising solidarity.

Key quote:

“An unbelievable amount of material thundered down into the valley.”

— Matthias Ebener, spokesperson for local authorities in the southwestern canton of Valais

Why this matters:

Switzerland’s Alpine villages have long been seen as stable havens, but melting glaciers and destabilized mountain slopes are turning these once-predictable landscapes into zones of mounting risk. Climate change accelerates glacial melt, reducing the ice that once held rocky slopes in place and increasing the chances of sudden collapses. What happened in Blatten is a warning: As permafrost thaws and weather patterns shift, communities built on centuries of tradition may face more frequent and violent geological threats. It’s not only about property loss or emergency response — these disasters also reshape the land and alter water systems, from river flow to potable water supplies.

In short:

A Boston University analysis found 68% of China’s overseas energy investments in 2022–2023 went to solar and wind, up from just 13% between 2000 and 2021.

While new coal plant financing has stopped, earlier investments continue to result in new coal power plants coming online, which could emit as much CO₂ annually as Austria.

China’s shift is partly driven by a need to export surplus renewable technology amid economic challenges and has included a recent $51 billion pledge to support low-carbon energy in Africa.

Key quote:

China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.”

— Xi Jinping, president of China

Why this matters:

The shift in China's overseas energy financing has far-reaching implications for both global carbon emissions and the geopolitics of clean energy. While Beijing's move away from coal-backed infrastructure projects aligns with climate goals, the follow-through on existing fossil fuel investments continues to embed long-term carbon pollution in developing nations. These coal projects, built decades after wealthy nations began cutting back on such infrastructure, risk locking lower-income countries into emissions-intensive economies just as the global push to decarbonize accelerates. Environmental groups remain concerned about how this dual strategy affects vulnerable regions, especially as countries in Africa and Southeast Asia weigh economic growth against environmental health. With the U.S. government retreating from global climate cooperation under the Trump administration, China’s approach may increasingly shape which technologies and environmental practices take hold in emerging markets.

In short:

Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb is pushing to place every resident within a 10-minute walk of a park by 2045, while also targeting net-zero emissions for all buildings by 2050.

Cities including New York, Seattle, Boston, and D.C. are investing in energy-efficient housing, solar incentives, and heat pumps to cut costs and emissions.

As federal climate policy stalls, mayors are leveraging local momentum to improve health, lower living costs, and stimulate regional economies through green jobs.

Key quote:

“We as elected officials have to do a better job of articulating how this important part of public policy is connected to the everyday lived experience.”

— Justin Bibb, mayor of Cleveland

Why this matters:

As federal climate initiatives recede under the Trump administration, cities are stepping up as engines of environmental action, using their nimbleness and proximity to communities to reshape daily life. Urban heat, air pollution, and unaffordable utilities hit low-income residents hardest — often compounding the health impacts of environmental injustice. By making neighborhoods greener and buildings more efficient, mayors aim to ease the cost of living while improving public health for everyone. That’s critical in cities like Cleveland, where asthma, heat vulnerability, and economic inequality collide. Local actions such as planting trees, installing solar panels, and replacing gas stoves with electric alternatives reduce emissions but also clean the air and make homes safer.

These improvements ripple outward: Urban demand for renewables drives rural solar development, while electric school buses made in Appalachian factories get kids to class without belching diesel fumes. As cities absorb the shocks of climate change and federal indifference, the choices mayors make now could shape not just local resilience, but national economic and environmental futures.

In short:

Three Texas Senate-passed bills sought to limit renewable energy by restricting wind and solar development locations, mandating one-to-one gas offsets for new renewables, and requiring backup gas generation for existing projects.

These measures, backed by far-right groups but opposed by much of the Texas business lobby, were subsequently not scheduled for House votes, effectively killing them this session.

Despite the bills’ failure, advocates warn that local opposition and political pressure may continue to threaten renewable energy expansion in Texas.

Why this matters:

Texas leads the nation in wind power and is rapidly expanding its solar footprint, yet it remains a political battleground over the future of energy. The quiet defeat of these bills reflects a growing tension within the Republican party, where local economic gains from clean energy are clashing with ideological opposition to climate-friendly policy. Rural landowners, utilities, and developers stand to gain financially from renewables, while national and state conservative groups push to protect fossil fuels. This internal rift complicates efforts to modernize the grid amid rising electricity demand and climate-related stress. The failure of these bills offers a temporary reprieve, but with organized opposition mobilizing around local discontent and future legislation already in draft form, the fight over Texas’s energy future is far from over.

Remember the banana peels, apple cores and leftover pizza you recently threw in the garbage? Today, your food waste, and your neighbors’, is emitting climate-warming greenhouse gases as it decomposes in a nearby municipal landfill.

Buried food scraps and yard waste at 51 dumps across Colorado generate an amount of methane equivalent to driving 1 million gasoline-powered cars for a year. About 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas over a period of 20 years, methane accounts for 11% of global emissions that scientists say are warming the atmosphere and contributing to more intense and severe weather, wildfires and drought.

Landfills are the third-largest source of methane pollution in Colorado, after agriculture and fossil fuel extraction. Draft methane rules released last month by the state’s Department of Public Health and Environment would, for the first time, require some dump operators to measure and quantify methane releases and to fix leaks. The proposal mandates that waste managers install a gas collection system if their dump generates a certain amount of the climate-warming gas.

It also addresses loopholes in federal law that allow waste to sit for five years before such systems are required — even though science has shown that half of all food waste decays within about three-and-a-half years. The draft rule surpasses U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards in the amount of landfill area operators must monitor for emissions. It’s set to be heard by the state’s Air Quality Control Commission in August.

Proposed regulations require the elimination of open gas flares — burning emissions directly into the atmosphere — and urge the use of biocovers and biofilters, which rely on bacteria to break down gases. The 70-page draft also calls for more routine and thorough monitoring of a dump surface with advanced technologies like satellites, which recently recorded large plumes of methane escaping from a Denver-area landfill.

“We’ve had our eyes opened thanks to technology that has made the invisible, visible — now we know the extent of the problem, which is much greater than what estimates have portrayed,” said Katherine Blauvelt, circular economy director at Industrious Labs, a nonprofit working to decarbonize industry. “When landfill operators fail to control leaks, we know harmful pollutants are coming along for the ride.”

Cancer-causing volatile organic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, escape with methane leaching from landfills. These chemicals also contribute to the formation of lung-damaging ozone pollution, an increasing problem for the 3.6 million people who live in the greater Denver metropolitan area.

Indeed, the region along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains ranked sixth in the nation for the most polluted air — with unhealthy ozone levels reported on one out of every 10 days, on average, according to the American Lung Association’s 2025 “State of the Air” report. The state is also woefully behind in its compliance with federal air quality standards.

State officials and environmental advocates agree that reducing methane emissions from landfills, which are easier to mitigate than cow burps, for example, is one of the quickest and most efficient ways to slow warming in the short term.

“Waste deposited in landfills continues producing methane for decades as it breaks down — and it’s one sector where Colorado has yet to directly take action to reduce these greenhouse gases,” said Tim Taylor, a supervisor in the state’s air pollution control division, in an online hearing last February on the proposed landfill methane rules.

Colorado’s draft regulations are similar to those in California, Oregon, Maryland and Washington, he added. More than 10 landfills in the state are already required under federal rules to have gas collection and control systems. Yet even with such technology in place, disposal facilities routinely exceed federal methane emissions caps.

The state’s health department has also identified a dozen municipal solid waste landfills, based on a preliminary analysis, that would be required to put such systems in place under the proposed rules, Zachary Aedo, an agency spokesman, said in an email to Capital & Main.

Many of these facilities are operated by counties, some of which expressed concerns about their ability to pay for such systems.

“We are a small rural county, and a multimillion-dollar containment system is going to be more than we can build,” testified Delta County Commissioner Craig Fuller at the February hearing. “The financial equation of this whole thing is absolutely mind-boggling — we are struggling as it is to provide health and human services.”

Other county officials embraced the proposed tightening of rules.

“Landfills across Colorado, including in Eagle County, are leading sources of methane pollution,” said Eagle County Commissioner Matt Scherr in a March 6 statement. “As a local elected official I support a robust rule that embraces advanced technologies to cut pollution, protect public health and help the methane mitigation industry thrive.”

For larger landfill companies, like Waste Management, which operates 283 active disposal sites nationwide, figuring out which technology works to best monitor emissions from a dump’s surface is proving a complex challenge. The company is testing technologies at facilities with different topographies and climate fluctuations to understand what causes emissions releases, said Amy Banister, Waste Management senior director of air programs.

“Landfills are complicated, emissions vary over time, and we have emissions 24/7,” said Banister at an online meeting last September of a technical group created by Colorado health department officials. “Drones produced a lot of false positives — and we need more work understanding how fixed sensors can be applied in a landfill environment.”

State health officials suggested municipalities could offset the costs of installing gas collection systems at disposal sites by converting methane into energy. Several landfill operations in Colorado currently have such waste-to-energy systems — which send power they generate to the state’s power grid.

“We are mindful of the costs of complying with this rule and how tipping fees may be impacted,” said Taylor, an air quality supervisor, at the February hearing. “Analyses conducted in other states of their landfill methane rules found there wasn’t an increase in tipping fees as a result of regulations over time.”

Tipping fees are paid by those who dispose of waste in a landfill. If operators passed on compliance costs to households, a state analysis found, the yearly average annual fee would increase $22.90 per household.

Compliance violations

Colorado’s push comes as the EPA issued an enforcement alert in September that found “recurring Clean Air Act compliance issues” at municipal solid waste landfills that led to the “significant release of methane,” based on 100 inspections conducted over three years.

Such violations included improper design and installation of gas collection and control systems, failure to maintain adequate “cover integrity” and improper monitoring of facilities for emissions.

To address gaps in federal regulations, which require operators to measure emissions four times a year by walking in a grid pattern across the face of the landfill with a handheld sensor, Colorado’s draft rules require third-party monitoring. Such measurements must be conducted offsite by an entity approved by the state’s air pollution control division that uses a satellite, aircraft or mobile monitoring platform.

The infrequency of such grid walks — which skip spots that operators deem dangerous — contributes to the undercounting of methane emissions from landfills, according to a satellite-based analysis. An international team of scientists estimated potent greenhouse gas emissions from landfills are 50% higher than EPA estimates. Satellites like one operated by nonprofit Carbon Mapper found large methane plumes outside the quarterly monitoring periods over the Tower Landfill in Commerce City, northeast of Denver.

The satellite allowed scientists to see parts of the landfill not accessible with traditional monitoring — measurements that found that such landfills are underreporting their methane emissions to state regulators, said Tia Scarpelli, a research scientist and waste sector lead at Carbon Mapper.

“Landfill emissions tend to be quite persistent — if a landfill is emitting when it’s first observed, it’s likely to be emitting later on,” she added. Scarpelli cautioned that it’s important for regulators to investigate with operators what was happening on the landfill surface at the time the leak was measured.

Tower Landfill’s operator, Allied Waste Systems of Colorado LLC, provided reasons for such large methane releases in a January 2024 report to the state’s health department, including equipment malfunctions. The fix for about 22 emissions events over the federal methane limits detected in August 2023 by surface monitoring: “Soil added as cover maintenance.”

Like many dumps across Colorado and the nation, the Tower Landfill is located near a community that’s already disproportionately impacted by emissions from industrial activities.

“These landfills are not only driving climate change, they are also driving a public health crisis in our community,” said Guadalupe Solis, director of environmental justice programs at Cultivando, a nonprofit led by Latina and Indigenous women in northern Denver. “The Tower Landfill is near nursing homes, clinics, near schools with majority Hispanic students.”

Physicians in the state warned that those who live the closest to dumps suffer the worst health effects from pollutants like benzene and hydrogen sulfide, which are linked to cancer, heart and other health conditions.

“People living near landfills, like myself, my family and my patients, experience higher exposure to air pollution,” testified Dr. Nikita Habermehl, a specialist in pediatric emergency medicine who lives near a landfill in Larimer County, at the Feb. 26 public hearing, “leading to increased rates of respiratory issues and headaches and asthma worsened by poor air quality.”

The Reilly Tar site, which operated for over a century, sits in a working-class neighborhood where residents have long lived in the shadow of chemical fumes and cancer fears.

Low-Energy Fridays: Is lightning-fast permitting possible?

Under the Trump administration’s executive order (EO) 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” the Department of the Interior (DOI) has created an “alternative arrangement” process for some energy permits that could enable a major project to receive a permit in as little as 28 days instead of the usual two to four years. But is this actually possible? And if it’s so easy, why hasn’t it been done before? The simple answer is that, while this approach may score some near-term victories, it could potentially create more problems than it solves.

Extraordinary permitting delays have been a concern for both parties for some time now. Because some projects take over a decade to be permitted, politicians seeking to get more built want to make adjustments to expedite the process. One of the main factors in these delays is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which governs compliance with environmental statutes for new infrastructure projects.

Projects do not have a “significant environmental impact” under NEPA guidelines in about 99 percent of cases, but exceptionally large—and economically noteworthy—projects almost always have a significant environmental impact. Consequently, they are required to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of their permit under NEPA, which kicks off a multi-year permitting process. Because any major infrastructure project is likely to require an EIS, the protracted timelines are often pegged as an underlying reason for delayed infrastructure development. However, in some emergency situations, an “alternative arrangement” for NEPA compliance may be used, and the DOI is arguing that President Donald J. Trump’s EO justifies utilization of this procedure. The new alternative NEPA process, which can apply to projects needing a permit under the DOI, would cut this to 28 days for most energy types, though wind and solar power are notably ineligible. An assistant secretary or equivalent (i.e., a high-level political appointee) must approve its use. What, then, is different about the new process?

At surface level, the NEPA permitting process concludes with a Record of Decision (ROD) by the government noting that a project’s environmental impact has been evaluated and that relevant statutes (like those from the Endangered Species Act or the National Historic Preservation Act) have been complied with. The DOI’s new alternative arrangement for the NEPA process specifies that these laws must still be complied with, and this is where we encounter a problem: The reason it takes so long to prepare an EIS supporting an ROD is that it takes a long time to evaluate compliance.

Additionally, the government is frequently sued over its permits for environmentally significant projects, with 72 percent of the litigation coming from non-governmental organizations potentially seeking to delay projects. This type of litigation often challenges the adequacy of EISs, and courts must decide if supplemental materials should be prepared. Research has found a correlation between EIS preparation time and litigation outcomes, where agencies that take longer to prepare EISs fare better in court— leading some to find that litigation risk drives longer permitting timelines. Importantly, research has found that litigation rarely forces any change in a project’s construction. Proponents of litigation argue that this is important oversight ensuring quality permits from government and environmental protection, while critics argue that the litigation does not improve environmental quality and is merely used as a tactic to delay infrastructure deployment.

Getting back to the alternative NEPA arrangement, it is technically legal for the government to issue an ROD within any amount of time. The government can do this, and theoretically, the emergency authorities it relies on should override many of the statutory causes of permitting delay. But can the government successfully argue in court that it fully complied with all relevant statutes and requirements in such a short time? Probably not, especially considering that the DOI’s justification for relying on emergency authorities doesn’t fit within the definitions of the statute they invoke. So why bother at all?

The entire litigation process takes 4.2 years on average. During that process, the court tells the defendant (in this case, the government) exactly how their EIS is deficient and what supplemental materials must be prepared. From the standpoint of someone who wants to get as many projects built as quickly as possible, there is a temptation to cut out the middleman and go straight to the courts. After all, if legal uncertainty is what makes NEPA documents take so long to prepare, then why not force the courts to figure it out? Some of the political calculus there makes sense.

But from a policy perspective, this may cause more headaches than benefits. It isn’t likely that courts would sustain the idea that the 28-day EIS represents sufficient compliance. Instead of detailing what the EIS should contain, they may simply reject the idea that NEPA’s alternative arrangement represents a reasonable fulfillment of the law. Recent tariff news where courts rejected the idea that the president’s emergency authority applies to non-emergency situations puts further doubt on a court victory for the DOI. Projects would take even longer to get permitted under such a scenario.

The bigger issue is that if the courts sustain this alternative arrangement, then it opens the door to all sorts of political shenanigans that would make the permitting process even more susceptible to the whims of politicians. (To a certain extent, this is a road we have already been down—arguably since the Keystone XL pipeline controversy.) The politicization of permits has worsened over time, and while those in power may see this as an opportunity to score some wins for their side, the broader economic effect is decidedly negative. If investors believe that constructing a major energy project in the United States depends upon electoral outcomes, the result will be more risk and less investment. And if that happens, we’ll probably end up with less long-run productivity and higher long-run energy costs.

Ignoring the legal uncertainty of the DOI’s alternative NEPA process for a moment, the key question is whether politicians should be responsible for choosing who can get a fast permit and who cannot. Put another way, should the government be in the business of picking winners and losers? The emphatic economic answer is no, as politicians can never be as effective as the market at steering investment. Better policy would result from Congress addressing the systemic causes of permitting delays without political preference for the types of projects permitted, but we’re not quite there yet.

Ultimately, the DOI’s new permitting policies are a product of the current political environment and congressional inaction. But if we want the sort of structural permitting reform that gets America building things again, we’re going to need less politicking on permits rather than more.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/permits.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 12:24:05.081647

Katie Surma, Georgina Gustin and Nicholas Kusnetz report for Inside Climate News.

In short:

A Boston University analysis found 68% of China’s overseas energy investments in 2022–2023 went to solar and wind, up from just 13% between 2000 and 2021.

While new coal plant financing has stopped, earlier investments continue to result in new coal power plants coming online, which could emit as much CO₂ annually as Austria.

China’s shift is partly driven by a need to export surplus renewable technology amid economic challenges and has included a recent $51 billion pledge to support low-carbon energy in Africa.

Key quote:

China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.”

— Xi Jinping, president of China

Why this matters:

The shift in China's overseas energy financing has far-reaching implications for both global carbon emissions and the geopolitics of clean energy. While Beijing's move away from coal-backed infrastructure projects aligns with climate goals, the follow-through on existing fossil fuel investments continues to embed long-term carbon pollution in developing nations. These coal projects, built decades after wealthy nations began cutting back on such infrastructure, risk locking lower-income countries into emissions-intensive economies just as the global push to decarbonize accelerates. Environmental groups remain concerned about how this dual strategy affects vulnerable regions, especially as countries in Africa and Southeast Asia weigh economic growth against environmental health.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has “de-obligated” the loan guarantee, meaning the federal government is no longer responsible for the financing.

The move comes as Sunnova is restructuring its debt and has expressed concerns about its ability to continue operations.

Sunnova stated in a regulatory filing in March 2025 that it did not plan to utilise the DoE facility, known as Project Hestia, in the foreseeable future.

The previous administration under former President Joe Biden announced a partial loan guarantee in April 2023 to support financing for 100,000 rooftop solar installations, particularly for lower-income homeowners.

Under Biden, the DoE’s Loan Programs Office aimed to accelerate clean energy sector development by providing loans to companies that found it difficult to secure private funding.

The Energy Department described Project Hestia as the largest US government commitment to solar power at that time.

However, the residential solar sector has faced challenges due to increased interest rates, which have raised the cost of financing.

Sunnova has issued $371m in bonds backed by the Project Hestia loan guarantee. These bonds are not part of the debt Sunnova is currently looking to restructure.

Project Hestia became less appealing to Sunnova because the company could offer more affordable leased systems to homeowners, capitalising on tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced by Biden.

The tax credits for loans, which were the focus of Project Hestia, are considered less beneficial.

The current administration, led by President Donald Trump, is prioritising oil and gas production and has indicated a review of DoE financing for alternative energy companies.

The future of the loans office is uncertain, with job reductions implemented by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and budget cuts proposed in the House budget bill.

Since 2009, the office has issued $35bn in loans and loan guarantees, with repayments from companies including Tesla.

However, it has faced criticism from Republicans since 2011 following a $535m loan to Solyndra, a solar company that later failed.

It is anticipated that the next-generation Hyundai hybrid system will enhance performance and fuel efficiency across various segments.","As Hyundai Group navigates the slowdown in global Electric Vehicle (EV) demand, the company has started to refocus its efforts on its existing xEV technology — the hybrid vehicle — to drive growth. Even Genesis, the group’s luxury brand, has shifted from a strategy of full electrification to include hybrid configurations in its product line-up in response to the rising popularity of such vehicles.

In 2011, Hyundai introduced its first full hybrid system, known as the “Transmission Mounted Electrical Device” (TMED), with the Sonata model in Korea. This proprietary series-hybrid system features an electric motor positioned between the engine and transmission — referred to as the P2 configuration — and utilizes a dual-clutch mechanism to manage power distribution. Additionally, this system can operate solely on electric power under certain conditions. Over the past decade, Hyundai has integrated this hybrid system into several of its models. Sales of its Full Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FHEVs) surged from over 222k units in 2020 to more than 770k units in 2024, with an average growth rate of 36% and accounting for approximately 14% of its global Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales.

However, Hyundai’s hybrid system began to lag in fuel economy and driving performance compared to the latest models from competitors. As a result, in April 2025, the group unveiled its new Full Hybrid powertrain, known as TMED-II, which will debut in the latest Hyundai Palisade. The enhanced hybrid system not only retains the P2 motor at the transmission input but also integrates an additional motor at the engine output, known as the P1 configuration. The group claims that this innovation significantly improves fuel economy over the previous generation. Furthermore, Hyundai plans to incorporate the new hybrid system into three vehicle categories: Large, Midsize, and Compact. The same system architecture is also set to be implemented in the longitudinal powertrains of Genesis models.

It is anticipated that the next-generation Hyundai hybrid system will enhance performance and fuel efficiency across various segments. The group asserts that this new hybrid system offers a 45% improvement in fuel economy and a 29% increase in power compared to Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) of the same category.

We expect increased FHEV market penetration in the B and E segments, particularly in the B segment within emerging markets like India, where FHEVs are likely to replace diesel vehicles. Meanwhile, growth in the E segment is expected to be driven by Large SUVs from the Hyundai and Kia brands, as well as Genesis models. By 2030, our projections indicate that the group will expand its FHEV presence to approximately 1.3 mn units worldwide, representing over 21% of its global sales.

However, as global demand for EVs rises due to technological advancements and stricter emission regulations, the growth of FHEVs is expected to slow in the latter part of the decade and eventually be surpassed by pure EVs. Nevertheless, FHEVs will continue to play a crucial role in the group’s strategy to achieve its goal of full electrification.

As public transport operators and cities face increasing pressure to decarbonize fleets, charging infrastructure remains one of the most complex barriers to large-scale electric vehicle deployment. In this interview, Charlie Levine, Head of Global Strategy at Electreon, outlines how the company’s wireless charging technology offers a flexible, hands-free solution—both at rest and in motion.

From embedded coils in roadways to automated depot charging pads, Electreon’s system supports continuous vehicle operation without the need for oversized batteries or extensive grid upgrades. Levine discusses the benefits of “opportunity charging,” the operational lessons learned from large-scale deployments such as the Electra Afikim depot in Israel, and how wireless charging is being integrated into Bus Rapid Transit systems and mixed-use urban fleets around the world.

She also touches on OEM partnerships, grid optimization, and the role wireless charging could play in enabling future autonomous transit networks.

Charlie Levin, Electreon’s goal? “Removing charging as a barrier”

For those just discovering Electreon — what’s the company’s story, and how does your wireless charging work both in motion and at rest?

Electreon was founded with a clear mission: to accelerate the shift to electric mobility by removing charging as a barrier—starting with eliminating cables. Our wireless technology, embedded in roads or installed at key points, allows all types of EVs—including buses—to charge while driving, stopping, or parked at the depot.

Using electromagnetic induction, coils beneath the road transfer energy to receivers on the vehicle. It’s hands-free, invisible, and vehicle-agnostic—ideal for urban areas, depots, and varied parking layouts. The modular system reduces both upfront and long-term costs and supports today’s fleets and future autonomous vehicles.

Your team often mentions “Opportunity charging.” Why is that idea so central to your approach?

“Opportunity Charging” is our approach to smarter, more flexible charging. Instead of relying only on long overnight depot sessions, Electreon’s system delivers small energy top-ups throughout the day—during stops, passenger loading, or even a quick lunch break. This enables continuous operation without disrupting schedules.

By spreading energy use across the day, the system reduces strain on the grid—especially during peak hours—and gives operators full flexibility over when, how much, and how long to charge.

This model also promotes battery health by avoiding deep discharges and fast charging, helping extend battery life and reduce the need for oversized packs. Most importantly, it eliminates range anxiety—ensuring buses always have enough energy to complete their routes without needing backup vehicles. With wireless charging available throughout the day, operations become more predictable, cost-effective, and comparable to traditional ICE fleets.

The value of wireless charging in public transport

Where does wireless charging offer the most value in public transit—BRTs, city buses, or depots?

For BRT systems, our in-motion charging turns each station into a charging point—enabling fleet growth without the need for additional infrastructure. It eliminates mid-day downtime and supports smaller, lighter batteries, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

City buses benefit from stationary wireless charging at high-frequency stops or layovers where plug-in options aren’t practical.

At depots, embedded wireless charging creates a fully automated experience—no cables, no human handling, no scheduling. Ideal for dense depots or mixed fleets, with low-power, distributed grid connections that avoid major electrical upgrades.

The system is modular and scalable—each charging point works independently, offering built-in redundancy and future-ready flexibility for growing electric fleets.

Let’s talk about the Electra Afikim bus depot project in Israel. What lessons came from running wireless charging across a full electric bus fleet?

That project demonstrated what wireless charging can deliver at scale. Electreon’s system, deployed across eight Management Units and supporting up to 32 buses, achieved 99% operational uptime, over 90% energy transfer efficiency, and 92% of buses starting the day with more than 90% charge.

Daytime charging added 4 MWh/month—enabling 100 extra operational hours and cutting standby bus use to near zero. Peak overnight demand was reduced by 48%, slashing infrastructure and energy costs.

With real-time monitoring and a fully hands-free setup, operators gain full control—no cables, no reliance on drivers. The system is now expanding to the Ovnat Terminal, raising daytime wireless charging to 12%, adding 12,000 km per month, improving grid balance, and enabling reliable, scalable EV operations.

Charlie Levin: the benefits of an invisible system…

Cities often face space, grid, or range challenges when electrifying bus fleets. How does Electreon help overcome them?

Our system is purpose-built to solve these challenges. Firstly, it’s nearly invisible: no bulky hardware or above-ground units, just flush-mounted coils that preserve street space. This makes it ideal for curbside, terminal, and depot integration in dense cities.

Secondly, because the system spreads energy demand across multiple low-power points, it avoids peak loads and simplifies the required grid connection and configuration. This is especially helpful where grid capacity is limited or expensive to upgrade.

And finally, range becomes a non-issue. Buses charge while in operation, which means they don’t need to carry oversized batteries. That reduces vehicle weight and cost and increases route flexibility.

BRT systems are gaining traction as efficient, high-capacity solutions for urban mobility. How can Electreon’s wireless charging technology support their deployment and long-term scalability?

BRT systems are a perfect fit for dynamic wireless charging. Their fixed, predictable routes allow cities to embed charging coils at key points—supporting high-frequency service without disrupting operations.

In Trondheim, Norway, Electreon is proving how this model enables continuous service, even in harsh conditions like freezing winters and hilly terrain. These environments increase energy consumption and strain conventional charging systems. By placing wireless charging at strategic locations along the route, buses get energy where and when they need it—without leaving the route or extending layovers.

This approach also reduces reliance on high-power depot infrastructure. Distributed, low-power charging along the route makes the system modular, tamper-proof, and space-efficient—while cutting costs across batteries, infrastructure, and energy. Plus, it’s built for future autonomous fleets.

Electreon: moving from demo to commercial deployment

From Detroit to Tel Aviv to Norway—where is Electreon gaining the most traction, and what’s driving it?

We’re seeing traction in regions that combine political will with a practical need to solve electrification challenges. In the U.S., projects like Michigan Central Station are focused on innovation and public-private collaboration. In Israel, it’s about optimizing operations in dense cities. And in Norway, sustainability goals are tightly aligned with technology pilots that scale quickly.

What’s driving momentum is the ability to move from demonstration to commercial deployment. Cities and transit agencies aren’t just looking for future-proof tech—they want tech that works now and integrates with existing systems. Wireless charging, when done right, ticks those boxes.

What role do automakers play in wireless charging—and how is Electreon partnering with OEMs?

OEM collaboration is key. We work with manufacturers and integrators to equip vehicles with Electreon receivers—either in-factory or through retrofits. For example, our partnership with Toyota is focused on scaling production and reducing installation complexity.

Because our system is vehicle-agnostic, we’re able to support a wide range of fleets, from buses to last-mile vans. We’re also working with suppliers to standardize integration for easier adoption across the industry.

What might a fully wireless-powered bus network look like five or ten years from now?

In the near future, wireless charging will be a backbone of smart transit systems. Imagine a city where electric buses never stop to charge. Instead, they gain energy passively throughout the day—reducing downtime, eliminating range anxiety, and lowering grid stress.

Battery sizes will shrink, vehicle weight and cost will drop, and autonomous fleets will become viable—no cables, no manual tasks, no errors. For operators, it’s less maintenance and greater efficiency. For cities, it’s cleaner air, more reliable service, and future-ready infrastructure.

Most importantly, this is a one-time investment. Install the wireless infrastructure once, and it will support both today’s e-fleets and the autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.

Where can people see your technology in action today?

Daimler says RIZON “represents its dedication to zero-emission transportation.” (Not an absolute dedication, it seems—the US House of Representatives recently voted to kill the Biden Administration’s Clean Truck Rules, following extensive lobbying by Daimler, Volvo and other truck manufacturers.)

RIZON’s Class 4-5 medium-duty EVs will range from 15,995 to 18,850 pounds in gross vehicle weight (GVW) for Canadian customers, and offer several battery pack options. The M-size variant, with two battery packs, offers a range of up to 177 km, and the L-size variant, with three packs, delivers up to 257 km. The trucks support both Level 2 AC charging and CCS1 DC fast charging.

RIZON trucks qualify for the Canadian government’s Incentives for Medium- and Heavy-Duty-Zero-Emission-Vehicles (iMHZEV) program. A RIZON truck may qualify for up to $75,000 at the point of sale under this program. RIZON trucks may also qualify for additional provincial incentives of up to $75,000 in British Columbia.

RIZON trucks are distributed in Canada exclusively by RIZON Truck Canada, a subsidiary of Velocity Vehicle Group. RIZON’s current network of dealers in Canada includes nine locations across British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/no-plate-HQ-dump-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 12:24:47.221516

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives.","As of February, Forsyth County has 2,947 registered electric vehicles (EVs) and Guilford County has 4,745, marking year-over-year increases of about 42% and 45%, respectively.

According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), the number of registered EVs in Forsyth and Guilford counties rose from 442 and 799 in February 2020 to 927 and 1,454 in 2022, and further to 2,075 and 3,262 in February 2024.

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Timothy Johnson, professor of the Practice of Energy and the Environment at Duke University, noted that while both counties’ growth rates appear impressive, they still represent an “increase from a relatively small number,” a trend seen across much of the country, except in states like California, where demand is significantly higher.

“You've seen a much greater market share of EVs in other countries — Denmark, and some of the other Nordic countries, as well as China, are going gangbusters on electric vehicles. We're just not seeing that in the U.S.”

In a survey published by EY last year, only 34% of U.S. consumers intending to buy a new vehicle in the next 24 months planned to purchase an EV, marking a 14% decrease from 48% in 2023. A lack of charging stations, limited driving range, battery life and expensive maintenance fees were among the key factors contributing to this decline, as cited by the survey.

How EVs help cut carbon

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has aligned with the president’s pro-coal stance, often promoting his “Drill, baby, drill” slogan and praising Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s calls to keep coal plants active in the country in its social media posts.

Nonetheless, the department’s website emphasizes a different message, stating that using hybrid vehicles and EVs “supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet.”

“The multiple fuel sources used to generate electricity result in a more secure energy source for the electrified portion of the transportation sector,” it adds.

In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper set a statewide goal of reaching 1.25 million registered zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 under Executive Order 246. His earlier goal of reaching 80,000 registered EVs by 2025, outlined in Executive Order 80, was surpassed in November 2023, which Gov. Josh Stein praised the achievement then as a reflection of the state’s commitment to the EV sector.

“Most EVs will automatically reduce life-cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 50% from their gasoline powered counterparts,” said Noah Kittner, an assistant professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The U.S. Department of Energy states that a small electric SUV produces 52% fewer life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline vehicle.

The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States, and greenhouse gases are the key contributors to climate change, driving rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, which impact both the environment and public health, as noted by researchers and scientists around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The biggest environmental benefits of electric vehicles have to do with air quality and pollutant emissions…shifting from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles moves the emissions to power plants, which are far fewer in number, and since they don't move around, they're easier to control,” Johnson said.

Why EVs make economic sense — but policy still lags

Mark Curtis, associate professor and Reynolds Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, explained that EVs are “simply better products than internal combustion cars” from an economic standpoint.

“They are cheaper to own over the life of the car, they require less maintenance, and they perform better,” Curtis said. “They accelerate faster, have fewer parts, and don’t need oil changes or regular engine repairs. For most drivers, especially those who can charge at home, they are already the better option.”

According to a 2020 analysis by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Idaho National Laboratory (INL), drivers can save up to $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years by choosing an electric vehicle instead of a similar gasoline-powered one.

Gas-powered cars, Curtis added, create significant economic costs by negatively impacting people's health and reducing their productivity.

“Yet under current rules, those damages are not priced into the cost of driving,” Curtis said.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives. Instead, Duke Energy offers a one-time rebate of up to $1,133 to help households prepare for at-home EV charging, which Curtis noted as “particularly relevant” in Winston-Salem and Greensboro, where many residents live in single-family homes.

“It’s worth noting that utilities have an interest in encouraging EV charging at certain times because it could actually save the utilities money in terms of grid operational costs and distribution system upgrades,” Kittner said.

Kittner expressed skepticism, however, about North Carolina adopting incentives or rebates, pointing out the recent decision by the N.C. General Assembly to raise the annual registration fee for fully electric vehicles from $140 to $180.

“Recent policies suggest that there may be additional fees levied on EV owners,” he added. “So it seems the current proposals are increasing costs of adoption rather than providing new rebates or incentives.”

CLEAN FUEL PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Z) The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.","On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed its reconciliation bill, H.R. 1, entitled “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the “legislation”), which significantly amends the clean energy provisions that were enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). Now the revised legislation advances to the Senate, where it is likely to be amended before both chambers reconcile their differences and finalize the legislation for the President’s approval or veto. Although the legislation is not final and could change before final enactment, its impact on the clean energy provisions enacted as part of the IRA warrants attention from investors, developers, manufacturers, and financiers that rely on these provisions. The legislation imposes a number of significant changes to the IRA, including the elimination of the investment tax credit and production tax credit under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively, for any facilities that are not under construction prior to the date that is 60 days after enactment and a full repeal of the EV credits. Below is a summary of key provisions in the legislation most likely to affect energy and manufacturing transactions.

PHASE-OUTS AND TERMINATIONS OF ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING CREDITS

Under the legislation, several energy-related credits are phased out or terminated. The legislation accelerates the sunset of numerous credits which, under current law, run well into the 2030s or have no fixed end date.

1. CLEAN ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Y) AND CLEAN ELECTRICITY INVESTMENT CREDIT (SECTION 48E)

The clean electricity production tax credit (the “PTC”) and the clean electricity investment tax credit (“ITC”) are very important components of the IRA. These two tech-neutral credits apply to investments in qualifying clean electricity generation or storage property. The PTC and ITC took effect at the beginning of 2025 and are available to all new zero-emission electricity production facilities. Under current law, the PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032, or when the US power sector reaches 25 percent of 2022 emissions levels, whichever is later.

The legislation significantly accelerates the elimination of these credits. The ITC and PTC are repealed for projects beginning construction more than 60 days after enactment of the legislation. Additionally, in order to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2028. This is a significant departure from prior repeals and sunsets of the credits, in which Congress solely used a “beginning of construction” standard as a transition rule. The two-pronged transition rule under the legislation means that developers will be required to quickly incur 5% of a project’s cost or begin physical work of a significant nature, but doing so will not grandfather the qualification of a project that fails to be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028. Additionally, the legislation specifically eliminates the credit for residential wind and solar leasing arrangements beginning on the day the legislation is enacted.

The effective date of the FEOC restrictions would vary depending on the specific FEOC restriction, as follows: (i) for taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity,” effective immediately for tax years beginning after enactment; (ii) for projects the construction of which includes any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” effective for facilities beginning construction after one year from enactment; and (iii) for taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity,” effective in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

In addition, 100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a “specified taxpayer” makes an “applicable payment” within ten years after the property is placed in service. This is longer than the typical five-year recapture period and does not include a step-down during the recapture period.

2. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45X)

The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit provides a credit for domestic production of key clean energy components like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals. Under the legislation, a phased reduction of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit begins in 2029. Production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify, one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027, and the general phase-out mirrors the 45Y/48E schedule. Under current law, full credit is available through 2029 with a softer ramp-down (75% in 2030, 50 % in 2031, 25% in 2032, and zero thereafter). Similar to 45X, the nuclear production tax credit (45U) ends on December 31, 2031, one year earlier than current law.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers that are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment, taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity” with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning two years after enactment, and eligible components produced in tax years beginning two years after enactment that (i) include any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreement with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

3. CLEAN FUEL PRODUCTION CREDIT (SECTION 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Under current law, the credit is available for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2028. The legislation extends the Clean Fuel Production Credit to make credits available for fuels sold through December 31, 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment and taxpayers who are a “foreign-influenced entity” in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

FOREIGN ENTITY OF CONCERN LIMITATION

The legislation significantly expands the existing concept of a foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) found in other parts of the Code by introducing new criteria and definitions of a “prohibited foreign entity,” a “specified foreign entity,” and a “foreign-influenced entity.” Under the legislation, eligibility for the credits under Sections 45, 45Y, 48, 48E, or 45X (further discussed below) may be denied where a “prohibited foreign entity” is involved in certain aspects of the facility’s development or ownership (typically requiring meaningful connections to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran). The complexity of these rules will require careful planning to ensure compliance and no inadvertent foot fault.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: a broad category established in the legislation encompassing both “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

Specified Foreign Entity: any foreign entity of concern as defined in section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, entities identified as Chinese military companies operating in the United States, entities included on certain federal government lists, certain battery-producing entities, and any foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign Controlled Entity: an entity owned or controlled by the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), citizens or residents of such a nation (excluding US citizens or lawful permanent residents), entities organized under the laws of a covered nation, or entities controlled by any of the foregoing, an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity.

Foreign Influenced Entity: an entity will be classified as a “foreign-influenced entity” if:

During the taxable year, (i) a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; (iii) specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or (iv) one or more specified foreign entities collectively hold at least 25% of the entity’s debt.

In addition, an entity will also be deemed foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly makes, or had reason to know it made, payments of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amounts (each, an “applicable payment”) either: (i) in an amount equal to or exceeding 10% of the total of such payments to any single specified foreign entity, or (ii) in an aggregate amount equal to or exceeding 25% of the total of such payments to multiple specified foreign entities.

While “specified foreign entity” and “foreign controlled entity” are not new concepts (although, as discussed below, the legislation would expand their applicability to more credits), the “foreign influenced entity” is a new category of FEOC. Presumably, these expansions are designed to capture both direct and indirect foreign influence or control, particularly from countries or organizations deemed adversarial or high risk, and serve as the basis for restricting access to certain federal tax benefits.

As discussed in more detail below, under the legislation, a taxpayer classified as a specified foreign entity would be ineligible to claim any credit for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. For taxpayers falling into certain less restrictive categories—such as foreign-influenced entities or those making payments to prohibited foreign entities—the legislation would generally bar eligibility for credits starting two years after the date of enactment.

The legislation applies the constructive ownership rules under Section 318, excluding Section 318(a)(3) related to partnerships, to determine whether an entity qualifies as a “prohibited foreign entity.” This exclusion of partnership attribution rules may prevent the application of Section 318 in the context of partnerships, narrowing the scope of entities deemed prohibited foreign entities through partnership relationships. However, the application of the remaining Section 318 rules could still pose significant challenges when assessing whether a US entity is treated as a prohibited foreign entity under the proposed FEOC restrictions. This raises compliance and structuring concerns, particularly for multinational holding company structures, and may call for a clarification or exception to avoid unintentionally sweeping US companies into the prohibited foreign entity definition solely through constructive ownership.

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE FROM AN FEOC

A broad restriction applies to any project that receives “material assistance” from an FEOC during construction. This is a new restriction that did not exist under the IRA. A facility is deemed to have received material assistance if:

It includes any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined under Section 45X(c)(6)) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity; or

Its design relies on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or know-how provided by such an entity.

However, the bill carves out a limited exception for assembly parts or “constituent materials” that are not uniquely designed or formulated for use in qualified facilities or eligible components under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X and are not predominantly produced, processed, or extracted by prohibited foreign entities. Although this exception is potentially helpful to the industry, the breadth of this exception may depend, in part, on how broadly “uniquely designed or formulated” is defined in subsequent guidance.

As discussed below, this “material assistance” restriction would generally bar eligibility for credits starting one or two years after the date of enactment, depending on the specific credit.

TRANSFERABILITY OF CERTAIN CLEAN ENERGY CREDITS REPEALED FOR FUTURE YEARS

The IRA permits most clean-energy credits to be sold by taxpayers, which has created a robust secondary market that has allowed sponsors with limited or no tax capacity to efficiently monetize these credits directly to raise capital. The legislation would unwind this regime for some forms of tax credits. The affected credits are those generated under Sections 45Q and Section 48(a)(3)(vii) (i.e., geothermal heat pump systems). The legislation would repeal transferability for projects that “begin construction” two years after the date that the legislation is enacted, which could be as early as July and most likely by August 2025. Accordingly, we expect the familiar “beginning of construction” rules (i.e., 5% safe harbor and physical work test) will apply to grandfather 45Q and geothermal projects that begin construction during the two-year window. Project developers should consider entering into beginning-of-construction arrangements, particularly the 5% safe harbor which is not project specific, to preserve the option of transferability, keeping in mind that a project generally must be placed in service within four years of the date upon which it began construction.

For Sections 45Z and 45X, transferability of credits is terminated after December 31, 2027, for electricity generated or fuels or components made after that date. The legislation does not retroactively disturb transfers executed for 2023-2025 credits, and market participants can still transact in credits generated before the repeal dates.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16300_1146.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 07:00:17.547246

This partnership will position our manufacturers to lead in the clean energy future, keeping production local and ensure that Michigan remains a hub of innovation and industry. Let’s keep working hard to make a difference and build a Michigan where everyone can thrive.”

“We know we can keep Michigan as a leader in manufacturing, while also strengthening the prosperity of everyone in our state,” said Community & Worker Economic Transition Office Director Jonathan Smith. ""Through innovative partnerships like this one between government, industry, nonprofit organizations and philanthropy we can deliver powerful lasting, impactful solutions that help our businesses, workers and communities plan for and thrive in the future.""

The State of Michigan will work closely with DTE and Consumers Energy to identify in-state suppliers, help them retool to meet the energy sector’s needs and connect them with the resources necessary to grow and compete. The partnership will reduce long lead times for critical equipment and components that currently have few or zero domestic suppliers. Having more local suppliers also means keeping prices affordable for Michigan ratepayers.

“DTE has a long history of partnering with Michigan businesses to keep our spending local, and we’re proud to build on that history by committing to spend $2 billion annually with Michigan suppliers,” said Trevor Lauer, vice chairman and group president, DTE Energy. “Focusing on keeping our spending in-state has a transformative impact on the Michigan economy, allowing businesses to grow and creating thousands of jobs, while also helping DTE to build an agile supply chain that allows us to deliver the services our customers demand and deserve.”

The partnership will also help utilities more quickly and efficiently meet their reliability and resiliency goals, putting Michigan on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“We'd love to see Michigan’s manufacturing talent and expertise build the energy equipment we need right here at home,” said Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. “Cultivating and buying from a resilient, robust energy supply chain in Michigan continues Consumers Energy’s longstanding commitment to in-state suppliers. It’s the natural next step, and the right thing for Consumers Energy, our customers and the state.”

To help manufacturers and clean energy startups retool their facilities and retain their workers to support new work coming in from utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy, the Transition Office is also launching the MI Hub for Manufacturers. With $1.5 million in support from philanthropy and a partnership with Next Street, a national small business and supplier solutions company, this dynamic, interactive online platform will connect small and mid-sized manufactures to public, private and non-profit resources. The platform will publish funding opportunities, connect businesses to expert advisors and capital products, provide on-demand digital learning tools and host partner resources that can help suppliers diversify and grow to enter new supply chains.

“We are proud to partner with the State of Michigan to equip manufacturers with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive, grow, and lead in an evolving industrial landscape,” said CEO of Next Street, Charisse Conanan Johnson. “The MI Hub for Manufacturers is a powerful example of public-private partnership—bringing together government, philanthropy, industry, and community organizations to deliver real value to small and mid-sized businesses. Equitable economic growth starts by unlocking the full potential of our local supply chains, and Michigan is setting the standard for what that looks like.”

“The Community and Worker Economic Transition Office will help ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy,” Glenn Stevens Jr., Executive Director, MichAuto at the Detroit Regional Chamber. “This work resonates strongly with MichAuto's mission to ensure the state's signature automotive and mobility industry, Michigan, and its workers continue to lead the world in automotive manufacturing and innovation well into the future.”

The Community & Worker Economic Transition Office was created as part of a historic package of clean energy and climate bills passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Whitmer in 2023. The office will ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy.

However, if Congress cuts federal energy investments and tax credits, projects like these will immediately become less feasible and Michiganians will lose out.
Research shows that ratepayers will see energy bills go up if these federal tax credits and incentives disappear.
We need to create more good-paying union jobs that deliver reliable energy and preserve federal investments that make that possible.
Lawmakers ought to protect our future and open doors for working people by protecting federal energy incentives.","Right now, thousands of jobs are at stake in Michigan if Congress passes the House’s budget proposal, gutting clean energy tax credits. I know firsthand how devastating that would be for working families. When Palisades Nuclear Generating Station shut down in 2022, working families in southwest Michigan took a major hit. We lost a huge economic engine and hundreds of jobs, uprooting many local families and forcing folks into unemployment. Now, thanks to federal energy incentives and state funding, Palisades is coming back online and bringing hundreds of good union jobs that will provide family-supporting wages, benefits and opportunities for the next generation. Plus, this plant alone will produce 800 megawatts of homegrown electricity, enough to power 800,000 homes. As energy demand and electricity bills rise, we need this power now more than ever.

Before I was a business manager for International Brotherhood of Electricians (IBEW) Local 131, I was a journeyman electrician. In the 1990s, I worked on several projects at Palisades, including a project with about one hundred of my fellow union brothers and sisters to rebuild containment structures and steam generators. The return of the Palisades facility will give a new generation of Michiganians these same opportunities I benefited from. That’s only possible because of federal investments. These incentives are going to support upwards of 1,000 high-quality jobs created across more than a dozen unions for the modernization, maintenance and operation of this plant. These jobs will have family-supporting wages, healthcare, retirement security, rigorous safety standards and provide a collective voice on the job. Money that local workers earn is then put back into our local economy supporting our public schools and small businesses.

The re-opening of the Palisades plant will be a game-changer for many Michigan families and Palisades is only the tip of the iceberg: there are thousands more clean energy projects made possible by federal energy investments across the country. In Michigan alone, there are 108 utility-scale solar, wind and battery storage projects that could be eligible for federal energy tax credits, representing more than 29,000 jobs, $22 billion in investment, and nearly 14,000 megawatts of power generation and storage.

Right now, hundreds of union workers are constructing the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, and once this plant is completed by the end of the year, it’ll employ hundreds more to manufacture electric batteries. This small town has less than 7,000 people, but with this influx of approximately 1,700 jobs, the town and local area are going to be revived and invigorated. Water treatment, power lines, utilities and roads have all improved as a result of this clean energy project. Local job training opportunities through Michigan Works! ensure that people succeed for years to come in union careers. Quite simply, everything is improving in Marshall because of this project.

However, if Congress cuts federal energy investments and tax credits, projects like these will immediately become less feasible and Michiganians will lose out. Research shows that ratepayers will see energy bills go up if these federal tax credits and incentives disappear. If we want to protect jobs, protect ratepayers and build a strong energy independent future in Michigan, it’s imperative our representatives act to keep these incentives intact.

Michigan families feel the crunch of inflation and rising energy bills every day. We need to create more good-paying union jobs that deliver reliable energy and preserve federal investments that make that possible. Lawmakers ought to protect our future and open doors for working people by protecting federal energy incentives.

The Supreme Court is considering the wide use of universal injunctions in a separate case that will be handed down in the coming weeks.","The Supreme Court on Thursday limited the authority of judges to block infrastructure projects due to environmental concerns.

The justices handed down the lone decision Thursday morning, slightly curbing judicial authority at a time when President Donald Trump's administration is loudly complaining about alleged judicial overreach. The case, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, relates to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the requirement for environmental impact statements (EIS) in infrastructure projects supported by the federal government.

""NEPA does not allow courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the opinion of the court.

""Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness,"" the opinion continued.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW EL SALVADOR DEPORTATION FLIGHT CASE

Kavanaugh went on to state that agencies should not be expected to consider the environmental impact of any project aside from the one they are currently working on, ""even if"" the environmental impacts ""might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or materialize later in time.""

""The fact that the project might foreseeably lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project does not mean the agency must consider that separate project’s environmental effects,"" the court ruled.

Thursday's decision was an 8-0 ruling, with Justice Neil Gorsuch taking no part in the consideration of the case. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett joined with Kavanaugh's opinion.

FEDERAL COURT UPENDS DECADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Meanwhile, Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate concurring opinion, onto which joined Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The justice’s decision is based on a project in Utah in which the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition (SCIC) petitioned the Surface Transportation Board (STB) – which is a federal agency – to build an 88-mile railway to transport crude oil from Utah’s Uinta Basin to a national railway.

When the STZB released an EIS on the railway, opponents of the project in Eagle County, Colorado, argued the federal agency did not consider all the project’s environmental effects, which opponents claimed violated NEPA.

The case was presented to a D.C. Circuit Court, which ultimately ruled STB violated environmental law and that a new, more thorough review be conducted in order for the project to move forward. SCIC petitioned SCOTUS in the case in March 2024.

US SUPREME COURT HALTS EPA'S ‘GOOD NEIGHBOR’ RULE ON DOWNWIND POLLUTION

Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said she is ""deeply concerned"" about how the decision could hamper environmental justice and allow oil and gas companies to exploit public lands.

""This decision lays the groundwork for an environmental catastrophe,"" DeGette said. ""As the harsh impacts of the climate crisis increase the vulnerability of the Colorado River, the risk of an oil spill along this train route is unacceptable.

""Increasing fracking levels and transporting them across the country would not only harm the communities through which the train travels, including those in Denver, but it would further devastate the communities surrounding the facilities where this oil would burn.""

Trump, having a history in major construction projects, has repeatedly complained about environmental impact statements and the roadblocks they can cause.

NUMBER OF INJUNCTIONS HALTING TRUMP POLICIES TROUNCES PREDECESSORS BY DOUBLE

Republicans have also widely criticized what they see as judicial overreach in federal judges unilaterally blocking major aspects of Trump's agenda.

""Universal injunctions are an unconstitutional abuse of judicial power,"" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital earlier this month.

“It’s a scientific policy issue that should be decided by the political branches: the executive branch and Congress,” Chevron attorney Ted Boutrous told South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Roger Young in a hearing. “A string of cases from state courts and federal courts require dismissal.”

The office of South Carolina’s attorney general agrees.

“The state agrees entirely with the defense position here that their motion to dismiss should be granted entirely on the merits,” Ben McGray, assistant deputy solicitor with the South Carolina attorney general’s office, told the judge Thursday.

The U.S. Constitution prohibits one state from dictating or regulating conduct in another state, Gray said.

“Allowing the plantiffs’ claims to go forward, would this violate the equal dignity that is afforded each state in the union,” Gray said. “That’s inherent in our federal system.”

In the lawsuit filed in 2020, Charleston claimed the companies contributed to greenhouse gas pollution, global warming, and climate change by selling fossil fuel products.

In the lawsuit, Charleston seeks unspecified monetary damages from the oil and gas companies.

Attorneys for Charleston argued Thursday that the oil and gas companies knew that their products contributed to climate change but kept that from the public.

Vic Sher, one of Charleston’s attorneys, compared the Charleston climate change case to tobacco, opioid lawsuits and asbestos lawsuits.

Sher said as a result of climate change, Charleston will have to spend billions of dollars to construct sea walls and other mitigation measures. The lawsuit does not seek to dictate how other states handle climate change.

“It is about the money,” the attorney told the judge. “The complaint states that the purpose of the lawsuit is to transfer money from those who benefit from the misconduct – the wrongful promotion and marketing and the failures to warn – to the taxpayers who would otherwise have to bear that burden.”

Boutrous countered that Charleston is asking the oil and gas companies to pay for alleged climate change damage that “overwhelmingly occurred in other states, other countries.”

An estimated 87% of global carbon emissions are generated outside of the United States, he told the judge.

“Only .17% of greenhouse gas emissions originate in South Carolina,” he said.

The hearing is scheduled to resume Friday.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/floydct.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f62f46f0-a821-11e6-8414-d3c39780621c.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-05-30 07:01:18.495497

The proposed IRA changes could endanger nearly 300 solar and energy storage facilities in the US, threatening 300,000 jobs and 145TWh of clean energy capacity. 80% of these facilities lie in Republican-voting states, and restrictive “foreign entity” clauses could cut off vital global supply chains and disrupt US leadership in AI and energy.

Discover how these changes impact your sourcing strategies.

Why Are IRA Changes a Threat to US Solar Manufacturing?

Recent proposals in the US Congress suggest modifying the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), potentially cutting vital tax credits for solar and energy storage manufacturing. This threatens the operational stability of almost 300 facilities, jeopardizing 300,000 jobs and disrupting the renewable energy supply chain. A crucial factor is the introduction of “foreign entity of concern” rules, targeting Chinese suppliers. Many US facilities depend on global partners like VFD manufacturers in China, making the potential policy change a serious threat to supply continuity. These changes could also increase costs for VFD suppliers and disrupt planned capacity expansion.

How Will This Affect Solar Energy Generation and Pricing?

If the new IRA provisions pass, the US could lose 145TWh of solar energy generation capacity. This would directly impact electricity pricing, potentially causing significant hikes for consumers and businesses alike. Solar PV and energy storage technologies currently represent 84% of new capacity in 2024. The anticipated rise in demand due to AI and data centers could face major setbacks. VFD suppliers are essential to stabilizing renewable energy systems, and policy changes disrupting the solar sector could cascade into delays and shortages in essential electrical equipment globally.

What Does This Mean for US Tech and AI Growth?

The US energy shortfall resulting from IRA changes could cripple AI and data center expansion. Renewable energy, especially solar PV, is the fastest-growing and most cost-effective energy source. If US energy infrastructure fails to meet the expected AI-driven demand surge, it could result in widespread blackouts and cede technological leadership to competitors like China. VFD manufacturers in China and industrial inverter partners can provide critical technology support to mitigate these risks, offering scalable solutions to maintain stable power supplies for emerging tech applications.

How Can Global Suppliers Secure Their Position Amid Changes?

For global VFD manufacturers and VFD suppliers, the proposed IRA changes present both challenges and opportunities. With restrictions targeting “foreign entities of concern,” companies need to diversify supply chains and reinforce compliance with new regulations. One effective strategy is partnering with local US businesses or establishing regional manufacturing or assembly facilities. USFULL, a trusted VFD supplier, is well-positioned to offer flexible solutions, including product customization, local compliance support, and seamless logistics management. This positions global suppliers as indispensable partners, ensuring stability despite regulatory changes.

About Sol Systems Sol Systems is an impact-driven Independent Power Producer (IPP) committed to building, owning, and managing clean energy infrastructure that benefits local communities.","Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today (May 29) for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA's Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company's broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)'s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

""This project is a testament to what's possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,"" said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. ""From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we're proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.""

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL's manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA's largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company's ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

""We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we're taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. ""We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.""

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project's final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA's own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an ""energy community,"" designated due to the area's unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

""From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,"" said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. ""The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.""

Now, many of those efforts are at risk of disappearing.

Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency abruptly ended a Biden-era program that funded environmental justice efforts across the country. In the Mountains and Plains region alone, including Colorado, Utah and four other states, nearly $50 million was lost.

Among the casualties: at least two Boulder-based groups that lost nearly all their funding, and a third that was preparing to launch a new program.

FLOWS (Foundations for Leaders Organizing for Water and Sustainability) lost a $250,000 federal grant, all of its funding for 2026 and more than half for 2025.

“For a grassroots group like ours, this is a significant cut to our budget,” said Michelle Gabrieloff-Parish, FLOWS’ founder. “A $250,000 grant is so little compared to federal spending, but it’s so much for a community-based group like ours.”

The eliminated funding came from the EPA’s regional grant hubs under the Justice40 Initiative, Biden’s effort to direct 40% of federal climate investments to communities historically burdened by pollution and extreme weather disasters.

On May 2, the agency announced it was cutting the regional grants hubs, stating they were no longer aligned with its funding priorities. Days later, the hubs shut down, staff were laid off and millions in promised grants to hundreds of organizations vanished.

In Boulder County, the impact was swift and wide-ranging:

FLOWS lost $250,000, all its funding for 2026 and over half for 2025. Founded over a decade ago, it’s considered Boulder’s longest-running environmental justice group.

The Boulder County Climate Justice Collaborative lost $150,000, more than 90% of its budget, intended to support community advocacy around coal ash contamination at the Valmont Power Station.

Community-Led Preparedness Training, a disaster preparedness program sponsored by the city and others, was expecting a second-round EPA grant but now has no funding to train frontline communities for climate-related disasters like the Marshall Fire.

A statement from the Mountains and Plains grants hub, established by the EPA in 2022, called the decision to cut the grants “deeply” disappointing.

“The goal was to fund solutions to serious environmental challenges in underserved communities — from providing clean drinking water to ensuring food access, climate readiness and more,” the statement read. “We received nearly 550 applications, requesting over $137 million — a clear sign of both the urgency and the local energy behind this work.”

What Boulder’s lost funding would have done

FLOWS had planned to use the grant to expand work on clean water access at the San Lazaro mobile home community, where residents have endured foul-smelling and -tasting water sourced from a nearby trout pond for more than 15 years.

“Water is a human right,” Gabrieloff-Parish said. “The loss of this funding doesn’t just pause a project – it puts a frontline community’s well-being at risk.”

The group was also planning two other initiatives: an ecosystem restoration project at Tantra Lake affordable housing and a long-planned climate resilience hub.

The restoration project would have replaced turf with native plants and rain gardens while educating residents about Indigenous land practices and water stewardship. It may continue at a smaller scale, if other funding comes through.

The resilience hub, which FLOWS has championed since 2016, would have served as a neighborhood resource for planning how to respond to wildfires, floods and other climate-related disasters and use water and energy more sustainably. It is now delayed indefinitely.

“This should be a priority for the whole community,” Gabrieloff-Parish said. “There’s climate action to try to prevent the changes that are coming, but adaptation and resilience building has to be a part of our strategy now.”

She said FLOWS is unique because it builds leadership from within the communities it serves, rather than imposing outside solutions and walking away. The group’s three staff members – whose jobs are now in jeopardy – all come from frontline communities themselves.

“We want to be a part of identifying the problems and naming the solutions that we’d like to see,” she said. “We’re not just looking for free stuff like heat pumps or solar panels.”

Coal ash contamination and fears of being silenced

The Boulder County Climate Justice Collaborative was planning to use its EPA grant to help residents respond to coal ash pollution from Xcel Energy’s Valmont Power Station, located just outside Boulder city limits. A 2023 Boulder Reporting Lab investigation found that coal ash, which contains toxic metals like arsenic and cobalt, stored at the site is in direct contact with groundwater and appears to be migrating slowly underground toward homes. As Xcel Energy prepares to clean up the site, new concerns have emerged about the potential air quality impacts of disturbing and releasing the ash into the air.

According to Alejandro Murillo, a member of the group’s steering committee, the EPA grant would have funded training for community members on how to provide public comment on Xcel’s cleanup permits, especially the one addressing air quality risks. It also would have supported community efforts to monitor air quality independently of Xcel, and connected residents with public health officials who could provide resources in case they experienced health issues related to the coal ash.

Now, that work is in limbo. EPA funding represented about 90% of the project’s budget.

“We’re going to make do with what we have,” Murillo said. “Given general federal administration changes, a lot of people also just don’t feel comfortable going to a training, so we’ve had to rethink that as well.”

Murillo added that fear is growing among the community, especially undocumented and Latino residents, due to Trump policies targeting immigrants.

“It’s very possible that some of these agencies could show up to this event without our knowing, and we don’t want to put people at risk of that,” he said. “So that’s why we’ve stopped all of our in-person team meetings.”

The group may hold one online training in lieu of four in-person ones, but Murillo said it won’t have the same impact.

“The suppression of voices, while maybe indirect, is definitely felt,” he said. “People are just nervous, and with good reason.”

He added that the EPA rules like the one that forced Xcel to address the coal ash pollution in the first place may be compromised if the agency continues to roll back or defund regulations.

“Here is a local source of pollution that’s literally contaminating groundwater [and] could be contaminating our air once the work gets done,” he said. “But [environmental] regulations are just being thrown out.”

“Without the EPA intact, we might have never known that this was a problem and this needed to get fixed.”

‘We need a local Justice40’

With the federal program gone, advocates like Gabrieloff-Parish are turning their focus to local government.

“We don’t have the federal Justice40, but we could have a local Justice40,” she said. ” “Climate is a priority of the county; it’s a priority of the City of Boulder. This whole state is really committed to climate. Let’s make it environmental justice, not just environment.”

She’s calling on local governments to adopt similar commitments — directing 40% of their climate spending to underserved communities.

With that investment, she said the communities most vulnerable to climate change could “be a part of the transition that we’re making locally.”",https://boulderreportinglab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3150-ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-converter-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 05:03:33.421533

AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects them to stabilize at 3.3% over the coming years.","The car industry is buzzing with news about Toyota — yes, Toyota — announcing it has big plans to bring more battery-powered electric and plug-in hybrid models to customers in the US between now and the end of the decade. Wait, Toyota said that? Yes, Virginia, it did.

Cheater Dawson of Bloomberg reports that stodgy Toyota has announced plans to manufacture two new battery electric vehicles in the US. By two years from now, a total of seven Toyota EVs will be in the company’s US showrooms. Those US-made EVs will join three other new EV’s imported from Japan — the bZ Woodland, the all new CH-R, and a version of the Lexus ES sedan — and the two EVs currently available in America — the Toyota bZ (previously known as the bZ4X) and the Lexus RZ. 80% of Toyota and Lexus models sold in the US today offer customers a choice of a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Bloomberg notes that Toyota typically does not add a new model to a factory unless it expects to sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production is in full swing. For instance, its factory in Georgetown, Kentucky, is the biggest Toyota factory in the world. It cranks out 550,000 versions of the RAV4, Camry, and Lexus ES a year. Now one of the new battery-electric models will be built there as well. The Camry went all-hybrid last year, and the company will stop offering a gasoline-only version of the RAV4 in its next model year.

The other new EV will be assembled at the Toyota factory in Princeton, Indiana, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year. That factory currently makes the Highlander, Grand Highlander, and Sienna minivan.

Toyota Expects EV Growth

Company executives are saying they expect slow but steady growth in EV sales in the US, which is actually kind of hopeful, given that Congress and the current failed US president intend to rip up California’s EV waiver, impose additional fees on electric cars, revoke the $7,500 federal tax credit, and eviscerate the production incentives for battery manufacturing provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the US will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.” While EV sales may not be growing as fast in the US as proponents might like, Toyota seems comfortable with the idea that any cars it manufacturers in the US that go unsold will find buyers elsewhere.

Toyota is building battery cells for EVs and PHEVs at its new factory in Liberty, North Carolina, which will have 14 production lines when fully operational — 10 dedicated to cells for EVs and 4 for cells that will go into plug-in hybrid vehicles. The first PHEV production line will be operational in June, with the rest coming online between now and 2034. At full capacity, that factory will be able to churn out 30 GWh of batteries — enough for 800,000 tiny hybrid batteries, 150,000 larger batteries for plug-in hybrids, or 300,000 for battery electric cars.

What is driving Toyota’s newfound interest in cars with batteries is a form of FOMO — fear of missing out as GM, Hyundai/Kia, and maybe Honda flood the zone with battery-powered models of their own. Toyota says it expects the share of battery electric cars in the American market to nearly double by 2030. “BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us. They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

More PHEVs From Toyota

While all this EV goodness is going on, Toyota is also planning to add more plug-in hybrids to its model lineup. Last year, 2.4% of its sales were PHEVs, but the company expects that to climb to 20% of its sales in the US by 2030.

According to a report by CNBC, the first PHEV from Toyota was a Prius model that debuted in 2016, a little known fact most readers will be surprised to learn. PHEVs have often had wimpy battery-only range — sometimes less than 10 miles — but long-range plug-ins are starting to light up the sales charts in China. BYD even has a few models that can drive more than 1300 miles on a combination of battery and internal combustion power. Purists may carp that PHEVs are not real electric cars, and they are right, but if range anxiety is preventing someone from taking the electric car plunge, 1,300 miles ought to calm those jitters.

“We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company’s North American headquarters. “We love the PHEV powertrain. We’re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range. We’re looking at plug-ins across the lineup, and it’s more a function of where can we build them, and what is the product strength versus the competition,” Christ said.

Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, told CNBC, “The growth [in PHEVs] is likely limited due to the expensive dual powertrain cost structure. For those already invested, it may make sense to continue along the path. However, for those who haven’t already made significant investments, it is a large incremental cost that must be balanced.”

S&P Global sees PHEV sales in the US growing from about 2 percent last year to 5 percent by the end of the decade. That is considerably less than Toyota is forecasting. AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects them to stabilize at 3.3% over the coming years. Either Toyota or the chattering classes see the future clearly and will be proven correct in the fullness of time.

PHEV sales for Toyota and Lexus increased by 39% last year, according to company data. “We’re looking across the lineup and saying, ‘How many powertrains can we offer on what products?’” Christ said. “We are going to increase the percentage of hybrids and PHEVs.” We at CleanTechnica have been criticizing Toyota for years for dragging its feet on the transition to battery-powered cars.

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026.

When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather.
The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.","“Energy security,” the principle that when you flip a light switch the lights will turn on, is something that most Americans take for granted. But the mechanics behind it incorporate both century-old transmission towers and the latest in renewable energy technology.

Last month, we wrote about a suite of energy-focused orders issued by the Trump Administration. Since then, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued three additional orders related to electricity generation or transmission in Puerto Rico (here and here) and Michigan (here) under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (FPA).

These orders aim to ensure grid reliability amidst challenges involving weather, infrastructure, and shifts in energy policy. As we discuss below, while these orders may appear ideological, they are targeted to specific local problems that could cause blackouts.

Resilience in US Generation Policy

Federal and state governments, along with private actors, play crucial roles in US electric generation policymaking. The DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) set national energy policies, while state governments implement local priorities, leading to a diverse energy landscape. Weather impacts both electric demand and infrastructure itself. Federal and state officials share the responsibility to responding to weather events, with federal officials responsible for setting standards for resilience projects, funding initiatives, and coordinating emergency response.

In April, the president issued an Executive Order titled “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,” which expanded the role of the federal government in energy policy. Specifically, it authorized the use of emergency powers to require existing fossil fuel-fired power plants to stay online. Citing its earlier declaration of a “National Energy Emergency,” the Administration preemptively invoked Section 202 of the FPA, which allows FERC to require specific energy generation or facility interconnection to meet energy demands in times of war or emergency. The three orders discussed below are the first the Administration has issued under this authority.

May 16 Puerto Rico Orders

Puerto Rico’s electrical grid faces challenges stemming both from geography (i.e., being a tropical island without fossil fuel resources) as well as history (e.g., underinvestment and weather events, including three hurricanes and major earthquakes in the past decade). In April, following an island-wide blackout, the governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Order EO-2025-016, declaring a state of emergency for Puerto Rico’s electric system.

On May 16, citing Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The first order sets out emergency measures for generation and the second sets out emergency measures for transmission. The orders together compel short-term actions to address well-known risks to the stability of Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

The risks are both recently chronicled and not in dispute. This year, a systems analysis, conducted by Puerto Rican officials, determined that any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power. To minimize potential power losses, DOE ordered that 34 fossil-fuel fired units, some of them mothballed, be made available for 90 days (subject to being extended) to promote grid reliability.

In terms of transmission, DOE’s order also notes that Puerto Rico’s transmission lines are “currently operated with up to 70% derating to avoid failures from infrastructure conditions (e.g. line sagging into vegetation)” and that lack of vegetation control on transmission and distribution rights-of-ways is “one of the main causes of power failures.” Localized transmission failures can cascade into larger issues. Accordingly, DOE ordered PREPA to reestablish rights-of-way by managing vegetation and report back to DOE on its progress in 90 days, with DOE deploying regulatory heft to addressing long-term issues to the Puerto Rico electric grid.

The Michigan Order

A week later, DOE issued an emergency order to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy directing them to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant [set to close on May 31, 2025] is available to operate.” The Campbell plant was rated to produce 1,560 MW of electricity. This order trumps a state order — supported by the facility owner — to shut down the plant.

The Michigan order noted that “[m]ultiple generation facilities in Michigan have retired in recent years” and since “2020, about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity have been retired and no new coal-fired facilities are planned.” Indeed, since the middle of 2024, 1,575 megawatts of capacity were retired. A regulatory assessment issued May 14 forecast an increased potential for regulatory shortfalls. To address these forecasted shortfalls, the order requires that, for a period of 90 days, MISO and Consumers must “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate. For the duration of this order, MISO is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” The essential effect of this order is that the Campbell Plant will continue to operate for at least the next 90 days to better allow DOE to understand whether shutting down the plant will negatively affect the overall electric grid.

What to Watch

We’ve talked a lot about the Administration’s energy deregulation. How do the DOE orders listed above fit within that deregulation scheme? Here are three notable points about how they may be consistent:

1. The Orders are Not Necessarily Ideological

It is easy to see power generation as an ideological issue particularly in light of the Administration’s desire to “Reinvigorate America’s Beautiful Clean Coal.” But, at least in the short term, fossil fuel generation would continue in Puerto Rico as it always has because, according to federal regulators, fossil fuel plants accounted for 93% of Puerto Rico’s generation capacity in 2024, with petroleum-fired power plants themselves accounting for 62%. Rather than encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels, the orders largely seem focused on minimizing blackouts.

2. Local Control of Power Generation Isn’t Ending

The orders likely reflect a cautious approach intended to promote grid stability and likely do not themselves address the transition from fossil fuels. The orders in both states react to local conditions, such as recent grid instability in Puerto Rico and Michigan’s spate of fossil fuel resource retirement. In both locations, the orders are at least nominally consistent with local political realities. The transmission-focused order in Puerto Rico indicates that some of the concerns raised in the order originated at recent meetings with local stakeholders. Puerto Rican government officials reportedly supported the orders. In Michigan, this order followed a May 7 county commission resolution requesting that state regulators postpone the plant’s retirement.

3. The Orders Will Last Longer Than Previous 202(c) Orders

Finally, the FPA 202(c) orders here initially last 90 days with requirements for reporting back to DOE. When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather. (See examples here and here.) During the first Administration DOE entertained (but denied) a request from coal-related generation concerns to keep a number of coal-fired plants running for grid reliability concerns using the same provision.

The Puerto Rico and Michigan orders were issued under FPA Section 202(c) and were intended to address “emergency” situations, rather than FPA Section 202(b), which federal regulators have historically used to improve operational efficiency and reliability of the electric grid under non-emergency conditions. The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 04:00:18.604345

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives.","As of February, Forsyth County has 2,947 registered electric vehicles (EVs) and Guilford County has 4,745, marking year-over-year increases of about 42% and 45%, respectively.

According to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), the number of registered EVs in Forsyth and Guilford counties rose from 442 and 799 in February 2020 to 927 and 1,454 in 2022, and further to 2,075 and 3,262 in February 2024.

The numbers include both all-electric vehicles, which don’t produce any exhaust emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which don’t release emissions when operating in electric mode.

Timothy Johnson, professor of the Practice of Energy and the Environment at Duke University, noted that while both counties’ growth rates appear impressive, they still represent an “increase from a relatively small number,” a trend seen across much of the country, except in states like California, where demand is significantly higher.

“You've seen a much greater market share of EVs in other countries — Denmark, and some of the other Nordic countries, as well as China, are going gangbusters on electric vehicles. We're just not seeing that in the U.S.”

In a survey published by EY last year, only 34% of U.S. consumers intending to buy a new vehicle in the next 24 months planned to purchase an EV, marking a 14% decrease from 48% in 2023. A lack of charging stations, limited driving range, battery life and expensive maintenance fees were among the key factors contributing to this decline, as cited by the survey.

How EVs help cut carbon

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has aligned with the president’s pro-coal stance, often promoting his “Drill, baby, drill” slogan and praising Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s calls to keep coal plants active in the country in its social media posts.

Nonetheless, the department’s website emphasizes a different message, stating that using hybrid vehicles and EVs “supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet.”

“The multiple fuel sources used to generate electricity result in a more secure energy source for the electrified portion of the transportation sector,” it adds.

In North Carolina, former Gov. Roy Cooper set a statewide goal of reaching 1.25 million registered zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030 under Executive Order 246. His earlier goal of reaching 80,000 registered EVs by 2025, outlined in Executive Order 80, was surpassed in November 2023, which Gov. Josh Stein praised the achievement then as a reflection of the state’s commitment to the EV sector.

“Most EVs will automatically reduce life-cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 50% from their gasoline powered counterparts,” said Noah Kittner, an assistant professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The U.S. Department of Energy states that a small electric SUV produces 52% fewer life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline vehicle.

The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States, and greenhouse gases are the key contributors to climate change, driving rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, which impact both the environment and public health, as noted by researchers and scientists around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The biggest environmental benefits of electric vehicles have to do with air quality and pollutant emissions…shifting from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles moves the emissions to power plants, which are far fewer in number, and since they don't move around, they're easier to control,” Johnson said.

Why EVs make economic sense — but policy still lags

Mark Curtis, associate professor and Reynolds Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, explained that EVs are “simply better products than internal combustion cars” from an economic standpoint.

“They are cheaper to own over the life of the car, they require less maintenance, and they perform better,” Curtis said. “They accelerate faster, have fewer parts, and don’t need oil changes or regular engine repairs. For most drivers, especially those who can charge at home, they are already the better option.”

According to a 2020 analysis by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Idaho National Laboratory (INL), drivers can save up to $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years by choosing an electric vehicle instead of a similar gasoline-powered one.

Gas-powered cars, Curtis added, create significant economic costs by negatively impacting people's health and reducing their productivity.

“Yet under current rules, those damages are not priced into the cost of driving,” Curtis said.

Unlike states such as California and Colorado, North Carolina does not have state-level rebate programs or tax incentives. Instead, Duke Energy offers a one-time rebate of up to $1,133 to help households prepare for at-home EV charging, which Curtis noted as “particularly relevant” in Winston-Salem and Greensboro, where many residents live in single-family homes.

“It’s worth noting that utilities have an interest in encouraging EV charging at certain times because it could actually save the utilities money in terms of grid operational costs and distribution system upgrades,” Kittner said.

Kittner expressed skepticism, however, about North Carolina adopting incentives or rebates, pointing out the recent decision by the N.C. General Assembly to raise the annual registration fee for fully electric vehicles from $140 to $180.

“Recent policies suggest that there may be additional fees levied on EV owners,” he added. “So it seems the current proposals are increasing costs of adoption rather than providing new rebates or incentives.”

What’s at stake in New York?

20,300 jobs lost if clean energy credits are repealed

$3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP by 2032

Up to $650/year in higher energy bills for New Yorkers

Schumer called the proposal “a gut punch to New York and a gift to China,” warning that without U.S. tax credits, clean energy manufacturing will shift overseas.

Clean energy projects in danger

Key programs targeted by the repeal include:

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit – Up to $3,200 for home upgrades

Residential Clean Energy Credit – 30% off solar panels and heat pumps

Clean Electricity Investment Credits – Support for wind, solar, and hydro

Advanced Manufacturing Credits – Driving growth in battery and EV sectors

Electric Vehicle Tax Credits – Lower costs for new and used EVs

Clean Hydrogen Credit – Supporting companies like Plug Power in NY

Real projects, real impact

Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed:

Empire Wind off Long Island drew $5 billion in offshore wind investment

Plug Power added jobs in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region with green hydrogen production

Viridi Parente in Buffalo expanded domestic battery production

Solar Liberty installed panels using federal incentives

GE Vernova added a wind turbine line, creating 200 jobs in Schenectady

Schumer said the rollback would not only shutter these projects but also stall America’s energy independence.

“Without these credits,” Schumer said, “families pay more, companies lay off workers, and China wins.”

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.
“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about the specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
“Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.” Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.
The Trump administration has been quick to disregard climate change and has moved against initiatives aimed at combating it.","In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother’s fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car’s air conditioning wasn’t working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday’s filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.”

Chevron Corporation counsel Theodore Boutrous Jr. said in a statement: “Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense. The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.”

ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about the specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.”

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming. Recently, Hawaii and Michigan announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, though the states have been met by counter lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department.

The Trump administration has been quick to disregard climate change and has moved against initiatives aimed at combating it. The U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change. And the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company’s greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Looking ahead, it’s hard to imagine this will be an isolated incident,” said Don Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School. “We’re facing an escalating climate crisis. It’s a sobering thought that this year, the hottest on record, will almost certainly be one of the coolest we’ll experience for the foreseeable future.

“It is predictable or — to use a legal term, foreseeable — that the loss of life from these climate-fueled disasters will likely accelerate as climate chaos intensifies,” he added. “At the heart of all this is the argument about the culpability of fossil fuel companies, and it rests on a large and growing body of evidence that these companies have understood the dangers of their products for decades.”

“The university is aligning its future development plans with the vision laid out in Rio Grande District Plan.
The Salt Lake City Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) is leading the larger Rio Grande Plan, for which the U land is a critical component.
The plan calls for a complete makeover of the land encircling the Utah Transit Authority’s Salt Lake Central Station just west of the historic depot.
Remediating the contamination on the university property will make it so their site can be incorporated into the implementation of this vision for the Rio Grande District,” Lindsley said.","University officials have secured a $2 million federal grant to clean up a contaminated 2-acre plot in Salt Lake City’s Rio Grande District, bringing much-needed funds to kickstart the revitalization of a blighted part of downtown.

The money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s brownfield remediation program, designed to help bring distressed, but otherwise valuable real estate back into use.

“This area has long been an industrial railroad corridor and it’s exciting to play a role in its revitalization,” said Isabeau Tavo, the University of Utah’s deputy director of real estate development, at a press event Thursday outside the historic Rio Grande Depot. “The university is aligning its future development plans with the vision laid out in Rio Grande District Plan. The vision transforms the heart of the district into a vibrant innovation hub.”

Joining U officials at the announcement were officials with the city, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and EPA Regional Director Cyrus Western. The award is part of the $267 million in brownfields grants announced nationally by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“Projects like this are just one chapter of this city and of this basin,” said Western, until recently a Wyoming lawmaker. “Someone could drive through here and come to the conclusion this space isn’t worth much, there’s no potential here, there’s nothing that can be done here. But these brownfield projects are a good example of when we have local partners, we can in fact turn it into something that is incredible.”

The University of Utah Research Foundation acquired the land in 2021 in the form of seven adjacent parcels along 400 South at 550 West, about one block southwest of the historic Rio Grande Depot, the architectural anchor of the ambitious redevelopment project targeting 20 blighted acres on the west side of downtown.

Redevelopment of the land stalled over the need to remove hazardous materials, such as arsenic and volatile organic compounds, permeating the ground, the legacy of myriad industrial uses dating back to 1911. All the buildings have been razed since the U bought the land for $6.8 million and only foundations and weeds remain.

The Salt Lake City Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) is leading the larger Rio Grande Plan, for which the U land is a critical component. The plan calls for a complete makeover of the land encircling the Utah Transit Authority’s Salt Lake Central Station just west of the historic depot.

“We are tying to capitalize on our access to transit to make this walkable and bikable and sustainable and have a great place with a lot of active uses that will bring the district to life,” said Cara Lindsley, the CRA’s deputy director. “The plan calls for breaking up our large city blocks into a more walkable scale. By doing this we create safe and comfortable connections. When this is fully realized this will really be a memorable destination.”

However, little of this vision can be accomplished without support from landowners along with state and federal agencies.

“There are unique challenges to redevelopment before land can be returned to productive use and these challenges often require multiple partners come to the table. Remediating the contamination on the university property will make it so their site can be incorporated into the implementation of this vision for the Rio Grande District,” Lindsley said. “The impact of the EPA’s and university’s investment in this district can’t be overstated.”

The total cost of the cleanup is expect to exceed the EPA grant by up to $1.5 million, which will be covered by the U. That work will entail a combination of removing contaminated soil and treating the rest in situ with chemicals that would render the contaminants harmless, according to Michael Brehm, an engineer with the U’s Environmental Health & Safety Department. The goal is to bring the ground up to environmental standards for commercial use, but not for residential use, which would be cost prohibitive.

Western praised the city and the university for making the leap to transform a blighted, but once vital part of Salt Lake City into a place that will spur economic growth and the city’s renewal.

“It’s an inspiring story. For every dollar of funding we put into projects like this it creates $20 of community impact,” he said. “It tells the story that with a little initiative and a little bit of public funding we can unlock the secret sauce of all the private dollars coming in to take it from what it is now to what it can be.”

The primary goal of the tax bill is to extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that are set to expire at the end of this year.

On May 22, House Republicans passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” under the budget reconciliation process. This marks a significant milestone in the effort to pass tax legislation by the July 4 holiday, a self-prescribed deadline set by the Republicans and White House administration. The tax bill will now move to the Senate, which is back in session on June 2.

The primary goal of the tax bill is to extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill, just as with the TCJA in 2017. Under reconciliation, only a simple majority is needed in the Senate for the bill to become law. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax bill as passed by the House would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Although it is anticipated that Senate Republicans will make several changes and tweaks to the tax bill in the upcoming weeks, critical provisions in the House version are outlined below:

Businesses and Investors

Qualified business income deduction (Section 199A) – Increases maximum deduction from 20% to 23% and makes the deduction permanent

Depreciation/expensing – Provides 100% bonus depreciation for certain property acquired between January 20, 2025, and 2029 and increases Section 179 expensing limitation from $1 million to $2.5 million

Research and development expenditures – Return to immediate expensing for domestic (but not foreign) R&D expenditures for tax years 2025 through 2029

Opportunity zones – Renews the opportunity zone program for tax years 2027 through 2033 with modifications to eligibility

Business interest – Reinstates the use of EBITDA (instead of EBIT) when determining the limitation on deducting interest for tax years 2025 through 2029

Excess business losses – Makes permanent the limitations for noncorporate taxpayers ($626,000 for joint filers and $313,000 for single filers for 2025) on deducting excess business losses

Professional sports – Limits the amount eligible for 15-year amortization of the intangible assets of professional sports franchises to 50% of the adjusted tax basis of those assets

Individuals and Estate Planning

Tax rates – Makes permanent the reduced maximum 37% federal income tax rate on ordinary income for individuals

SALT cap – Increases the deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 ($20,000 for married filing separately) with a phase-out for taxpayers earning more than $500,000 in earnings and curbs the use of state PTE tax elections designed to mitigate the SALT cap

Estate and gift tax exemption – Increases exemption to inflation-adjusted $15 million starting in 2026

Standard deduction – Makes permanent the increased standard deduction enacted by the TCJA and temporarily increases the deduction to $26,000 ($13,000 for single filers) for tax years 2025 through 2028

Tips and overtime – Establishes deductions for tips and overtime for certain taxpayers, effectively excluding tips and overtime from federal income taxation (but not payroll taxation), for tax years 2025 through 2028

MAGA accounts – Creates “money account for growth and advancement” trust accounts for U.S. citizens under 18 years old where funds can be used for qualified expenses such as higher education

Clean Energy and Renewables Industry

Electric vehicles – Repeals tax credits related to electric vehicles starting in 2026 but retains a limited tax credit for electric vehicles from certain manufacturers that have produced fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles

Clean electricity production and investment tax credits – Accelerates phasing out these credits (Section 45Y and Section 48E) starting after 2028 and changes eligibility from when facilities begin construction to when they enter service

Clean hydrogen – Repeals the clean hydrogen production tax credit (Section 45V) for projects beginning after 2025

Residential solar – Eliminates production and investment tax credits for many solar facilities that are leased to homeowners

Selling tax credits – Eliminates the ability to sell many tax credits after 2027

EVs accounted for 1.3 million vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.
Toyota's Coming EV Lineup Sounds Good To keep up with that growing demand, there will be a lineup of seven fully electric vehicles offered in the U.S. by 2027 between Toyota and Lexus.
Those will stick around indefinitely, and Toyota will introduce the bZ Woodland version, and the recently-revealed C-HR EV to the U.S., both in the coming year.
That means Toyota is looking into exporting those two new EVs it'll produce stateside to other markets.","Toyota made a promise a few years ago to have an electrified version of each model in its lineup - either hybrid or fully electric - by the end of 2025, and it's on track to meet that goal. It's paying off, as around 80% of sales between Toyota and Lexus are already electrified in some way, so it's only going to improve, thanks in no small part to cars like the Prius and Camry.

Now, the automaker projects EV sales in the U.S. will likely double by the end of the decade, and it has plans to introduce plenty of new products to keep up - a major reversal of the position it was peddling just a few short years ago, where some executives claimed the shift to electric vehicles was overhyped.

The State Of Electrified Toyota Right Now

Sales of Toyota's hybrids are skyrocketing, helped by the fact that the Prius looks good now, the Camry lineup has gone completely electrified as hybrids, and the RAV4 will follow suit with a fresh lineup of hybrids for its updated model year. However, the Japanese automaker only sold around 30,000 EVs in the U.S. in 2024, which is far below its typical sales expectations for traditional vehicles that range in the hundreds of thousands.

Still, the company believes EVs are the future, and that the share of EV sales in the U.S. is likely to double in the next five years. EVs accounted for 1.3 million vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.

Toyota's Coming EV Lineup Sounds Good

To keep up with that growing demand, there will be a lineup of seven fully electric vehicles offered in the U.S. by 2027 between Toyota and Lexus. Currently, there's the recently-renamed Toyota bZ SUV on offer, and its related Lexus RZ SUV. Those will stick around indefinitely, and Toyota will introduce the bZ Woodland version, and the recently-revealed C-HR EV to the U.S., both in the coming year. By 2027, we should expect an all-electric trim of the lovely new Lexus ES, joined by two new EVs that will be produced stateside.

Toyota's American Production Is Growing

Toyota's Georgetown, Kentucky, plant will get one of the still-mysterious EVs, and another will be assembled at the company's Princeton, Indiana, facility. Toyota also has a Liberty, North Carolina battery facility that will eventually have the capacity to turn out 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries for new models, though that will be less, as the plant capacity is split to also produce hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle batteries, as well.

In an interview with Bloomberg, senior VP Cooper Ericksen at Toyota said: ""We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market. But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations."" That means Toyota is looking into exporting those two new EVs it'll produce stateside to other markets.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2026-toyota-bz-woodland-8.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 21:01:01.653765

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
“Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.""
Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.
The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon.","In one of the nation’s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother's fatal hyperthermia.

The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.

On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit day — the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car's air conditioning wasn't working.

Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.

The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company. ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

“Defendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth’s atmosphere,” when Juliana was born, Thursday's filing said. “By 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.”

The filing adds: “The extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.""

The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.

International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 “heat dome” was “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.”

Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

“We’ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about this specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Scientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.""

Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.

The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.

“Big Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn’t change their business model,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. “But instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.”

Unprecedented action

States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet’s warming. Recently, Hawaii and Michigan announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, though the states have been met by counter lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department.

The current administration has been quick to disregard climate change and related jargon. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, again; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted — will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change; and the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.

Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company's greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.

Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual’s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.

“Looking ahead, it’s hard to imagine this will be an isolated incident,” said Don Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School. ""We’re facing an escalating climate crisis. It’s a sobering thought that this year, the hottest on record, will almost certainly be one of the coolest we’ll experience for the foreseeable future.

“It is predictable or — to use a legal term, foreseeable — that the loss of life from these climate-fueled disasters will likely accelerate as climate chaos intensifies,” he added. “At the heart of all this is the argument about the culpability of fossil fuel companies, and it rests on a large and growing body of evidence that these companies have understood the dangers of their products for decades.”

The bill, SB 0041, was introduced in January and has since been referred to the Senate Assignments Committee and the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee.

The proposed clean transportation standard would take the form of a credit marketplace monitored by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Airline, rail, ocean-going and military fuel would be exempt from the program.

The legislation directs state agencies to propose and adopt rules to establish the CTS within 24 months of the bill being signed into law. The program would initially required a 25% CI reduction over 10 years when compared to a 2019 baseline. Further reductions would be required over the following decade.

In calculating CI reductions, the program would recognize farm emissions reductions that contributed to the reduced CI of fuels by allowing credit generators to use individualized farm-level CI scoring for approved sustainable agricultural practices and requiring the state agencies to use the U.S. Department of Energy GREET models’ feedstock carbon intercity calculator to determine individualized farm-level CI scoring.

The bill also includes provisions implementing a price cap on compliance credits designed to contain costs if fuel supply forecasts determine that not enough credits would be available. The credit price cap would be adjusted annually for inflation.

A full copy of the bill is available on the Illinois legislature website.

If the GOP plan to raise taxes on clean energy goes through and American projects are halted, experts fear it could help American adversaries like China solidify dominance in low-cost, clean energy manufacturing.","New York, N.Y. – Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stood with trade workers and others to caution that the House-passed GOP tax bill will kill clean energy investments that are key to lowering electricity costs, creating good-paying jobs, and increasing American manufacturing independence. Since Schumer led the Inflation Reduction Act to passage three years ago, companies announced plans to invest $843 billion in projects, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. Leader Schumer warns the GOP plans to deliver a fatal blow to America’s domestic clean energy and manufacturing economy and working families – at the behest of Big Oil and billionaires – and says the Republican plan must be stopped.

Today, standing at the largest rooftop solar array in Manhattan, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) warned that the GOP’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” would decimate clean energy, kill over 800,00 jobs, and raise costs for American families, according to Energy Innovation. With the goal of funding tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, the House-passed bill would eliminate clean energy tax credits, which would cut hundreds of thousands of clean energy and manufacturing jobs, and millions of related jobs. Schumer also said the tax hikes on clean energy this bill are expected to drive up monthly energy bills by almost 10% across the country, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association. Schumer sounded the alarm and warned the GOP to back off this disastrous plan to bow to Big Oil billionaires.

“This so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America’s clean energy economy and a huge amount jobs across the country,” said Leader Schumer. “It’s a job-killer, a cost-raiser, and a giveaway to Big Oil billionaires — all at the expense of workers, and American families. That is why the GOP plan to deliver a tax cut to billionaires at the expense of lower bills and cleaner energy for all must be stopped.”

Three years ago, Leader Schumer spear-headed the Inflation Reduction Act, leading its passaging through the Senate and into law. In just this short time, the clean energy tax credits have revolutionized America’s clean energy economy and has already created over 400,000 jobs, according to Climate Power. These incentives make it cheaper to provide more clean electricity, for families to make their homes more energy efficient and lower their energy bills, and to manufacture critical and desperately needed energy components, like batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines in the United States. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, companies have announced over $843 billion in investments in clean energy projects, with millions of good-paying jobs slated to be created across the country, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. The repeal of these incentives would vaporize thousands of jobs and jeopardize the nation’s path to energy independence.

“If Republicans succeed in gutting these tax credits, it will mean higher monthly energy bills for families and small businesses, fewer jobs for hardworking Americans, and a dangerous step backward in innovation on energy,” Schumer added. “It’s a big win for China and a big loss for American manufacturing. It means less energy diversity and higher costs for consumers and businesses.”

Additionally, study after study shows that the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy will raise costs for families and small businesses. One conservative study from the Clean Energy Buyers Association showed that small businesses in America will see a 10% increase in electricity prices next year, a cost that’s likely to be passed straight onto consumers. With the average small business spending $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the Department of Energy, the Republican plan will spell disaster for main street businesses and families across the country.

If the GOP plan to raise taxes on clean energy goes through and American projects are halted, experts fear it could help American adversaries like China solidify dominance in low-cost, clean energy manufacturing. This would make the United States more reliant on other countries for cheap energy, reduce American production of energy technology like solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and disrupt American supply chains while sending American jobs overseas.

The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the country has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, responsible for 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule.
But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in level of polluting power plant emissions.
The site of the plant, the last of the utility's nuclear power facilities, was then set to be cleared.
Michigan utility regulators termed the federal order ""unnecessary” and noted no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region.","The Trump administration has taken several new actions in recent days, some with little public notice, to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S, particularly from coal-fired plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waited until Saturday, May 24 to confirm to media, only after a New York Times report, that it is drafting a proposed regulation to eliminate all current restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants. The report is based on sources and review of internal documents.

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters. ""As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule."" The proposal is set to be published in the Federal Register after White House and federal agencies' review, possibly in June, the spokesperson said.. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had said in a previous statemen that the agency is “seeking to ensure [EPA] follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.”

The draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other plant greenhouse gases “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, according to the Times report, and that cutting emissions would have no ""meaningful effect"" on public health. The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the country has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, responsible for 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule.

But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in level of polluting power plant emissions.

EPA released no further details from the draft rule, said the Times, also speculating it could be finalized by the end of the year, “an extraordinarily fast pace.”

Supporters are optimistic but other observers expect the rule to face lawsuits if it becomes final and remain concerned it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.

""It is a good step forward in line with the rule of law,"" Thomas Pyle, president of oil and gas advocacy group American Energy Alliance, told the Washington Post.

But Vickie Patton, Environmental Defense Fund general counsel said ""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" calling the proposed rule “an abuse of [EPA] responsibility under the law. ... that flies in the face of common sense.""

'Emergency Order'

The EPA confirmation followed by one day an ‘emergency order” from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright that directs grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Michigan utility Consumers Energy, to ensure that the 1.56-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., ""remains available for operation,"" noting its planned shutdown on May 31, which DOE said ""is 15 years before the end of its scheduled design life.""

The plant's three units were built in 1962, 1967 and 1980. The site of the plant, the last of the utility's nuclear power facilities, was then set to be cleared.

Wright said the closure reversal, now set to last until Aug. 21, is authorized under the Federal Power Act and ""is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency.""

Michigan utility regulators termed the federal order ""unnecessary” and noted no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region. Katie Carey, a Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement said, the utiity ""plans to comply with the 90-day pause. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company.”

The utility had announced in February an agreement with Ashcor USA Inc., a unit of ATCO Ltd., to extract and repurpose millions of tons of impounded coal ash from the J.H. Campbell site to be made into a high-grade cement substitute.

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration moved on May 22 to support a lawsuit by Texas and 12 other states against large private infrastructure investors Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advsors that claims they conspired to reduce competition in the U.S. coal sector that risks undermining the federal goal of domestic energy independence. The U.S. Justice Dept. and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case that State Street called “baseless.”

President Donald Trump also signed four executive orders to propel a faster buildout of U.S. nuclear power plants, including a directive for the Energy and Defense Departments to construct reactors at military bases, on federal lands and sited near data centers.

The orders also seek strategies for how reactors could be constructed without approval of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and sets a goal to increase U.S. nuclear power generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up fourfold from the current 100 GW level that is the putput of more than than 90 operating reactors.

The Tennessee Valley Authority last month submitted to the agency the first portion of a construction permit application to build a GE Hitachi BWRX-300 small modular reactor at its Clinch River nuclear site in Oak Ridge, Tenn. If built, the Clinch River unit will serve as a flagship for U.S. commercial deployment of the SMR design,

“The application is essentially the blueprint for the plant’s design and safety systems, and the NRC must approve the plans before construction could begin,” TVA said, noting that it will submit the full construction permit application by the end of June.

TVA has contracted Bechtel, Sargent & Lundy and GE Hitachi as its team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1, the companies said. GE Hitachi is the designer of the BWRX-300 system.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/05/29/CAMPBELL-COALPLANTCONSUMERS-ENERGY.jpg?height=635&t=1748556788&width=1200,N,,2025-05-29 20:07:09.703897

Production of two American-made all-electric models is slated to begin next year, joining three new imported EVs Toyota aims to have in U.S. showrooms in the coming months and two currently available. By mid-2027, a total of seven EVs will be showing up in its U.S. dealerships.

The new battery-powered cars will help fulfill the company’s pledge to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year. So far, just under 80% of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the United States offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Toyota typically doesn’t add a model to a plant unless it’s confident it can sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production fully ramps up. Company executives say they expect slow but steady growth in U.S. EV sales. At the same time, faster adoption in overseas markets offers an outlet for any U.S. production in excess of domestic demand.

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.”

That’s assuming President’s Donald Trump’s tariffs don’t upend the U.S. auto market and spur a retaliatory trade war.

The Japanese automaker is on track to start shipping lithium-ion batteries later this year from a massive plant in the rural town of Liberty, North Carolina, that sprawls over 1,850 acres. Of that facility’s 14 production lines, 10 are dedicated to electric vehicle battery cells, with the remainder going to hybrid batteries.

It will supply cells earmarked for use in the two U.S.-made EVs.

The battery factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to be operational next month and the others will be brought online through 2034, the company said. It aims for production greater than 30 gigawatt hours at full capacity, or the equivalent of 800,000 hybrid, 150,000 plug-in hybrid and 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries.

Total EV sales rose 7.3% in the United States last year to some 1.3 million vehicles, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelly Blue Book. But Toyota delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the United States in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics skyrocketed.

The Japanese carmaker has been slower to jump on the EV bandwagon than most of its global rivals. It emerged as one of the biggest critics of policies designed to hasten EV adoption in the United States and has called on American policymakers to allow the market to dictate demand.

But Toyota is also reluctant to cede a market currently representing about 8% of U.S. sales to rivals such as General Motors Co., Tesla Inc., and Hyundai Motor Co. The company expects battery electrics’ share of the American market to nearly double by 2030.

“BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us; They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

In addition to the all-electric bZ4X — which soon will be renamed the bZ — and Lexus RZ that it sells now, Toyota will add three more import EV models next year: The bZ Woodland, CH-R crossover and a version of the Lexus ES sedan.

Toyota’s factory in Georgetown, Kentucky — its largest plant globally - currently manufactures some 550,000 vehicles annually, including top-selling models such as the RAV4 small SUV, Camry sedan and Lexus ES. The Camry went all-hybrid last year and the RAV4 will stop offering a gasoline-only version in its next model year. Toyota hasn’t disclosed the name of the all-electric model that will made there.

Similarly, it hasn’t provided details about the EV that will join larger models such as its Highlander SUV, Grand Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan that are made at its Princeton, Indiana, factory, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PDTN/83923544007-toyotabg-vcmqzasuvjav-5-oitwn-2-tnebiwq.jpg?crop=3861,2174,x6,y284&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-30 01:02:04.422083

Ford's Marshall battery plant has faced scrutiny for its ties to a Chinese company and has already seen reduced incentives due to lowered production expectations.

Ford Motor Co. Executive Chair Bill Ford, speaking at the Mackinac Policy Conference, sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford Motor's investment in a Marshall plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said on May 29.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The Senate still must deal with the bill, which Democrats oppose and has drawn criticism from some fiscally conservative senators.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles.

One Big Beautiful Bill = Higher Energy Bills Regardless of where Americans personally stand on clean energy, most will feel the impact of repeal right away in their energy bills.","There is no world where raising cumulative annual energy costs in the US by a staggering $16 billion this decade and killing some 830,000 jobs is a good idea.

But that’s exactly what the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that recently passed the US House of Representatives would do, according to analysis of the bill’s initial text from Energy Innovation. (And that was before lawmakers added deeper cuts to clean energy programs.)

The bill is now in the hands of the Senate where concerns about the impact of repealing clean energy programs are just one point in a long list of objections.

Take action: Tell the Senate to protect clean energy investments cutting costs and climate pollution.

While there is hope the Senate will blunt the all-out assault of the House text, it would be a mistake to assume senators’ concerns will translate into a fundamentally different bill. After all, 21 members of the House made a splash earlier in the process with a much-publicized letter of support for clean energy initiatives. Only for every one of these members to ultimately vote to repeal them. (At least every member able to stay awake.)

Why is Congress Messing with Success?

The real head-scratcher here is why clean energy programs are even on the chopping block in the first place.

Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, clean energy incentives and credits had helped advance over 400,000 jobs and $441 billion in investments across 49 states and Puerto Rico through the end of 2024, according to Climate Power. By any political measure, that’s an incredible success story.

But even for the millions of Americans working in entirely different sectors and living miles away from all the battery and electric vehicle factories sprouting up across the Southeast, clean energy programs have been critical in one very important way: helping hold energy prices down. Not just in the near term either, but also, according to testimony from Center for American Progress (CAP), by shifting the direction of travel of the entire US economy toward more and more cheap renewable energy.

What this means, as the CAP report notes, is that prior to the House budget bill, “household energy costs are on course to drop by one-third by 2035, an annual savings of roughly $2,000 per household.”

Why? The answer is pretty simple: Regardless of where you stand on climate, average electricity costs from clean energy are just cheaper than fossil energy pretty much everywhere.

What this means is that the best way to keep power bills affordable is to add more wind and solar to the electrical grid. (Even accounting for calm days and evenings.)

The cost question becomes even more urgent at a time when demand for electricity is skyrocketing from power-hungry data centers and other users, threatening to boost consumer bills by as much as 70% by 2029.

So far, solar, wind, and battery storage have been instrumental in meeting this moment, providing an incredible 93% of new energy capacity in 2024. So while the fossil fuel industry talks about “energy realism,” the reality is that clean energy – not coal, oil, and gas – is helping the US quickly add new energy to the grid while keeping costs down.

Why mess with that?

A Plan to Kill American Clean Energy

The budget bill passed by the House sends a wrecking ball straight at the US clean energy industry behind this success.

In a nutshell, the bill effectively repeals many of the IRA incentives for wind and solar power, clean technology manufacturing, and electric vehicles.

In its current form, the bill ends the popular credits for new and used electric vehicles for most models at the end of 2025 (and adds a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers).

Credits to help homeowners install solar, heat pumps, and other clean technologies also sunset at the end of this year.

And if that wasn’t enough, the bill also ends advanced manufacturing credits in 2031 for companies investing in US factories to build batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy components while making the credits largely unworkable in the interim

On the generation side, the bill adds such https://www.utilitydive.com/news/inflation-reduction-act-ira-deadline-sixty-days-construction-project-trump/748892/ and short project timelines for renewables – requiring for example, that projects begin construction within 60 daysthe end of 2028 – that few developers will likely be able to use them, including for projects already in progress.

The verdict from Wall Street was immediate. Solar stocks plunged after the House bill passed. One headline spoke of a “nightmare scenario” for the clean energy industry.

Even before the bill’s text was released, major manufacturers who’d invested billions in US factories to feed clean tech demand were warning what repeal of these credits would mean.

As Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February, “We've already sunk capital – even though we've rationalized it – in battery production and assembly plants all through Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. And many of those jobs will be at risk if the IRA is repealed.""

It’s not just major corporations concerned.

For months, Sugar Hollow Solar in Asheville, North Carolina has been working to get back on its feet, after biblical floods unleashed by Hurricane Helene swallowed the company warehouse and over $1 million of equipment. Now the budget bill threatens to erase all that progress and worse.

“After everything our community has been through – especially with the loss of our warehouse during Hurricane Helene – it’s upsetting to see legislation that would take us backward just when we need momentum the most, Doug Ager, Sugar Hollow’s founder and CEO said, “These tax credits don’t just power homes; they help rebuild lives, create jobs, and give families and small businesses like ours a chance to help in the clean energy transition.”

It's a sentiment echoed over and over all across the nation as clean energy companies grapple with this existential threat to their business, with potentially catastrophic effects for workers and the communities that depend on them. All so the wealthiest Americans can get yet another tax break.

One Big Beautiful Bill = Higher Energy Bills

Regardless of where Americans personally stand on clean energy, most will feel the impact of repeal right away in their energy bills.

As the CEO of one of the country’s largest utilities, John Ketchum of NextEra Energy, recently said in an interview with the New York Times, “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

How high is the moon? As analysis from Energy Innovation shows, the bill as introduced would lead total annual consumer energy prices to rise by a staggering $16 billion by 2030.

One of the reasons why is the bill creates a whole series of knock-on effects. For one, removing incentives for affordable clean energy means we’ll likely see less new power come online while demand rises, increasing electricity prices and jeopardizing basic reliability.

Alongside what happens in the power sector, writ large, killing these incentives

effectively pushes consumers from clean electric power and technologies (cheap and relatively stable in price) to more fossil fuel alternatives (often more expensive and volatile in price). With fewer Americans driving electric vehicles and installing heat pumps, for example, demand for oil for internal combustion engine vehicles and natural gas for home heating goes up, pushing prices up across the board.

If there is a silver lining in the budget process, it’s that the bill is not a done deal. The Senate now gets a say on what it wants and the full House will have to vote again on the results before anything heads to the president’s desk. Each vote is a chance for Americans to speak up and pressure lawmakers to protect the clean energy investments and programs putting people to work and keeping costs down for all of us. The stakes couldn’t be higher – and it’s up to us to keep the pressure on.",https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/colin-lloyd-UfsxZ-A8bDA-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 21:00:54.766415

There are many bad elements to the Republican extension of tax cuts for the rich. The plan is to sort of, but not really, pay for the tax cuts by cutting healthcare for millions, food assistance for the hungriest Americans, and harming veterans.

One of the areas that hasn’t been discussed enough is that this legislation also kills jobs, especially in the clean energy sector.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has released some data on how much damage the clean energy portion of the Republican tax cuts for the rich will cause:

Study after study shows that the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy will raise costs for families and small businesses. One conservative study from the Clean Energy Buyers Association showed that small businesses in America will see a 10% increase in electricity prices next year, a cost that’s likely to be passed straight onto consumers. With the average small business spending $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the Department of Energy, the Republican plan will spell disaster for main street businesses and families across the country.

If the GOP plan to raise taxes on clean energy goes through and American projects are halted, experts fear it could help American adversaries like China solidify dominance in low-cost, clean energy manufacturing. This would make the United States more reliant on other countries for cheap energy, reduce American production of energy technology like solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and disrupt American supply chains while sending American jobs overseas.

What’s at stake for our Country:

More than $800 Billion in investment at risk: Since the IRA passed, companies have committed billions to building clean energy and clean manufacturing in America, including in batteries, solar, and other advanced technologies

790,000 jobs on the line: These jobs are supported by clean energy tax credits and grant programs that the GOP now seeks to repeal.

Higher energy bills: Repealing the IRA would increase electricity costs and drive up everyday costs for American families and businesses, costing them hundreds of dollars more every year while also reducing access to home efficiency upgrades and energy-saving technologies.

Reduced U.S. energy independence: The tax credits under threat are central to building a domestic supply chain for batteries, solar, and clean power — all of which reduce dependence on foreign energy.

Hakeem Jeffries said on Thursday that Democrats will do everything in their power to stop this bill, but Democrats also need the American people to pressure Republican Senators to kill some of the worst portions of the House-passed legislation.

The House-passed bill will kill jobs, raise energy prices, and make China stronger.

Speaker Mike Johnson is spreading lies and falsehoods, including fantasies of economic growth, that decades of studies have revealed are unfounded. The tax cuts don’t cause economic growth, and tax cuts for the rich don’t trickle down.

The Republican passed House bill is a disaster. It will kill the sort of good jobs that Joe Biden and Democrats worked to create.

The special interest servicing Republican bill needs to be exposed, as the American people must reject this failed legislation.

The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy.

Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way.

But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.

The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.

A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.

The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.

""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.""

Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.

Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).

Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy.

""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.""

Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.

Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.

""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.

What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.

It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.

Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.

Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.

That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.

But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.

The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.

""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.

There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.

More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Tariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.

Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.

The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could ""meet the urgent moment of climate change"". It now focusses on its potential to ""harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks"".

SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be ""relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with"" makes sense.

The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.

""It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,"" says Mr Samartzis.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2b61/live/52a048b0-3bb9-11f0-a20d-1b53273f2a3b.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 22:07:19.878156

A lower court ruled the government’s review was inadequate because it did not fully consider the impacts of increased oil production and refining that could occur as a result of the railway project. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, disagreed.

“When the effects of an agency action arise from a separate project—for example, a possible future project or one that is geographically distinct from the project at hand—NEPA does not require the agency to evaluate the effects of that separate project,” he wrote.

The opinion also reins in the power of federal courts to block projects along similar grounds.

“NEPA does not allow courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand,” it said.

Now, Gov. Tina Kotek and the newly established Oregon Environmental Restoration Council will begin planning, investing and distributing that settlement money – $698 million – over the course of 50 years, using it to pay for environmental restoration and cleanup work across the state. Kotek announced the council’s chairs Wednesday, as well as details about how the money in the state’s Environmental Restoration Fund will eventually be allocated.

“The term ‘once-in-a-generation opportunity’ can be a little bit hyperbolic, but I think in this case, it’s absolutely true,” said Nicole Maness, manager of the fund. “This is a significant amount of money, and it’s coming at a time when there’s a huge amount of uncertainty around federal funding for restoration.”

The settlement money will be invested by the State Treasury, and earn interest income that will be distributed by the Environmental Restoration Council and the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board biennially, Maness said.

Half of the settlement money awarded each biennium will go to state agencies to support work on water and environmental restoration. One quarter will go to the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon for conservation and natural resources; and the remaining quarter will go to local communities and community-based organizations for projects benefitting people and neighborhoods disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The settlement

The deal between the Oregon Department of Justice and Monsanto is the largest environmental damages settlement in state history. The company agreed to pay in December 2022 to end a lawsuit brought by then Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum over allegations that Monsanto had for decades polluted state waters with Polychlorinated biphenyls, also called PCBs. Oregon is among several states that have sued the company, which has not admitted guilt or liability for the pollution.

Monsanto was for decades the only manufacturer, seller and distributor of PCBs — colorless or light yellow compounds once used in coolants, electrical equipment, hydraulic oils, paints and caulking and copy paper — until it voluntarily ceased production of the compounds in 1977. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found the compounds can cause cancer in animals, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency says they are likely human carcinogens. PCBs continue to leach from landfills and travel into ground and surface waters where they are difficult to remove.

More than a dozen waterways in Oregon are damaged by PCBs, including the Portland Harbor, Lower Columbia River, Middle Columbia River, Willamette River, Upper and Lower John Day Rivers and Coos Bay.

The money will be used for more than just trying to tackle PCB pollution, Maness said, and “in a way that is going to be meaningful to Oregonians, that is going to strike that balance between addressing past harms, but also opportunities to restore places that are important to people, important to wildlife.”

These could include removing barriers to fish passage, improving overall water quality and aquatic habitat and ensuring salmon consumed among many tribes in Oregon are abundant and safe to eat, she said.

The council

Kotek on Wednesday announced she appointed Chuck Sams, an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the former director of the National Park Service, and Michael Dembrow, former Democratic state senator representing Portland, as co-chairs of the council. She also appointed Vice Chair Cheyenne Holliday, advocacy director at the nonprofit Portland-based environmental and social justice group Verde.

“This is a tremendous opportunity for us to improve the health and living conditions of Oregonians in every part of the state, year after year for the next fifty years at least,” Dembrow said in a news release. “It’s especially important to have this stable source of funding right now, given our uncertain state budget and little hope for federal support for this important work.”

The rest of the council will be made up of the directors, or a designee of the directors, of the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality; Oregon’s attorney general or someone from the Office of the Attorney General; and two non-voting members from the Oregon House of Representatives and the Oregon Senate, chosen by those chambers.

Kotek has yet to pick the final two members of the 11-member council she gets to appoint, but Maness said they will have to possess expertise in either PCBs or a wide range of environmental toxins.

The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.
""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford on Thursday sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said at a policy conference in the state.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The tax-reform bill passed by the House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology. Ford’s factory, now under construction, would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant in 2023, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.","The U.S. Supreme Court sharply narrowed the scope of a key environmental statute on Thursday. The decision makes it easier to win approval for highways, bridges, pipelines, wind farms and other infrastructure projects.

The National Environmental Policy Act is considered the nation's premier environmental law because it sets up a regulatory regime under which the federal government seeks information from a wide array of agencies about the impact of proposed infrastructure projects before they're built.

At issue in Thursday's case was the proposed building of an 88-mile stretch of railroad that would connect Utah's oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Once built, the new rail lines would facilitate the transportation of crude oil to refineries in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast.

In carrying out the review, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board sought input from other agencies, prepared a 3,600-page report and approved the railroad project, after concluding that its transportation and economic benefits outweighed the negative impact on the environment. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington subsequently ruled that the Board had violated NEPA, by failing to consider the environmental effects from oil drilling and production, referred to as upstream, and oil refining and distribution, known as downstream.

The Supreme Court, however, reversed that ruling, and in so doing dramatically limited the 1970 law. The vote was unanimous, though Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in deliberations, and the court's three liberals wrote a more limited concurring opinion. The Court's conservatives, however, took a major whack at the NEPA law.

""They did a major cutback,"" said Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, who has written extensively about NEPA. Essentially, he said, the court had created a new categorical rule barring any consideration of the upstream and downstream effects of such projects. ""Right or wrong, that's not been the NEPA law for 50 years,"" said Lazarus.

Writing for the court majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that courts should defer to agency determinations about where to draw the line when considering environmental effects, as long as agency choices ""fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.""

Kavanaugh distinguished NEPA from other environmental laws, arguing that it's ""purely a procedural statute"" that is not meant to be ""a roadblock."" He framed his opinion as a ""judicial correction,"" pointing to ""delay after delay"" on multiple projects, which he maintained sometimes ""bordered on the Kafkaesque.""

Lazarus said Kavanaugh's opinion reads less like a judicial correction and more like a legislative policy initiative. ""He goes on this tirade where he talks about how awful NEPA has been and how it stopped all these things, how it costs jobs. And there's no citation [to any factual findings]. He's made it up,"" said Lazarus. ""It's a complete policy argument.""

At the same time, though, Lazarus conceded that over the years there has been consistent pushback against NEPA both in the courts and in Congress. He noted, for instance, that Congress, in 2023, during the Biden administration, took steps to limit some of the NEPA review.

What's more, some environmental groups have also endorsed speeding up the process, including, as Lazarus observes, ""national groups who want those transmission grids built, and those windmills up, and those solar panel huge facilities built. So NEPA has created that tension.""

But many environmental groups were dismayed by Thursday's decision. Earthjustice called the decision an invitation to the Trump administration to ""ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution requirements.""

Conversely, a large array of mining, oil, lumber, real estate and other interests were thrilled by the court's decision.

""In recent years, courts have gone farther and farther afield in demanding agencies speculate on downstream impacts over which the agencies have no control and that are beyond their regulatory authority,"" said lawyer Hadassah Reimer, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of these interest groups. She said the decision ""will promote more efficient and effective NEPA review for countless projects across the country.""

On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Florida if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in the Sunshine State. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Florida has benefited from $603 million in clean energy and transportation investments, 2,500 new jobs and 123 new clean energy and transportation facilities.

Though the tax credits that spurred this were passed by Democrats, they have overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts – 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Florida, where Florida Power and Light (FPL) and JinkoSolar have announced major investments thanks to the tax incentives.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Florida ratepayers will face electricity prices that are almost 10% higher in the coming years.

Florida installed the second-most solar power capacity in the country in 2024 and is on track to become the top-ranked residential solar state in 2028. That success will stall if the proposed rollbacks make their way to the president’s desk.

It will be a real blow to Florida residents who have been using tax credits to make rooftop solar affordable and cut their energy bills. Not only do these incentives make it easier for homeowners to install solar panels and save money, they also help stabilize our power grid.

Long-term projects that have increased production capacity and created hundreds of jobs, such as JinkoSolar’s expanded solar module plant in Jacksonville, were bolstered by tax incentives.

FPL has a “30-by-30” initiative that aims to install over 30 million solar panels by 2030, totaling more than 11,000 megawatts of solar energy generation across the state. It relies heavily on federal tax credits. Those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts. Manufacturing will slow without them.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.” Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody must join the effort to protect them.

It’s clear that protecting clean energy tax credits would be a huge boost to Florida’s economy over the next decade. An analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will spur an estimated $36 billion economic boost and support 57,200 full-time jobs in Florida annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Florida residents.

Florida is making great progress toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

The evidence is clear: Clean energy tax credits are working for Florida. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Sens. Scott and Moody to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

Toyota Motor Corp. is betting Americans are ready for more U.S.-made electric vehicles. And if they aren’t, it has a plan: exports.

Production of two American-made all-electric models is slated to begin next year, joining three new imported EVs Toyota aims to have in U.S. showrooms in the coming months and two currently available. By mid-2027, a total of seven EVs will be showing up in its U.S. dealerships.

The new battery-powered cars will help fulfill the company’s pledge to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year. So far, just under 80% of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the U.S. offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Toyota typically doesn’t add a model to a plant unless it’s confident it can sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production fully ramps up. Company executives say they expect slow but steady growth in U.S. EV sales. At the same time, faster adoption in overseas markets offers an outlet for any U.S. production in excess of domestic demand.

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.”

That’s assuming President’s Donald Trump’s tariffs don’t upend the U.S. auto market and spur a retaliatory trade war.

The Japanese automaker is on track to start shipping lithium-ion batteries later this year from a massive plant in the rural town of Liberty, N.C., that sprawls over 1,850 acres. Of that facility’s 14 production lines, 10 are dedicated to electric vehicle battery cells with the remainder going to hybrid batteries.

It will supply cells earmarked for use in the two U.S.-made EVs.

The battery factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to be operational in June and the others will be brought online through 2034, the company said. It aims for production greater than 30 gigawatt hours at full capacity, or the equivalent of 800,000 hybrid, 150,000 plug-in hybrid and 300,000 all-electric vehicle batteries.

Toyota's all-electric bZ4X soon will be renamed the bZ. (Toyota)

Total EV sales rose 7.3% in the U.S. last year to some 1.3 million vehicles, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelly Blue Book. But Toyota delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics skyrocketed.

The Japanese carmaker has been slower to jump on the EV bandwagon than most of its global rivals. It emerged as one of the biggest critics of policies designed to hasten EV adoption in the U.S. and has called on American policymakers to allow the market to dictate demand.

But Toyota is also reluctant to cede a market currently representing about 8% of U.S. sales to rivals such as General Motors Co., Tesla Inc., and Hyundai Motor Co. The company expects battery-electrics’ share of the American market to nearly double by 2030.

“BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us; They’re cannibalizing our volume,” said Ericksen. “But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

In addition to the all-electric bZ4X — which soon will be renamed the bZ — and Lexus RZ which it sells now, Toyota will add three more import EV models next year: The bZ Woodland, CH-R crossover and a version of the Lexus ES sedan.

Toyota’s factory in Georgetown, Ky. — its largest plant globally — currently manufactures some 550,000 vehicles annually, including top-selling models such as the RAV4 small SUV, Camry sedan and Lexus ES. The Camry went all-hybrid last year and the RAV4 will stop offering a gasoline-only version in its next model year. Toyota hasn’t disclosed the name of the all-electric model that will made there.

Similarly, it hasn’t provided details about the EV that will join larger models such as its Highlander SUV, Grand Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan that are made at its Princeton, Ind., factory, which produced nearly 330,000 vehicles last year.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-05/Toyota-plant-bb-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 19:07:26.044616

More: Toyota And Lexus Will Launch 15 EVs By 2027 And That’s Just The Start

First, Toyota is adding a few more electric options to its own lineup. Expect the facelifted bZ4X crossover (now named the bZ), the bZ Woodland, the C-HR, and an upcoming three-row SUV. On the Lexus side, the RZ crossover will be joined by an electric version of the new-generation ES sedan introduced last month and a larger SUV to boot.

US-Made Electric SUVs Are Coming

While many of these models will be imported, the big news is that the upcoming three-row SUVs, one from Toyota and one from Lexus, will be manufactured right here in the United States. After a brief delay, production will start in 2026 at two factories in Georgetown, Kentucky, and Princeton, Indiana. These new electric SUVs will go head-to-head with the likes of the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9, which are also targeting the growing demand for larger electric vehicles.

Toyota isn’t diving into the EV market without a plan. According to Bloomberg, the company typically adds a new model to a factory only when it’s confident it can move 100,000-150,000 units annually. While US EV adoption is expected to grow at a slower rate than anticipated, Toyota has a strategy to keep production moving. Any excess EV output from its US factories will be sent to overseas markets where demand is ramping up faster.

Cooper Ericksen, Senior Vice President, Product, BEV and Mobility Planning and Strategy at Toyota Motor North America, explained: “We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market. But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the US will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.” Of course, the company hopes that its export plans won’t be affected by a potential escalation of the tariff war.

A Long-Term Commitment

Currently, electric vehicles account for just 8% of automotive sales in the US, but Toyota expects that number to double by 2030. Ericksen pointed out, “BEVs right now aren’t incremental volume for us. They’re cannibalizing our volume. But in the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition.”

“I am grateful to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for awarding nearly $4 million to the Sunflower State,” Senator Marshall said. “This funding will help us revitalize our communities, create opportunities for growth, and protect Kansans’ health. Thanks to President Donald Trump’s leadership, the EPA is restoring American greatness by ensuring we have the cleanest air, land, and water while being good stewards of American taxpayer dollars.”

“The $267 million in Brownfield Grants will transform contaminated properties into valuable spaces for businesses and housing, creating new opportunities that strengthen local economies and directly benefit American families,” EPA Administrator Zeldin said. “EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy, Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Janet Stanek, and Mitchell County Economic Development Director Emily Benedick also joined Senator Marshall and EPA Administrator Zeldin in releasing the following statements.

“EPA Region 7 is proud to work with our partners across the state of Kansas, advancing cooperative federalism and empowering local and state partners to take the lead in revitalizing their communities,” EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy said. “This collaborative approach ensures fiscal responsibility, promotes economic development, and transforms potentially contaminated properties into clean, usable land that supports long-term growth and sustainability.”

“The Community Wide Assessment Grant for State and Tribal will help increase property values and create jobs across Kansas,” Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Janet Stanek said. “Receiving these substantial dollars to support the redevelopment of brownfields throughout the state not only benefits the environment, but it elevates communities and industries by turning underutilized and vacant properties into productive ones. This is a win for the entire state.”

“The City of Beloit is incredibly grateful and excited to receive EPA Brownfield Cleanup funding. This funding enables our community to repurpose two vacant buildings into housing, a critical need in our rural community,” Mitchell County Economic Development Director Emily Benedick said. “This grant gives us the peace of mind to know we are providing a safe environment for future housing development.”

The following organizations in Kansas have been selected to receive EPA Brownfields funding:

The City of Beloit has been selected to receive $418,620. Grant funds will be used to clean up the Kansas Industrial School Campus, located at 1720 N. Hersey Avenue. The 0.8-acre cleanup site operated as a juvenile detention center for girls and has been vacant since 2009. It is contaminated with inorganic contaminants. Grant funds will also be used to conduct community engagement activities.

The Flint Hills Regional Council has been selected to receive $1 million. The grant will be used to capitalize a revolving loan fund (RLF), from which Flint Hills Regional Council Inc. will provide up to three loans and up to two subgrants to support cleanup activities. Grant funds will also be used to establish the RLF, market the program, and support community engagement activities. RLF activities will focus on Chase, Geary, Lyon, Morris, Pottawatomie, Riley, and Wabaunsee counties, with a focus on the cities of Herington, Junction City, and Manhattan.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

While remoteness remains a barrier, EVs are a great option if you’re mostly driving around town and are looking for ways to pay less for transportation.

Alaska EV Rebates

Alaska does not currently offer a state-level EV rebate. However, as of 2025, Alaska Power and Telephone offers rebates on EV purchases:

Alaska Power and Telephone EV Rebate

If you live in one of the 40 communities served by Alaska Power and Telephone, you can claim a $500 Alaska EV rebate just for buying an EV. Any electric car or motorcycle with a battery size over 14 kWh qualifies.

Alaska EV Tax Credits

Alaska does not have a state-wide EV tax credit, but residents may qualify for federal EV tax credits like the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit for new vehicles, or the $4,000 used clean vehicle tax credit.

Additionally, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit provides a federal tax credit up to $1,000 to offset costs related to installing an EV charger at home. Businesses can claim EV charger tax credits worth up to $100,000.

Alaska EV Charger Rebates

Charging your EV at home is both affordable and convenient. To achieve the best charging speed with your residential electrical infrastructure, it is essential to install a Level 2 EV charger with the help of a qualified EV charger installation professional.

Three utility providers in Alaska offer EV charger rebates with incentives ranging from $200 to $1,000 dollars:

Alaska Power and Telephone EV Charger Rebate

The Alaska Power and Telephone EV charger rebate isn’t available to residents, but local and tribal governments can receive up to $1,000 to help cover the cost of installing a public EV charging station.

Chugach Electric Association EV Charger Rebate

As a Chugach Electric Association residential customer, you can claim a $200 rebate on Level 2 home chargers.

Kodiak Electric Association EV Charger Rebate

Kodiak Electric will credit you up to $500 for installing a residential EV charger within their service territory. Once the utility approves your project, you’ll receive a $500 rebate spread over the 12 months following the install.

EV Charging Rates in Alaska

At $0.24 per kWh, Alaska’s average residential electrical rate is slightly higher than the rest of the country. This is primarily due to the state’s highly fragmented and spread-out power grid, which covers vast areas.

For EV owners, charging at home remains cheaper than in public, and time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates can unlock savings. These plans incentivize vehicle charging during off-peak hours, making EV ownership more affordable.

Alaska Electric Light & Power Company

This utility offers a special rate for EV owners. Instead of paying the standard rate of $0.10 per kWh, you can set up a separate meter for your at-home charger and pay $0.05 per kWh.

Public EV Charging Stations in Alaska

Alaska’s public EV charging network is growing due to efforts from businesses, utility companies, and public agencies. For instance, the Alaska Energy Authority has used NEVI funds to install Level 2 chargers at public facilities in Anchorage.

How Many Public EV Charging Stations Are in Alaska?

As of May 2025, Alaska has over 60 EV charging stations including 53 Level 2 and 19 DC Fast charging stations. There are 145 public EV charging ports, 2 Tesla Supercharger stations and 12 Tesla Supercharger ports in Alaska.

The Ford BlueOval network, with around 15 locations in the Anchorage area, is another option to consider.

How Much Do Public EV Charging Stations Cost in Alaska?

Prices vary by network and location. For instance, the two DC Fast chargers owned and operated by the Grand Valley Electric Association in Fairbanks cost $0.20 per minute. If you charge at the Midas auto repair shop on East Steam Commons Avenue in Wasilla, you’ll have to pay $4 per hour.

Be sure to read our article discussing the Cost of Charging an EV at Home vs. Public Charging.

Are There Free EV Charging Stations in Alaska?

The charging station inside the East Park Garage on 7th Avenue and G Street in Anchorage and the charger at the Alaska Electric Light & Power facility on Tonsgard Court in Juneau are free to use

Where Are Public EV Charging Stations Located in Alaska?

Major cities like Anchorage and Juneau have more charging options. Generally speaking, you’ll find EV stations along the state’s Southern coast.

Visit the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center Map of EV Charging Station Locations in Alaska, which can be sorted and filtered based on public access, charger type (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast), and connector type (NACS, J1772, CCS, CHAdeMO).

Home Electrification Incentives in Alaska

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.",https://qmerit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/alaska-ev-rebates-incentives-tax-credits-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 22:07:15.039579
,EPA,2025-05-29 21:55:27+00:00,Competitive Enterprise Institute,Eight energy policies that reduce competition and increase energy prices,Daren Bakst •,,,,,https://cei.org/blog/eight-energy-policies-that-reduce-competition-and-increase-energy-prices/,"Policies that increase energy prices, such as laws that reduce competition, have effects across the entire economy, including the other markets specifically identified by the Task Force: housing, transportation, food and agriculture, and healthcare.
Below are eight policies that we listed that reduce competition and increase energy prices.
Renewable Fuel Standard.
Passed by Congress in 2005 and amended in 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard requires a certain amount of renewable fuels be blended into the transportation fuel mix each year.
These state level policies (RPSs) require that a certain portion of a state’s power come from renewable sources by a given year.","The US Department of Justice’s Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force was accepting comments from the public in part “seeking information about laws and regulations that make it more difficult for businesses to compete effectively, especially in markets that have the greatest impact on American households.” The comment period closed on May 27.

One of the identified markets was the energy market. When looking at energy-related laws and regulations, the harmful effects are not limited to the energy sector. Policies that increase energy prices, such as laws that reduce competition, have effects across the entire economy, including the other markets specifically identified by the Task Force: housing, transportation, food and agriculture, and healthcare.

My colleagues Paige Lambermont and Ben Lieberman co-authored a comment with me that we sent to the Task Force. Below are eight policies that we listed that reduce competition and increase energy prices. This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it is a good starting point.

EPA’s De Facto EV Mandate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule that would help to kill off gas-powered cars. According to the EPA, by 2032, 56 percent of new light-duty vehicles sold will be battery electric vehicles (EVs) and 13 percent will be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Less than 30 percent will be internal combustion engine vehicles. This is a direct attack on competition within the automobile industry. It would intentionally shift Americans into vehicles that are more expensive and less reliable than gas-powered vehicles.

The EPA’s Clean Power Plan 2.0. The EPA finalized a rule that would once again have the agency act as the nation’s grid manager. The agency’s goal is to shift electricity generation from reliable sources of electricity (e.g. coal and natural gas) to unreliable sources of electricity (wind and solar). This rule literally seeks to kill off power generation by coal and natural gas.

The IRA’s “Green” Subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) uses a wide range of subsidies, from loans, grants, to tax credits, to change how the nation produces and use energy. Like the Clean Power Plan 2.0, the subsidies are intended to shift the country away from reliable sources of electricity, reducing competition and driving up prices. There are IRA subsidies, which like the EPA’s de facto EV mandate would attempt to kill off gas-powered cars and get people driving EVs or out of cars altogether. The IRA is filled with harmful policies as well connected to appliances and housing.

HUD and USDA Housing Codes. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted stringent international building code provisions for all new homes qualifying for federally backed mortgages. According to the National Association of Home Builders, these provisions could add up to $31,000 to the cost of a compliant new home.

Residential Air Conditioning Rule. A 2023 Biden EPA regulation requires that all new residential air conditioning systems manufactured on or after January 1, 2025 must use certain agency-approved refrigerants deemed sufficiently climate friendly. Doing so has created a captive market for more expensive air conditioning systems. In addition, several of the compliant refrigerants used in these systems are proprietary and can only be made by the two companies holding the patents for them, and they cost many times more than the previously-used refrigerants that are now illegal in new equipment. See e.g., https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ModernizingtheEPA_v2-chap2.pdf (pp.126-128).

The Jones Act. This more than 100-year-old shipping law forbids the movement of goods between two US ports on noncompliant vessels, making it expensive and difficult for some parts of the United States to maintain reliable supplies of natural gas. The Jones Act’s requirements that vessels be US-owned,-built,-crewed, and -registered means that no LNG tankers comply with the law. Therefore, it is impossible to move significant volumes of LNG between US ports. This is particularly unfortunate for states and territories with unique geographies and makes it hard for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and New England among others to depend on this otherwise reliable fuel for power and other uses.

Renewable Fuel Standard. Passed by Congress in 2005 and amended in 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard requires a certain amount of renewable fuels be blended into the transportation fuel mix each year. This comes largely in the form of ethanol and other biofuels. The requirement is in essence a subsidy to the producers of these fuels at the expense of everyone who purchases gasoline or diesel fuel.

Renewable Portfolio Standards. These state level policies (RPSs) require that a certain portion of a state’s power come from renewable sources by a given year. They raise prices and endanger reliability. Because of the interconnected nature of the US power grid, these policies also end up having consequences for states that have not adopted RPSs because they must make up the shortfalls of states with whom they share a grid.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Energy-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:59.726665

After news that a building bought by an EV charging station company is set for demolition, parents of a school located right across the street are nervous about the future and want answers.

Demolition plans for the site of a former Kentucky Fried Chicken at 9201 Fifth Ave. were submitted to the Department of Buildings by Vincent Aiello, founder of home construction firm Monello Industries, according to Crain’s New York Business.

The outlet adds that the space was bought in 2022 by EVgo for $5.3 million.

P.S. 104 is located across the street from the site and parents are worried about children’s safety if a charging station would be so close to the school.

First Vice President of Community Education Council District 20 John Ricottone released a statement about his concern.

“First and foremost, there are currently no comprehensive studies on the long-term impact of EV charging stations on growing children, especially those in the kindergarten through fifth-grade age group,” he said. “Installing such infrastructure near an elementary school raises valid health and safety questions that remain unanswered.”

He also noted the area’s history of traffic accidents.

“The installation of an EV charging station—likely to increase vehicle traffic and distractions—could further endanger students, staff, and families during drop-off and pick-up times,” Ricottone said. “It’s not yet clear how many entry and exit points this facility would have, whether it will be operating 24/7, or what kind of security measures will be in place. All of these are critical details that must be publicly clarified before moving forward.”

He also believes that high-voltage electrical equipment requires stringent safeguards.

But with the new XRT version, Hyundai decided it wasn’t enough to impress the Whole Foods parking lot.
The Flaws (Because Every Hero Needs One) The XRT isn’t perfect.
Verdict: Hyundai’s Got Grit The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just another electric SUV.
With Tesla’s plug onboard, class-leading charge times, and just enough off-road swagger, the Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just in the game.","(TestMiles) – What happens when Hyundai raids Tesla’s charging tech, throws on some hiking boots, and dares to redefine the electric SUV? You get this: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT. It’s not just a trim. It’s a quiet revolution​, with off-road cladding.

The original Ioniq 5 already had serious street cred in the EV world. It was fast, futuristic, and fun. But with the new XRT version, Hyundai decided it wasn’t enough to impress the Whole Foods parking lot. This one wants to be seen near ski lifts and gravel roads​, and charge at Tesla Superchargers while it’s at it.

The Look: More Brawn, Less Flash

The Ioniq 5 XRT shares its bones with the standard model, but adds attitude in the form of matte black cladding, rugged-looking wheels, and a general sense that it’s not afraid of a little trail dust. It’s still not built for Moab​, let’s be clear. There’s no extra lift, no terrain modes. This is Patagonia, not Rubicon.

Still, the aesthetic works. The pixelated lighting remains​, a sharp throwback to 8-bit cool​, and the whole package is retro-modern in a way that feels intentional, not nostalgic. Hyundai didn’t chase trends. They started one.

The Plug Heard Round the World

The biggest news? The XRT is the first non-Tesla EV in the U.S. to come with the North American Charging Standard (NACS). That’s Tesla’s plug, in case you’ve missed a year of headlines. And it means Ioniq 5 owners will have access to over 15,000 Tesla Superchargers by 2025.

With one plug swap and a handshake, Hyundai solved range anxiety in a way that software updates and clever apps never could. The Ioniq 5 isn’t just playing catch-up​, it’s leapfrogging the competition.

Lounge Meets Spaceship

Inside, the XRT is everything EV cabins promise but rarely deliver. Flat floors. A slide-away center console. Space to stretch and stash your gear. It’s minimal without being stark, and comfy without screaming “luxury tax.” Think Scandinavian design with a side of sci-fi.

It’s also practical. With vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability, the Ioniq 5 can power your laptop, your blender, or even a tent full of string lights. It’s a campsite-ready power station on wheels, which is more than can be said for most SUVs still stuck on cupholders as innovation.

Performance With a Punch

Don’t be fooled by the friendly face. This thing has torque​,​ 446 pound-feet of it, to be exact. With dual motors pushing out 320 horsepower, the Ioniq 5 XRT hits 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. That’s quicker than some sports sedans, in a body that can carry dogs, groceries, and everything in between.

It’s not just fast in a straight line, either. Thanks to Hyundai’s E-GMP platform and 800-volt architecture, it charges from 10 to 80 percent in under 18 minutes. That’s a lunch break—not an overnight stay.

The Flaws (Because Every Hero Needs One)

The XRT isn’t perfect. It lacks a rear wiper, which feels like an odd omission on a vehicle made to look outdoorsy. And while the exterior screams trailhead-ready, there’s no real off-road gear under the surface. It’s more about looking adventurous than conquering the unknown.

But maybe that’s the point. Most owners won’t be rock-crawling. They’ll be hauling gear to the cabin, picking up the kids, or squeezing in a long weekend somewhere with cell signal. And for that crowd, the XRT is more than enough.

Verdict: Hyundai’s Got Grit

The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just another electric SUV. It’s a bold statement from an automaker that’s no longer content to follow the rules—or the leaders. With Tesla’s plug onboard, class-leading charge times, and just enough off-road swagger, the Ioniq 5 XRT isn’t just in the game. It’s changing.

However, once the exhaust underwent photochemical aging—a natural transformation process driven by sunlight and atmospheric oxidants—it became substantially more toxic.
According to Dr. Mathilde Delaval, first author of the study and researcher at Helmholtz Munich, these findings point to a critical shortfall in current vehicle emissions testing and regulation.
There’s a clear disconnect between how we test vehicle emissions in the lab and how those emissions behave in the real world.","A new international study led by Helmholtz Munich and the University of Rostock found that emissions from modern gasoline cars—despite meeting the currently strictest European emission standards EURO 6d—can become significantly more harmful after being released into the atmosphere. The findings, published in an open-access paper in Science Advances, challenge the assumption that filtered exhaust from EURO 6d-compliant vehicles is inherently safe.

The research focused on a gasoline vehicle equipped with a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), designed to drastically reduce primary particulate emissions. Freshly emitted exhaust showed no detectable cytotoxic effects on human lung cells. However, once the exhaust underwent photochemical aging—a natural transformation process driven by sunlight and atmospheric oxidants—it became substantially more toxic.

The aged emissions caused notable DNA damage and oxidative stress in both cancerous alveolar and normal bronchial epithelial cells. This toxicity was not only associated with newly formed particles, known as secondary organic and inorganic aerosols (SOA and SIA), but also with oxygenated volatile compounds, such as carbonyls, generated during their residence in the atmosphere.

According to Dr. Mathilde Delaval, first author of the study and researcher at Helmholtz Munich, these findings point to a critical shortfall in current vehicle emissions testing and regulation. While EURO 6d standards ensure low emissions at the tailpipe, they do not account for the chemical transformations those emissions undergo once released into the environment.

Our study shows that we are missing a big part of the picture by not considering how exhaust gases change and become more harmful after they leave the car.

—Dr. Mathilde Delaval

The results have important implications for how air quality standards are set and monitored. Current regulations focus primarily on the emissions measured directly after combustion, without factoring in how these emissions interact with sunlight and atmospheric chemicals to form new, more harmful pollutants.

There’s a clear disconnect between how we test vehicle emissions in the lab and how those emissions behave in the real world. If we ignore what happens to exhaust after it enters the atmosphere, we risk underestimating the true health impact of traffic-related air pollution.

—co-author Dr. Hendryk Czech from Helmholtz Munich and the University of Rostock

Air pollution remains a major global health issue, responsible for increased rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death. The discovery that filtered emissions from even the cleanest gasoline cars can still become toxic once airborne suggests that future regulations must evolve to address both primary and secondary pollutants.

This study was a joint effort by a multidisciplinary team of biologists, aerosol physicists, and chemists investigating the health impacts of air pollution. Led by Prof. Ralf Zimmermann, professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Rostock and head of the Joint Mass Spectrometry Group at Helmholtz Munich and the University of Rostock, the project brought together researchers from Germany, Finland, Switzerland, and Israel.

Key collaborators came from Helmholtz Munich, the University of Rostock, the University of Eastern Finland, Research Center Jülich, the Weizmann Institute of Science, the University of Basel, and the University of the Bundeswehr Munich. The work was conducted within the Helmholtz International Lab “aeroHEALTH” and supported by the EU-funded project “ULTRHAS,” with core experiments carried out at the ILMARI research facility in Kuopio, Finland, led by Prof. Olli Sippula.

Michigan is a top 10 state for clean energy jobs, leads the nation for total jobs in advanced materials and has the fastest-growing workforce for energy-efficient HVAC and renewable heating and cooling

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. — The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Community & Worker Economic Transition Office announced a public-private partnership designed to create and retain good-paying jobs, support Michigan manufacturers and strengthen the state’s position as a global leader in the energy supply chain at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually — $2 billion from DTE and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses. This historic commitment is focused on strengthening local supply chains for critical energy infrastructure, such as transformers, and next-generation technologies, including solar components and long-duration energy storage systems.

""Michigan is paving the way growing our economy and meeting our ambitious energy goals,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Today, we’re launching new resources designed to support our manufacturers and help them create and retain good-paying jobs while building strong, resilient energy supply chains right here in Michigan. This partnership will position our manufacturers to lead in the clean energy future, keeping production local and ensure that Michigan remains a hub of innovation and industry. Let’s keep working hard to make a difference and build a Michigan where everyone can thrive.”

“We know we can keep Michigan as a leader in manufacturing, while also strengthening the prosperity of everyone in our state,” said Community & Worker Economic Transition Office Director Jonathan Smith. ""Through innovative partnerships like this one between government, industry, nonprofit organizations and philanthropy we can deliver powerful lasting, impactful solutions that help our businesses, workers and communities plan for and thrive in the future.""

The State of Michigan will work closely with DTE and Consumers Energy to identify in-state suppliers, help them retool to meet the energy sector’s needs and connect them with the resources necessary to grow and compete. The partnership will reduce long lead times for critical equipment and components that currently have few or zero domestic suppliers. Having more local suppliers also means keeping prices affordable for Michigan ratepayers.

“DTE has a long history of partnering with Michigan businesses to keep our spending local, and we’re proud to build on that history by committing to spend $2 billion annually with Michigan suppliers,” said Trevor Lauer, vice chairman and group president, DTE Energy. “Focusing on keeping our spending in-state has a transformative impact on the Michigan economy, allowing businesses to grow and creating thousands of jobs, while also helping DTE to build an agile supply chain that allows us to deliver the services our customers demand and deserve.”

The partnership will also help utilities more quickly and efficiently meet their reliability and resiliency goals, putting Michigan on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“We'd love to see Michigan’s manufacturing talent and expertise build the energy equipment we need right here at home,” said Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. “Cultivating and buying from a resilient, robust energy supply chain in Michigan continues Consumers Energy’s longstanding commitment to in-state suppliers. It’s the natural next step, and the right thing for Consumers Energy, our customers and the state.”

To help manufacturers and clean energy startups retool their facilities and retain their workers to support new work coming in from utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy, the Transition Office is also launching the MI Hub for Manufacturers. With $1.5 million in support from philanthropy and a partnership with Next Street, a national small business and supplier solutions company, this dynamic, interactive online platform will connect small and mid-sized manufactures to public, private and non-profit resources. The platform will publish funding opportunities, connect businesses to expert advisors and capital products, provide on-demand digital learning tools and host partner resources that can help suppliers diversify and grow to enter new supply chains.

“We are proud to partner with the State of Michigan to equip manufacturers with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive, grow, and lead in an evolving industrial landscape,” said CEO of Next Street, Charisse Conanan Johnson. “The MI Hub for Manufacturers is a powerful example of public-private partnership — bringing together government, philanthropy, industry, and community organizations to deliver real value to small and mid-sized businesses. Equitable economic growth starts by unlocking the full potential of our local supply chains, and Michigan is setting the standard for what that looks like.”

The 2024 Clean Jobs America Report stated that clean energy businesses in Michigan added more than 5,200 workers and now employ 127,690 Michiganders. According to Clean Jobs Midwest and Climate Power, the state is projected to add 167,000 clean energy jobs over the next decade, continuing Michigan’s leadership as the no. 1 state in the nation for IRA-funded projects that have resulted in more than $25B in new investments and over 21,400 new jobs across the state.

“The Community and Worker Economic Transition Office will help ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy,” Glenn Stevens Jr., Executive Director, MichAuto at the Detroit Regional Chamber. “This work resonates strongly with MichAuto's mission to ensure the state's signature automotive and mobility industry, Michigan, and its workers continue to lead the world in automotive manufacturing and innovation well into the future.”",https://www.michigan.gov/leo/-/media/Project/Websites/leo/Images/Executive1/LEO_WebIMG/Someone-working-on-their-computer.jpg?rev=4a01d7cb73304829b4bbfbd5b080a586&hash=828DA554C5E1A9686253BB3B6A1EB500,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:31.492213

The White House and corresponding agencies did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment on the matter.","A group of 22 young Americans sued the Trump administration over executive orders the plaintiffs say will promote climate change.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Montana and challenges executive orders 14156, 14154 and 14261, which declare a “National Energy Emergency.” The Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NASA are named as defendants in the suit.

“[President] Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” plaintiff Eva Lighthiser said.

“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution,” she added.

Lighthiser is joined by youth plaintiffs from Montana, along with others from Hawaii, Oregon, California and Florida.

They’ve alleged that the president’s executive orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty by “deliberately worsening” climate pollution that threatens their health and futures.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has issued orders aimed at expediting energy and infrastructure projects; promoting the use of coal, critical minerals and fossil fuels; and sunsetting EPA regulations that prevent mining and offshore drilling.

The White House and corresponding agencies did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment on the matter.

Nevertheless, it’s a sharp reversal of trends E2 tracked in the sector over the previous three years, when $127.7 billion in new clean energy project announcements outpaced cancellations at a rate of nearly 50-to-1.
Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported.
Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter.
And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.","Businesses have cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion of investments in U.S. clean energy projects so far this year, reflecting their uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid President Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat, industry analysts reported Thursday.

The sector still is showing resilience—at least $4.2 billion in new renewable energy, grid, electric vehicle and battery projects were announced over the same time period, from January through April, according to the tracking report by the nonprofit group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2, and its research partner, Atlas Public Policy.

Some 10,000 jobs are expected to be created by these newly announced projects—including an electric truck assembly plant that the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto said it would site in Warsaw, Indiana. That’s equal to the estimated number of job losses from all the clean energy projects that have been abandoned so far this year. Nevertheless, it’s a sharp reversal of trends E2 tracked in the sector over the previous three years, when $127.7 billion in new clean energy project announcements outpaced cancellations at a rate of nearly 50-to-1.

Officials at E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders and investors, said it was an ominous sign as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the House-passed tax and spending cut package that would eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director for E2. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the report.

The biggest of the cancellations that E2 tracked came in April. The United Auto Workers announced that Stellantis would not go forward with a $3.2 billion battery plant it planned to add to a giant shuttered assembly facility it is reopening in Belvidere, Illinois. And global energy giant RWE announced it was shuttering its U.S. offshore wind operations “for the time being” due to “the political environment” in the United States. RWE had invested $1.1 billion to develop wind projects offshore of New York, Louisiana and California.

While E2 tracks public announcements of new projects and cancellations, other efforts at tracking what’s happening in the clean energy sector provide a more detailed picture—and in some senses, a more optimistic one.

The Clean Investment Monitor, a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the consulting firm Rhodium Group, tracks actual capital spending in the quarter of all projects that have broken ground, and also includes investment in decarbonization projects at energy and industrial plants as well as consumer spending—for example, on EVs, rooftop solar and efficiency upgrades. For the first quarter of 2025, Clean Investment Monitor reported $67.3 billion in spending, a 6.9 percent increase from the same period in 2024. However, it was a 3.8 percent falloff from the previous quarter, and the second consecutive quarterly decline after an unbroken record of quarterly expansion that began in 2021.

Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported. Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter. And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.

The American Clean Power Association (ACPA), which tracks utility-scale electricity projects, also put out its first quarter report Thursday, showing that developers installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity, marking the second-strongest start to a year on record. (The strongest start on record was 2024, when 8 gigawatts came on line.) That brings total utility-scale clean power capacity to more than 320 gigawatts, which the association estimates is enough to power nearly 80 million U.S. homes. Of course, that electricity is not only powering homes but also businesses, where power demand is rising sharply due to data centers.

It was a record-setting quarter for battery storage capacity, which surpassed 30 gigawatts, a 65 percent increase from last year. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity in just one quarter, with the help of a big system owned by the energy company AES that opened in April at the site of a former coal power plant.

Texas continued to lead the nation in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity, with its total clean energy portfolio reaching more than 80 gigawatts, a 20 percent increase from a year ago, ACPA said. In all, eight of the top 10 states for clean power additions in the quarter voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election.

The association also saw continuing growth in the project development pipeline, with a 12 percent year-over-year increase in projects under construction or in the advanced stages of development. If all are built, it would add up to $328 billion in investment, said the group’s CEO, Jason Grumet.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale,” he said, while echoing E2’s concerns about the retreat from federal support for the sector in Washington.

“With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” Grumet said. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1470383347-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:48.464147

If that were to happen, it would harm the business case in Marshall, said Bill Ford.
Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.
Ford made his remarks after an on-stage interview alongside his daughter and Ford board member Alexandra Ford English at the Mackinac Policy Conference.
Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, is the automaker’s fourth leader from the family in its more than 120-year existence.","The executive chairman of Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that its $2.5 billion electric vehicle battery factory in Marshall would be “in peril” if it loses production tax credits as called for in proposed U.S. House legislation.

The bill, which still must be reconciled by the Senate, could make the plant ineligible for a key manufacturing subsidy due to its ties to Chinese battery company CATL. If that were to happen, it would harm the business case in Marshall, said Bill Ford.

“We have built the business case on Marshall around that,” the chairman told reporters after a panel discussion at the Mackinac Policy Conference. “My point is politicians can agree or disagree whether those kind of things are desirable, and that’s fine. But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment, because that to me is just a question of fairness, and that’s unfair.”

The company likely will press hard to change the language of the final bill to ensure the factory, set to launch production next year, makes it to the finish line. While some lawmakers are seeking to keep tax credits away form “foreign entities of concern,” as CATL is labeled in the proposed bill, the factory in Marshall would create 1,700 jobs and serve as an economic catalyst, the automaker and proponents has argued.

Bill Ford said he is not sure whether the tax credits for the Marshall plant will ultimately be protected.

“I don’t know the likelihood, but I do know that if it goes away, it puts in peril the plant and the jobs in Michigan,” he said.

Also Thursday, Ford was joined by more than 100 Marshall area business owners and leaders who publicized a letter to Michigan’s congressional delegation urging the preservation of the tax credit.

“As Congress continues to work through the budget reconciliation process, we ask that you consider how important the Production Tax Credit is to potential economic growth for families and businesses across the Calhoun County region,” the letter reads.

Ford made his remarks after an on-stage interview alongside his daughter and Ford board member Alexandra Ford English at the Mackinac Policy Conference. The discussion, moderated by former TV anchor Christy McDonald, centered on the father-daughter dynamics in one of America’s most famous family businesses.

Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, is the automaker’s fourth leader from the family in its more than 120-year existence. English was elected to the automaker’s influential board of directors in 2021, along with her cousin Henry Ford III, son of Edsel B. Ford II, a former board member and director at the company.

English began her career in retail, working at Gap Inc. and Tory Burch. Even if she had wanted to jump straight from college to the automaker, her father wouldn’t have allowed it. Bill Ford’s rule is that family members cannot go right into the business.

“We cannot be a family employment agency,” Ford said. “We want to make sure the young people that come into our company are incredibly well qualified and motivated.”

English served as an employee at the automaker from 2017 until June 2022, running operations for Ford’s Autonomous Vehicle LLC before the company shut down efforts to develop a fully autonomous vehicle.

She said the inspiration to work for the automaker started when her father would come home from work and talk to his family about his day. The family values and those of the company are one in the same, she said, making it a seamless cultural fit working for the automaker.

“Whenever he spoke about employees, it was always with deep respect, and that leaves an impression,” English said. “I don’t remember anything other than those values. It’s all we know.”

Ford said one characteristic English is never afraid to bring to the table – over family dinner or in the boardroom – is brutal honesty. That’s important, the chairman said, because most others aren’t willing to be that blunt with the boss.

“She’s always the one that will sit me down and tell me what I don’t want to hear,” he said. “Not many people in life will do that. She’s been the brave one.”

On the topic of constantly shifting federal policy under President Donald Trump, the chairman said his company, expecting to take a $1.5 billion tariff hit this year, speaks with the White House on a near daily basis. Ford, which boasts the most U.S.-based vehicle production among its domestic counterparts, hopes the Trump administration and lawmakers recognize that when devising policy that could impact its Marshall factory and broader production plans.

The company’s decision to build more in the U.S. amounts to a $2,000 per vehicle “penalty” compared to customers more exposed to foreign manufacturing, the chairman said.

Ford Says Michigan Battery Plant at Risk If Tax Credits Are Cut Back to video

Article content

The plant in Marshall, Michigan — and the 1,700 workers that Ford plans to employ there — would be “imperiled” if US lawmakers move to eliminate tax credits that support battery producers as part of a broader tax plan moving through congress, Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said Thursday during remarks at the Mackinac Policy Conference at Michigan’s Mackinac Island.

“It’s not fair to change policy after all the expenditures have been made,” Ford said. “The production tax credit seems to be up for grabs.”

Article content

After the event, Ford told reporters that “nothing needs to change” about the production tax credit because “we have built the business case on Marshall around that.”

Article content

President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill included several tax credits designed to help establish an EV supply chain and support consumer demand for plug-in cars.

Article content

Republican lawmakers are moving to unwind those policies. In addition to phasing out a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, the House-passed bill would end a manufacturing credit for battery makers after 2031. It would also mandate strict restrictions against the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts say could effectively render it useless.

Article content

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment because that to me is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”

Article content

The legislative risks mark the latest potential hurdle for a plant Ford announced in 2023 that was originally intended to produce enough batteries for 400,000 EVs, part of an earlier ambitious plan to electrify its lineup. The automaker later reduced that target to power about 230,000 EVs as consumer demand for the technology faltered.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/775940258.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:27.114771

​​​​​​​Story 8: Peter Biello: The Columbus City Council voted this week to fire City Manager Isaiah Hugley, just seven months from his retirement.","Peter Biello: Welcome to the Georgia Today podcast. Here, we feature the latest reports from the GPB News team. On today's episode, Georgia loses billions of dollars in clean energy investments. SNAP recipients say they've lost $23 million to theft, and the Columbus City Council this week fired its long-serving city manager, Isaiah Hugley. His lawyer is arguing —

Chuck Williams: The council went through this termination and the statements are trying to discredit Mr. Hugley in advance of a political campaign.

Peter Biello: Today is Thursday, May 29. I'm Peter Biello, and this is Georgia Today.

Story 1:

Peter Biello: Metro Atlanta congressman Hank Johnson heard from frustrated constituents at a packed town hall meeting last night. The Democrat is one of the few federal lawmakers in Georgia holding in-person public meetings as they've grown more contentious. GPB's Sarah Kallis reports.

Sarah Kallis: Constituents at the town hall pressed Johnson on why Democrats in Congress are not doing more to block Trump's agenda. He says he understands the frustration, but it is up to the people now to vote Democrats back into the majority.

Hank Johnson: No point in blaming Democrats for us being in this situation where our democracy is threatened, our economy is threatened, our public health, our national security being threatened. There's no point in pointing fingers at each other about that. We must confront the threat to our existence that is posed by Donald Trump.

Sarah Kallis: Republicans outnumbered Democrats in both the U.S. House and Senate. The next time that could change could be the 2026 midterm elections. For GPB News, I'm Sarah Kallis in Gwinnett County.

Story 2:

Peter Biello: The legacy of the late congressman John Lewis will be celebrated in Atlanta tonight. The John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation is hosting its annual Good Trouble Gala for the first time in the city the couple called home. Dietra Austin Everson is the Foundation's president and CEO.

Dietra Austin Everson: Most people may not know that Congressman Lewis established the foundation here in Atlanta, Ga. And so this is home for Congressman Lewis's life and legacy. And it is home for the John and Lillian Miles Lewis foundation.

Peter Biello: This year's honorees include Smithsonian secretary Lonnie Bunch and Atlanta Trailblazer Billie Suber Aaron, widow of baseball great Hank Aaron.

Story 3:

Peter Biello: Wildlife conservationists with the Jekyll Island Authority have launched two online maps designed to share real-time turtle data with the public. GPB's Benjamin Payne has more.

Benjamin Payne: One of the trackers shows loggerhead sea turtle nesting hotspots along the beaches of Jekyll Island. The other map focuses on a different species of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, pinpointing individual turtle sightings along the Jekyll Island causeway, where they often get hit by cars. Joseph Colbert is a biologist with the Jekyll Island Authority.

Joseph Colbert: Every time something is collected out in the field, it automatically updates on that dashboard. So it's really cool technology and data.

Benjamin Payne: More than 250 diamondback terrapins have been found so far this year along the Jekyll Island Causeway with about two-thirds of them saved, and the island has recorded about 40 sea turtle nests. For GPB News, I'm Benjamin Payne.

Story 4:

Peter Biello: More than $3 billion in clean energy investments in Georgia have been canceled or delayed this year. That's according to an analysis released today by the national nonpartisan business group E2. The Georgia number represents about 1,300 jobs lost in about a quarter of all the clean energy investments canceled this year across the country. They include four Georgia projects in Bullock, Coweta, Stevens, and Richmond counties. Cancellations have come as President Donald Trump's pending tax and spending bill raises fears over the future of American battery, electric vehicle, and solar and wind energy development.

​​​​​​​Story 5:

Peter Biello: Georgians receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits have reported more than $23 million in stolen benefits so far this year. Numbers from the Georgia Department of Human Services show the size of a security problem hitting food aid recipients through their EBT cards. Many of the victims say they get little to no help trying to get the money back. DHS says it investigates every report and is working with law enforcement.

​​​​​​​Story 6:

Peter Biello: State regulators have approved the proposed merger between Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare and Warner Robbins-based Houston Health Care. The two systems said yesterday the OK from the Georgia Attorney General's office means the merger is set to become official on June 1.

​​​​​​​Story 7:

Peter Biello: The University of West Georgia is getting a new president. The Board of Regents yesterday named Mike Johnson the sole finalist to lead the school based in Carrollton. Johnson currently serves as chief of staff at the University of Houston.

​​​​​​​Story 8:

Peter Biello: The Columbus City Council voted this week to fire City Manager Isaiah Hugley, just seven months from his retirement. This comes after Hugley threatened legal action against several members of the council. Chuck Williams, a reporter for WRBL News 3 in Columbus, has been following this story and joins me from his newsroom. Welcome to the program.

Chuck Williams: Good to be with you, Peter; I hope things are going well up your way.

Peter Biello: Thank you very much. They are. Appreciate that. So first of all tell us about this firing; did the city council members who voted for determination elaborate on the reason why?

Chuck Williams: Uh, they did. They presented Mr. Hugley, who has been the city manager in Columbus, Ga., for 20 years — two decades — the reason they gave in a notice of termination. And I'll just read it. It makes more sense to do it that way. ""Pursuant to your employment agreement, this letter serves as formal written notice of the grounds of your termination. Over the past several months, departments under your direct supervision, including animal control and finance, have experienced ongoing operational failures and lapses in oversight, some of which have resulted in law enforcement scrutiny, in certain instances, criminal investigation. These investigations have resulted in great expense to the city and its taxpayers."" So that's why they say he was terminated.

Peter Biello: So a few things having to do with actual problems. But can you tell us a little bit about one of those problems they mentioned and — and explain why that might really warrant a firing.

Chuck Williams: We had some issues within animal control last year. Several people who worked there were investigated by Columbus Police and were arrested and charged with a variety of charges. It had to do with treatment of some of the animals in the facility. And then our finance department has been under scrutiny for almost two years now. A audit came back with a lot of issues and potential missing money. Troutman Pepper, out of Atlanta, was hired. A guy named Charles Peeler — Charlie Peeler was a former U.S. Attorney — he came in here, did an extensive investigation, was hired by city council to look at it. He found issues, he found some mismanagement, but he found nothing that rose to the level of criminal charges.

Peter Biello: In the context, as I mentioned, was Hugley's threats to sue council members for comments that they made. What did they say that upset Hugley?

Chuck Williams: They involved a 2022 federal grant that was part of the American Recovery Act that was given to Carolyn Hugley, a state farm agent who was the wife of Isaiah Hugley. Carolyn Hugly is a name that may be familiar to some people. She is a state representative from Columbus. She is also the minority leader in the Georgia House and was recently elected that post last year. The grant was administered through the city and the facts that have come out are when that grant crossed the city manager's desk he immediately sought advice from the city attorney informed the mayor and then the deputy city attorney handled that and he removed himself from the process. And as he did that, some counselors have questioned that he should have told counsel, according to our charter, and he did not. And it became a fight.

Peter Biello: I see. And the city council did not cite that as the reason for his termination, but that fight is a known part of the story here.

Chuck Williams: Interestingly, it is not in the termination letter. And it's termination in name only, quite frankly, because he had announced he would retire at the end of the year. As part of this termination notice, the last paragraph: ""council will continue to pay your regular salary along with existing benefits, including health insurance, life insurance, and pension accrual through the announced retirement date of December 31, 2025.""

Peter Biello: What's next for Isaiah Hugley? Is there any sense of what's in the future for him?

Chuck Williams: This is a fluid situation. And one of the things that is happening out of this is there is speculation that Mr. Hugley will run for mayor in the 2026 election. And his attorney claims that there's a fear of him running for the mayor's office and they are trying — the council, with — through this termination and the statements are trying to discredit Mr. Hughley in advance of a political campaign. The counselors, the seven counselors that voted to terminate him — and it was a 7-3 vote — have only legal advice or not talking about what they did. They're letting the termination notice stand for itself.

Peter Biello: Chuck Williams, a reporter for WRBL News 3 in Columbus, thank you so much for speaking with me about this.

Chuck Williams: Thank you very much, Peter, for having me. I hope you have a great weekend or week or whatever we're looking at right now.

Peter Biello: Thanks, you too. Appreciate it.

Peter Biello: A metro Atlanta student is among nine competitors to make it to the finals of the Scripps National Spelling Bee. 11-year-old fifth-grader Sarv Dharavan will compete tonight to become the nation's top speller. Good luck, Sarv.

To begin, Hall acknowledged that both dealers and consumers are navigating an uncertain economy, made more volatile by ongoing tariff discussions and policy shifts.

“No matter what happens [in the economy], we learn to turn nothing into something positive.” – Don Hall","As economic uncertainty, policy shifts, and global competition create turmoil in the auto industry, Don Hall, President and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association (VADA), says optimism and leadership are more important than ever. On the latest episode of Inside Automotive, Hall shares his insights on staying resilient, capitalizing on evolving consumer preferences, and reinforcing the strength of the franchise system.

To begin, Hall acknowledged that both dealers and consumers are navigating an uncertain economy, made more volatile by ongoing tariff discussions and policy shifts. “Every day, when it comes to tariffs, we’re hearing something different,” he said, emphasizing that dealership leaders must stay focused and inspire their teams. However, despite external noise, Hall maintains that “we’re still selling cars and trucks”—the real question is whether dealers are claiming their fair share of the market.

According to Hall, he urges dealers to reconnect with former customers, work harder, and embrace evolving customer expectations. Stating, “It’s about the customer. It’s about the customer buying experience.” He then adds, “Let’s be long-term thinkers.”

Shifting to the Virginia market, Hall noted that plug-in hybrid sales are rising, Tesla sales are declining, and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are seeing renewed strength, thanks in part to the state no longer being governed by California’s CARB regulations. Meanwhile, OEMs like Toyota are leading the hybrid charge, with Hall praising the versatility of EVs and hybrids, saying they offer consumers more choice and less range anxiety.

Additionally, Hall addressed the potential influx of Chinese vehicles following a recent deal struck by President Trump, which has OEMs like BYD eyeing U.S. entry. Hall cautioned that these manufacturers must respect the U.S. franchise dealer system, which has been the backbone of the auto industry for over 100 years. “We’ve got plenty of dealers nationwide ready and willing to partner with whomever,” he said.

When asked what OEM leaders need to better understand, Hall highlights a lack of familiarity with dealership operations. Having met with nine different OEM heads during his career, he noted that many come from engineering backgrounds and don’t fully grasp the role associations like VADA play, or the value that franchised dealers bring to the table.

It is important to note that Hall called on dealers to also share positive anecdotes to reevaluate the industry’s image.

In conclusion, Hall shares his outlook for the remainder of 2025: “Car dealers are eternal optimists.” With the stock market up and dealer sentiment positive, he reiterates that a strong customer experience and staff culture will carry the industry forward.

ST. ALBANS, Vt., May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- PurposeEnergy, a leading provider of organic waste-to-renewable energy solutions, proudly announces the Grand Opening of its state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion facility in St. Albans, Vermont. Construction began in May 2023, and the facility began exporting electricity to the Vermont grid in December 2024. This milestone marks PurposeEnergy's first project fully funded by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners (Quinbrook) following the firm's acquisition of PurposeEnergy in April 2023.

PurposeEnergy and Ben & Jerry's signed a long-term feedstock agreement in 2021, laying the groundwork for the St. Albans facility, which converts high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products into renewable energy and clean water. Ben & Jerry's sends production waste streams via a dedicated pipeline directly to the facility.

Additional feedstocks from regional producers are transported by Casella, Wind River Environmental, Evergreen Services, and Carmichael Trucking—helping to centralize food waste management and expand the facility's positive environmental impact.

""This project strengthens Ben & Jerry's commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,"" said Ben & Jerry's Global Sustainability Manager Jenna Evans. ""It will reduce Vermont's road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease Phosphorous pollution.""

PurposeEnergy-St. Albans was built on land purchased from Franklin County Industrial Development Corporation and is expected to generate 8,750,000 kWh annually of renewable electricity exported to the Vermont grid under the state's Standard Offer program, which supports the deployment of small-scale renewable generation. Simultaneously, the facility recovers up to 45,000 million Btu annually of renewable thermal energy used to heat the digester and support facility operations.

""This facility represents a major step forward in sustainable infrastructure for food manufacturing in Vermont,"" said Erik Lallum, Chief Development Officer of PurposeEnergy. ""It's a model of industrial symbiosis—turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies.""

The presence of PurposeEnergy's industrial-scale waste treatment facility can support further food manufacturing investment and economic growth in the St. Albans Industrial Park and surrounding region by offering an on-site, sustainable solution for waste management and renewable energy recovery.

The Grand Opening marks the beginning of a new chapter in Vermont's clean energy and food manufacturing landscape, uniting public and private stakeholders in the shared mission of building a more sustainable future.

,EPA,2025-05-29 21:01:15+00:00,Michigan Public,Gelman site's future is unclear as Trump proposes EPA cuts - Michigan Public,"Elinor Epperson, www.michiganpublic.org, elinor-epperson",,,,,https://www.michiganpublic.org/environment-climate-change/2025-05-29/gelman-sites-future-is-unclear-as-trump-proposes-epa-cuts,"Locals have been pushing for more aggressive solutions to the Gelman plume since a University of Michigan graduate student discovered it in 1984.

But Superfund sites often take decades to remediate, and several of those sites were removed thanks to work done during previous administrations.
EGLE’s Chris Svoboda has been involved with the Gelman site for about two years.
Citizens usually get involved in a Superfund site after it has been added to the National Priorities List, not before, he said.","Locals have been pushing for more aggressive solutions to the Gelman plume since a University of Michigan graduate student discovered it in 1984.

But Gelman is not required to clean up the plume. Instead, the state and Gelman manage the contamination through a decades-old legal agreement. Locals don’t have any direct input in what that looks like.

Advocates hoped that intervention from the U.S. EPA would bring the change they had been fighting for. But the agency’s future under Trump’s second administration is unclear.

After decades of trying to push for change from below, local officials and advocates want to leapfrog the state of Michigan and have the federal government take over management of the Gelman site of 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination on Ann Arbor's west side and Scio Township. But the Trump administration has been making changes to the Environmental Protection Agency that have advocates worried.

Washtenaw County Commissioner Yousef Rabhi is one of those advocates. He said the plume has been an important part of his career.

“I have seen government work for the people when it comes to this issue,” he said. “And I've seen government not work for the people when it comes to this issue.”

Pushing state officials for more aggressive cleanup has often been frustrating, said Kathy Knol, a trustee for Scio Township, where the plume originated.

“I feel I have a voice now, but it's taken years to get to this point,” she said. Knol has been a member of the township board since 2016.

She’s their contact for the Gelman plume, which originated at 600 S. Wagner Road just within the township’s boundaries. Knol has seen how local attempts to remediate the contamination have gained momentum — and stopped dead in their tracks.

Rabhi and Knol have spent the last year waiting for the EPA to announce whether the Gelman site will be added to the federal Superfund program. A decision was due this spring, but they’re still waiting.

The EPA is a better choice for a full cleanup because other remediation efforts have been “hamstrung” by the 1992 legal agreement between Gelman and the state, Rabhi said.

Local officials and advocates have little say in that agreement, which is supposed to hold Gelman accountable. The consent judgment — a court-supervised agreement reached to resolve a civil suit — represents a veritable brick wall for locals who feel the state isn’t adequately protecting their health.

A low trust factor

The agreement is the result of the state’s 1988 lawsuit against Gelman. It has endured for over three decades, through four amendments and three cleanup criteria changes.

It requires Gelman to manage the spread of dioxane in cooperation with the state’s environmental regulators. That includes pumping and treating groundwater to levels below 7.2 parts per billion (ppb), the state’s cleanup criterion for dioxane. But the company assumed no liability for the contamination.

The agreement serves as the agency’s enforcement tool against Gelman, said Chris Svoboda, the site’s project manager with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“We use that to keep [Gelman] in compliance,” he said. The consent judgment lays out Gelman’s responsibilities in great detail.

But a consent judgment limits the state’s regulatory and enforcement powers, said Andy Buchsbaum, an environmental law lecturer at the University of Michigan.

“The challenge with the consent judgment is it takes both parties to consent,” he said. “So you wind up with actions that may not be as protective as you'd want to see.”

As an equal party in negotiations, it’s harder for the state to compel Gelman to do something it doesn’t want to do.

For example, locals asked for more monitoring to track the plume in 2024, including testing more residential wells that aren’t officially part of the plume. The state declined to push for more funds from Gelman.

“We are in a stage where I think we have good cooperation with Gelman and their side,” Svoboda said. “And that has not always been the case. And I think that from the state’s perspective, it's a good thing to have this cooperative, collaborative relationship. EGLE making legal overtures like 'you need to pay more,' I don't necessarily know would be that conducive to keeping that relationship cooperative.""

From a resident’s perspective, that kind of agreement is hard to trust, Buchsbaum said.

“It'd be very difficult for anybody who's on the ground to trust an agreement agreed to by the perpetrator,” he said. “That doesn't mean necessarily it's a bad agreement, but it's just the trust factor would be very difficult to get unless you're part of the process.”

The result is an agreement that was never intended to clean up the contamination — just to contain it. That’s the main source of tension between advocates and state regulators, Svoboda said.

“We [EGLE] want to make sure people aren't exposed and people aren't harmed,” he said. “But unfortunately, the goal is not to completely remediate the aquifer.”

EGLE is following the consent judgment and doing its job, Svoboda said. He said that’s enough to protect the health of the community and the environment.

Rabhi and Knol don’t see it that way.

“They're arguing they are meeting our current requirements in Michigan, which is correct,” Knol said. “But it could be so much better.”

Rabhi was a bit more blunt.

“I would not consider that what they have been doing is actually protecting human health,” he said. But that’s because state regulators don’t have the tools they need to do it, he said.

“Because of the way that our state laws are structured, even our state agencies are not well equipped to actually protect the public on these issues,” he said.

But for advocates, that’s not enough. That’s why several local governments attempted to intervene in the latest round of negotiations between the state and Gelman.

But Gelman argued that the intervenors had no legal standing in negotiations and insisted that the process remain between the company and the state.

After several years of back and forth, an appellate court judge agreed. In 2022, the court ruled that the intervenors weren’t eligible to participate in that round of negotiations. The state and Gelman wrapped up the new consent judgment in spring of 2023 — without local input.

“It's often so important for the residents who are most affected to be part of whatever negotiations occur between the state and the perpetrator,” Buchsbaum said. “And that usually does not happen.”

“It is absurd to not stop the plume.”

At this point, Knol and Rabhi feel they’ll have better success with the federal government.

“I think many people believe that the best potential outcome we can get for this spreading contamination will come through [the Environmental Protection Agency],” Knol said.

Rabhi advocates for local officials to continue pushing for more action while appealing to federal regulators. But EPA intervention is preferable to the state’s current involvement, he said.

“The only way to take the chemicals out of the ground is to get the EPA involved, because [the state] has basically no ability to do it legally,” he said.

That’s been whistleblower Dan Bicknell’s solution for years.

“Gelman has not been managing the plume properly,” he said. “They've allowed the plume to expand into residential wells and they have no proper equipment to halt the plume and restore the aquifer to drinking water criteria.”

Bicknell discovered the contamination in 1984 and petitioned the county to test private wells near the Gelman site in 1985. A county official said at the time that Bicknell’s push for more testing was the only reason officials looked into the full extent of the contamination. Bicknell has stayed involved ever since.

“It is absurd to not stop the plume,” he said. Gelman is depriving the city of a clean water source by not cleaning it up, he said.

“You have a proper source of water in this pristine aquifer. You shouldn't allow it to be degraded,” he said. “You should allow it to be used in the future.”

The city currently relies heavily on Barton Pond, an impoundment of the Huron River, for drinking water. That’s already been polluted with PFAS, which the city has spent millions to filter out. Lack of clean groundwater increases costs for city residents and makes it harder for the city to provide clean drinking water, Rabhi said.

The plume hasn’t hit the pond, but the city has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars preparing for that possibility. Ann Arbor Water spent $200,000 to install additional monitoring wells and $50,000 on a facility plan study on dioxane. Quarterly testing of the pond for dioxane costs about $20,000 yearly, according to the city.

The EPA could remediate the aquifer back to usable condition, Bicknell said.

Superfund bound?

In March 2024, the EPA proposed adding the Gelman site to the National Priorities List, colloquially known as “Superfund.” The program identifies and remediates severely contaminated properties across the country. Federal law puts legal accountability for costs and cleanup on any party potentially responsible for contamination at the site. If no involved party is financially solvent, the federal government pays for it.

That’s not uncommon. Contaminated sites often find their way onto the list because they are “orphaned,” meaning the party or parties that owned the site no longer exist.

Gelman has been purchased by larger corporations twice in the past 30 years. Pall Life Sciences, now Pall Corporation, bought Gelman in 1997. Danaher, a multi-billion dollar life sciences corporation, bought Pall in 2015. None of the three companies responded to repeated requests for comment over email, phone and mail.

Gelman has argued that full cleanup of the aquifer isn’t feasible. The company maintains that the plume does not pose a threat to public health — because residents aren’t allowed to use the contaminated groundwater.

The EPA has assessed the Gelman site twice before, in 1986 and 2017. After the 2017 assessment, the EPA told local officials that the site was eligible for Superfund status. But to move forward, the EPA needs state buy-in.

Then-Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, declined to pursue EPA intervention. In 2021, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, requested the site be placed on the National Priorities List.

That’s why the site is finally being considered, said Erica Aultz, the National Priorities List coordinator for the site.

“The state of Michigan had decided that they feel that the EPA and their authorities [were] the best tool to address the contamination at this site,” she said. “It will not proceed to this point [of listing] without state support.”

Each site proposed for the list has a 90-day public comment period. That period closed in May 2024 for the Gelman site.

Since then, the EPA has been reviewing over 150 comments left by residents, local officials, advocacy groups and Gelman itself on the agency’s proposal to add the site to the list. The agency expected to issue a response to comments and a decision this spring, Aultz said.

But the EPA may have delayed Superfund listing decisions. That’s according to Joshua Mosher, Assistant Director of the Remediation and Redevelopment division at EGLE. EPA staff told him all listing decisions for spring 2024 had been delayed until the fall, he said at the March 2025 meeting of the Coalition for Action on Remediation of Dioxane (CARD).

“It’s nothing specific with Gelman, it’s the whole process,” he said at the meeting. “It’s all we know right now; any additions to the NPL are delayed right now.”

EGLE confirmed Mosher’s source was the EPA itself. But when we reached out to EPA to confirm, an agency spokesperson said they “[do] not have any information about a possible delay.”

Even if the site is listed, it’s unclear how the EPA will address advocates’ concerns. Spokespeople for the EPA could not make promises about how the program would address specific sites, including the plume.

And each stage of the National Priorities process can take years. Bicknell pointed out that’s in the cards for the Gelman plume regardless of who is managing the site.

“This is a long journey to get to a proper cleanup,” he said.

What would happen to the consent judgment?

Adding the site to the Superfund list would transfer enforcement responsibilities to the federal government. Advocates hope that stronger liability provisions in federal law would force Gelman to do more about the plume.

But it is unclear whether that would definitively override the consent judgment currently governing the site.

Bicknell is sure it would. Buchsbaum, the environmental lawyer, isn’t so sure. And neither are the state nor the EPA.

When asked what effect EPA intervention would have on the consent judgment, spokespeople for the EPA responded with the same answer that was found on the EPA’s FAQ for the site: “If the Gelman Sciences, Inc. site is listed on the [National Priorities List, NPL], at that time, EPA would become the lead enforcement agency and would coordinate with Michigan on how to smoothly transition the enforcement lead to EPA.”

That FAQ also said: “EPA has not taken a position on the specific terms of the consent judgment and cannot dictate its terms. If EPA pursues listing the site on the NPL, EPA will not require that the state court litigation end or the terms of the consent judgment be changed.”

The FAQ was removed in February 2025.

EGLE, the state’s environmental department, pointed to the state attorney general’s office, which works with Gelman to interpret and negotiate the consent judgment. The attorney general’s office declined to answer questions about the consent judgment’s future under the EPA. The office then pointed us back to EGLE and the EPA.

If the site is approved, anyone who commented on the listing proposal has 90 days to legally contest the EPA’s decision, Aultz said at the June 2024 coalition meeting. That includes Gelman. But that wouldn’t stop the process from moving forward, the EPA confirmed.

EPA under Trump's second term

It’s also unclear how the Superfund program as a whole will fare under a second Trump presidency. Advocates worry the delay is the result of changing priorities at the agency.

The President is committed to cleaning up polluted sites, the EPA said in a statement in February. A spokesperson cited the number of sites deleted from the Superfund list during Trump’s first term.

Deleting a site from the list is the penultimate stage of the Superfund process, when the agency determines if the site is safe enough for reuse.

But Superfund sites often take decades to remediate, and several of those sites were removed thanks to work done during previous administrations. And previous administrations didn’t measure success by counting deletions.

While the EPA under then-Trump appointee Scott Pruitt did push for cleanup at some sites, those tended to be sites ideal for redevelopment, rather than the most toxic sites.

And by the end of Trump’s first term, Superfund sites languished due to lack of funding, creating the largest backlog of sites ready for cleanup but without funding in 15 years. Trump then proposed cutting the EPA’s funding by 26% in 2020.

Project 2025 suggests the EPA should focus on “short-term cleanups” and prioritize “economic opportunities” that remediation could bring. The plan also suggests revisiting emerging contaminants like PFAS and allowing potentially responsible parties to conduct their own five-year reviews of Superfund cleanups.

Plus, there’s concern the administration could cut staff at the Region 5 office, which oversees Michigan’s Superfund sites. In late February, Trump said the EPA would be cutting 65% of its staff. But he didn’t provide specifics about which departments or regions would be affected. Later, the White House said instead, the EPA budget would be cut by 65%.

When asked to confirm, the EPA directed Michigan Public to the White House. When asked for details, the White House referred Michigan Public back to the EPA.

The prospect of a weaker EPA has advocates worried.

Rita Loch-Caruso, professor emeritus of toxicology at the University of Michigan, said she trusts EPA staff — but not the Trump administration officials running the agency.

“It's hard to feel optimistic when the EPA administrator just is effusive about cutting regulations,” she said. Loch-Caruso is also a board member of CARD.

In a statement, the EPA said Zeldin was committed “to the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Marianne Martin, who lives in a neighborhood where drinking water was contaminated with Gelman’s dioxane in the 1980s, said she doesn’t believe the Trump administration.

“I don't trust one minute of what [Trump’s] doing,” she said. She’s concerned cuts to the EPA could mean the end of the Superfund program.

“Without that, and without the push to make [the EPA] more effective, it's going to be a lot more neighborhoods like this all over,” Martin said.

The path forward

While local groups haven’t had much luck, government officials credit advocates like CARD and Dan Bicknell.

EGLE’s Chris Svoboda has been involved with the Gelman site for about two years. He said organizations like the coalition have made a difference.

“In my time here, the citizen advocates have definitely been a strong force for progress and getting things done,” he said. “I really think that they've had a huge impact throughout the whole course of the project.”

That’s unusual for a site that hasn’t been designated a Superfund site yet, said Anthony Mcglown, the EPA remedial project manager for the site.

“A really unique aspect of this site is just the community involvement that's been around this site for decades prior to EPA's involvement,” he said. Citizens usually get involved in a Superfund site after it has been added to the National Priorities List, not before, he said.

The EPA would continue tapping into that energy with a community involvement plan, Mcglown said. It’s part of the Superfund process.

“Those are tailored specifically to that site and that community,” Mcglown said. “And the important key first task in development of that plan is to go out and conduct community interviews to get the community feedback on how they would like us to engage.”

While EPA intervention is the best bet for the Gelman site, the state still needs to address the wider problem of industrial contamination, Rabhi said.

“We're not unique in the state in terms of problems like this,” he said. There are over 18,000 contaminated sites in Michigan (Gelman is one of them).

That’s thanks to the state’s history of heavy manufacturing. State environmental laws are woefully under-equipped to protect the public, advocates have argued.

In late 2024, a package of bills that would overhaul Michigan’s pollution cleanup regulations failed to pass the state House even though Democrats held a majority. The bill’s sponsors hope to continue negotiating with industry stakeholders and environmental groups this year, said State Senator Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor.

“I'm hopeful that we can reintroduce those bills pretty soon here, based on the progress and the trajectory that we had last fall,” he said. But Republican control of the House represents a potential “headwind,” Irwin said.

Rabhi is less optimistic about the legislation, but said he isn’t giving up. He wants to change how the government approaches regulating chemicals, especially emerging contaminants like dioxane.

“We should assume the worst,” Rabhi said. “We should assume that they're poisonous to us, until we can prove that they're not.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eac5fbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+450/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2Fe8%2F749ded8c4aa280a9ba2e8017e59a%2Fpsx-20250523-124314.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:14:03.383686

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle maker Rivian achieved its second consecutive quarterly gross profit in Q2, which triggered a $1 billion cash infusion from partner Volkswagen Group, CEO and founder RJ Scaringe said during a call with analysts May 6.

The funds, which executives expect to receive by the end of June, will aid Rivian in deploying its technology and software stack to a wide array of vehicles by capitalizing on VW’s scale as it pushes for broader EV adoption, according to Scaringe.

“The relationship there continues to progress really well,” Scaringe said of the partnership. “At this point, we're very focused on executing a lot of programs across the Volkswagen Group.”

Dive Insight:

In addition to financial support from VW, Rivian’s efforts to scale production has also been bolstered by a $6.6 billion Department of Energy loan finalized in January to revive the company’s stalled Georgia EV factory project, which is expected to start production by 2028.

The company is also investing $120 million in Normal, Illinois, where it is constructing a supplier park meant to create an electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem next to its production plant where it is building the R2 SUV.

However, like other automakers, Rivian also faces tariff-fueled headwinds necessitating plans to offset higher duties on automotive parts, especially battery components.

CFO Claire McDonough said on the call that the company expected “per unit direct impact from tariffs to be a couple thousand dollars for 2025 based off of the currently announced tariffs in place.”

Rivian’s chief concern is rising cost for battery materials. McDonough said while the company’s stockpile of batteries is sufficient to carry its production through early 2026, it continues to monitor export restrictions on rare earth minerals from China.

“We are actively monitoring these developments and working to mitigate potential risks through a variety of initiatives, including strategic sourcing and proactive engagement with policymakers,” she said.

Higher component costs due to tariffs moved Rivian to raise its capital expenditure guidance to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Uncertainty fueled by economic policies also led the company to revise its delivery outlook to 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, down from 46,000 to 51,000 announced April 2.

But Rivian believes higher production costs may be short-lived as it works with suppliers, including LG, to secure domestically produced batteries.

Agency officials said they haven’t yet had a chance to study the Supreme Court’s decision, and so it is unclear what the ruling’s impact will be, if any.
Surface Transportation Board, which produced 3,600 pages of analysis on the potential impact.
Seven counties that favored the development appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the potential environmental impact should be limited to the building of the railroad itself.
“The board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects,” he said.","The Supreme Court on Thursday sharply limited the reach of environmental impact statements in a victory for developers.

In an 8-0 decision, the justices said these claims of the potential impact on the environment have been used too often to delay or block new projects.

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development under the guise of just a little more process. A course correction of sorts is appropriate,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, speaking for the court.

He said judges and environmentalists have been given too much authority to hinder development.

“Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary,” he said. “And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.”

The decision could loom large in California and the West because the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has taken a broad view of environmental protection and the scope of impact statements.

“Today’s decision undermines decades of legal precedent that told federal agencies to look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment,” said Earthjustice Vice President Sam Sankar. “The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.”

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, described the court’s ruling as a “disastrous decision” that will undermine the nation’s bedrock environmental laws, ultimately resulting in more pollution and greater threats to public health.

“It guarantees that bureaucrats can put their heads in the sand and ignore the harm federal projects will cause to ecosystems, wildlife, and the climate,” Park said in a statement.

But Dan Wolff, an administrative law attorney with the D.C.-based firm Crowell & Moring, said he believes the Supreme Court’s decision is a reasonable interpretation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, or NEPA, and exercise of the court’s authority.

Over the decades, NEPA has ballooned from a straightforward reporting process into a lengthy rabbit hole of bureaucracy, he said. The court’s decision is intended to remind lower courts that that’s not what NEPA provides for.

The American Petroleum Institute welcomed the ruling.

“Today, the Supreme Court took long overdue steps to restore NEPA to its original intent and ensure a broken permitting process doesn’t stand in the way of American oil and natural gas production,” said its general counsel, Ryan Meyers. “This unanimous ruling underscores how NEPA has been weaponized by activists to block U.S. infrastructure of all kinds at the expense of American workers and consumers.”

The decision could have ramifications for major projects in California, including the high-speed rail — the largest public infrastructure project in the country — which will connect San Francisco to Anaheim. The majority of the project’s first phase has already cleared state and federal environmental review, according to the High-Speed Rail Authority.

But its last segment, which will link Los Angeles to Anaheim, has yet to undergo NEPA or the state’s equivalent known as the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA. Phase 2 of the project, which is still many years away but would eventually extend the system to connect Merced to Sacramento and Los Angeles to San Diego, also has yet to undergo the reviews.

Agency officials said they haven’t yet had a chance to study the Supreme Court’s decision, and so it is unclear what the ruling’s impact will be, if any.

The same is true for the Delta Conveyance Project — a proposed $20-billion tunnel that would move water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to cities and farmlands to the south that is undergoing NEPA review. Opponents of the controversial project have vowed to block the tunnel over concerns that it would harm the environment, fish species and local communities.

NEPA was the first of a series of landmark environmental laws. It required federal agencies to prepare a report assessing the likely impact of projects that will be funded or approved by the government.

NEPA has roots in California, where a 1969 oil spill off the coast helped spark the modern environmental movement. The spill, which occurred as Congress was drafting NEPA regulations, generated significant public outrage and helped galvanize national support for federal environmental protection laws.

But Kavanaugh said the “purely procedure law” of 1970 has been turned into “a substantive roadblock. ... The goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it.”

In Thursday’s unanimous decision, the high court ruled for the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in northeastern Utah, a spur line that could carry crude oil that would be refined along the Gulf Coast.

The project needed the approval of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, which produced 3,600 pages of analysis on the potential impact.

In blocking the proposal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals cited its potential to spur more drilling for oil in Utah and more pollution along the Gulf Coast. The judges said these “upstream” and “downstream” impacts of the railroad must be considered before the new rail line is approved.

Seven counties that favored the development appealed to the Supreme Court and argued the potential environmental impact should be limited to the building of the railroad itself.

Kavanaugh and the court agreed. “The board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects,” he said.

The court’s three liberals — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — concurred in the decision but did not sign on to Kavanaugh’s opinion. They agreed with the narrow focus on the project itself, but they did not join the criticism of judges.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a Colorado native who is friends with some of the leading developers, did not participate in the decision.

Sections of the rail line would run along the Colorado River.

Colorado Atty. Gen. Phil Weiser called the proposed railroad a “risky scheme to transport waxy crude oil along the Colorado River, right alongside our most critical water resource and posing major risks to Colorado’s Western Slope communities.”

Supporters of the project were celebrating.

“This decision affirms the years of work and collaboration that have gone into making the Uinta Basin Railway a reality,” said Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition. It “represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9bb63de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4559x2393+0+323/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2Fb3%2Fce176b734122b953c1692e6e9849%2Fsupreme-court-utah-oil-railway-63602.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:13:51.990486

Critics of the ruling are worried about increased oil extraction in Utah as well as additional refining in Gulf of Mexico communities.
""Our bedrock environmental laws, like NEPA, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters.""
""The last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want.""","In a 8-0 ruling on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court not only reversed a block on a proposed oil train in Utah but also narrowed a landmark federal environmental law, sparking intense alarm about what the ruling will mean for communities and all living things across the country.

""Today's decision undermines decades of legal precedent that told federal agencies to look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment,"" said Earthjustice senior vice president of program Sam Sankar in a statement. ""The Trump administration will treat this decision as an invitation to ignore environmental concerns as it tries to promote fossil fuels, kill off renewable energy, and destroy sensible pollution regulations.""

Since the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law in 1970 by Republican then-President Richard Nixon, it has become a key target for GOP policymakers aligned with the planet-wrecking fossil fuel industry, including President Donald Trump, who swiftly took aim at the law after returning to office in January.

""We urgently need to strengthen laws like NEPA, not weaken or narrow them, so that we can prioritize the health of people over polluters and corporate greed.""

NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for certain infrastructure projects. In 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit tossed both an EIS for the proposed Uinta Basin Railway and the U. S. Surface Transportation Board's approval of the project, which would connect Utah's oil fields to the national rail network.

After hearing arguments for Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County in December, the nation's highest court reversed that decision on Thursday, continuing a trend of rulings slammed by environmentalists as gifts to corporate polluters.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself without explanation. Politiconoted that ""it followed a public pressure campaign from environmental groups and Democrats who argued his close connections to the owner of oil and gas producer Anschutz—which filed a brief in the case saying NEPA's scope was critical to developing oil and gas reserves—disqualified him.""

Justice Brett Kavanagh delivered the opinion, joined by the other right-wingers who participated in the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion, joined by the other two liberals.

Kavanaugh wrote for the majority that ""the D. C. Circuit failed to afford the board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases and incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the board to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place from the Uinta Basin Railway.""

Environmental and public health advocates were quick to warn of the impacts of not only this 88-mile rail project, if completed, but also the decision more broadly.

""This decision is terrible news for the entire Colorado River Basin,"" said John Weisheit, conservation director at Living Rivers. ""To avoid the pending collapse of the Colorado River, we have to immediately reduce water consumption by 25% and cut carbon emissions by 50% by the end of this decade. Our federal decision-makers must deny any project that counters these objectives. The Uinta Basin Railway unquestionably falls into that category and should never see the light of day.""

Critics of the ruling are worried about increased oil extraction in Utah as well as additional refining in Gulf of Mexico communities.

""Regrettably, the Supreme Court has scored one for the oil companies who don't want you to look too closely at the harm their product will do to Black and Brown communities in Cancer Alley,"" said Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff. ""Our bedrock environmental laws, like NEPA, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters.""

""Fossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution,"" Shoaff stressed.

""The last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want.""

Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney Wendy Park declared that ""the last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don't want,"" and vowed to ""keep fighting to make sure this railway is never built.""

Park also looked beyond the train project, warning that ""this disastrous decision to undermine our nation's bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy.""

WildEarth Guardians staff attorney Katherine Merlin similarly emphasized that ""today's decision is a devastating loss for our wild places, our wild rivers, and for all of the human and nonhuman communities that depend on a clean environment and stable climate.""

In other words, they only kick in for community groups trying to identify illegal levels of air pollution.
Those prohibitive costs are, in a way, the reason community air monitoring programs exist in the first place.
A law passed earlier this year in Kentucky limits community air monitoring data in rulemaking, but does not attempt to stymie the public sharing of that data.
The plaintiffs want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the state attorney general’s office to be barred from enforcing CAMRA.","For several years, Amy Stelly has been partnering with the Louisiana State University School of Public Health in New Orleans to monitor air quality next to the Claiborne Expressway, a busy highway that runs northwest of the city’s iconic French Quarter.

At a community meeting in April, Stelly, who runs an organization called the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, was excited to unveil some of this data in a new interactive tool on the alliance’s website. People would be able to see hot spots for particulate matter — a pollutant generated by heavy traffic and associated with health risks like heart attacks and aggravated asthma — near their homes, schools, and workplaces. The data would support her push for the expressway’s removal and could be used by other neighborhood groups to advocate against highway expansion.

But the data on her website was short-lived. Stelly had her webmaster remove it soon after the community meeting. She had gotten wind of a 2024 state law that made it illegal to share air pollution data generated from technologies not approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Violations could incur hefty fines of up to $32,500 a day, with violations done “intentionally, willfully, or knowingly” racking up an additional $1 million.

“It just didn’t make sense to do a big push, given the fact that we were violating the law by even having a meeting,” Stelly said. “I can’t afford $32,500 a day. I don’t have that, nor do I have the million dollars. So it just seemed more prudent to remain quiet for a while.”

The Claiborne Avenue Alliance is part of a coalition of neighborhood and environmental groups that sued Louisiana regulators last week over the state’s Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA. The 2024 law was ostensibly meant to standardize community-based air monitoring programs throughout Louisiana, many of which had recently expanded thanks to funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But the community groups — including The Concerned Citizens of St. John; The Descendants Project; Jefferson, Orleans, Irish Channel Neighbors for Clean Air; Micah 6:8 Mission; and Rise St. James; along with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio — said the law is a de facto ban on the dissemination of their research and a violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech.

“It’s pretty mind-boggling,” Stelly said.

CAMRA was backed by petrochemical industry trade associations. It essentially says that if community groups want to monitor air pollution and share their data with the public, they have to use “an [EPA]-approved or promulgated emission test or monitoring method,” based on the pollutant being monitored. CAMRA’s requirements only apply to monitoring “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance” with federal, state, or local air quality laws. In other words, they only kick in for community groups trying to identify illegal levels of air pollution.

Pollutants covered by CAMRA include six federally regulated “criteria air pollutants” (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide), 188 federally regulated “hazardous air pollutants,” and 14 “toxic air pollutants” regulated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

According to a Louisiana DEQ study from earlier this year, regulatory-grade monitors for these pollutants costs more than $791,000 each, plus up to $200,000 more for annual maintenance and operations. Those prohibitive costs are, in a way, the reason community air monitoring programs exist in the first place. By using less expensive equipment, they’re able to deploy air monitors in places that would otherwise not be covered by the EPA’s reference monitors and the 27 air monitoring sites within the National Air Toxics Trends Station Network.

“There is no need for these groups to spend $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 on equipment when in fact there is equipment that, for $200 or less, will give you perfectly adequate results for you to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they’re breathing is safe,” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, at a press conference last week.

Cynthia Roberts, executive director of the nonprofit Micah 6:8 Mission — one of the groups that brought the lawsuit — told reporters that CAMRA “is not about protecting public health or ensuring good science. It’s about silencing communities like mine.” She said her organization’s air monitors near a Westlake Chemical complex in Sulphur, Louisiana, have frequently shown particulate matter concentrations higher than what the EPA considers unhealthy. Roberts used to post this information on Facebook. But now, she said, “simply posting that kind of data could cost us $32,500 per day.”

“That’s not just chilling,” she added. “That’s censorship, and it’s dangerous.”

None of the community groups that brought the lawsuit has been fined since CAMRA was enacted last year, but their leaders say the law has obstructed their work. Caitlion Hunter, research and policy coordinator for Rise St. James, said community air monitoring has been critical along the 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River dubbed “Cancer Alley” due to its density of petrochemical facilities and elevated cancer rate. People rely on her organization’s data, she said, because federal regulators have failed to monitor for ethylene oxide, a human carcinogen. Joy Banner, who co-directs The Descendants Project, said she “put a pause” on a planned program to publicize data from her nonprofit’s air quality monitors in St. John the Baptist Parish, in the heart of Cancer Alley.

CAMRA is “scaring us away from being able to share the data with our community members who need it the most,” Banner said at the press conference.

Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is representing the community groups alongside the Environmental Integrity Project, told Grist that CAMRA violates Louisianans’ First Amendment rights to free speech in three ways: First, it seeks to broadly regulate any “allegations” made against polluters — even if those allegations are made in an informal context, rather than in court. Second, it includes a provision requiring “quality assurance certifications” to be published alongside certain air pollution analyses, even though it doesn’t say what those certifications are. And third, it requires that any air pollution-related communications come with “clear explanations” of the data interpretation and any relevant uncertainties. Joshi described this as compelled speech — an “obvious” First Amendment violation — and said it wasn’t clear what the regulators would consider to be a sufficient explanation.

“It’s rare these days to see something so directly regulating speech,” Joshi said. The West Virginia House of Delegates passed a similar bill last year, but it died in the state senate. A law passed earlier this year in Kentucky limits community air monitoring data in rulemaking, but does not attempt to stymie the public sharing of that data.

The Louisiana community groups’ lawsuit also argues that CAMRA violates their First Amendment “right to petition” — to use their air monitoring data when asking the Department of Environmental Quality or the EPA to step in when clean air laws have been violated. A third claim says CAMRA is in conflict with the Clean Air Act and the EPA’s efforts under the Inflation Reduction Act to promote the use of community air sensors. The plaintiffs want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the state attorney general’s office to be barred from enforcing CAMRA.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment. The state’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, told Grist, “I’m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs ‘violates their constitutional rights.’ But we’ll defend the lawsuit.”

Stelly, with the Claiborne Avenue Alliance Design Studio, said she and her colleagues have found themselves in a confounding situation. In many cases, they obtained air sensors through EPA grants — but now they’re being told that those sensors are insufficient. For Stelly specifically, her grant and partnership with Louisiana State University will eventually require her to submit a written report on the data she’s collected, even though CAMRA suggests such a report could be illegal.

CAMRA “will force us into a position of noncompliance if we cannot provide that written report with that data,” she said. “It’s very weird.”

Clean Energy Generation

A community is a group of people who share common characteristics, interests, or goals, fostering a sense of belonging and shared identity. When SACE started the #Clean Energy Generation (CEG), it was our way of creating and supporting a community of people across all ‘generations’ working together to build a future powered by clean energy. CEG members are using our collective power to accelerate the transition as we pivot away from polluting fossil fuels to a future that is safe, healthy, and protects the people and places we love most.

As it turns out, lots of Southeasterners are heeding the call to join and take action. World Asthma Day on May 6, 2025, provided a great opportunity to educate, engage, and demonstrate that collective action is powerful!

Plugging into the Electric School Bus Effort

SACE is a proud member of the Alliance for Electric School Buses, a national consortium of non-profit organizations committed to transitioning our nation’s fleet of school buses to electric. This year, to honor World Asthma Day, the Alliance created a call to action to show support for continuing federal funding for clean electric school buses. This nationwide effort generated thousands of handwritten postcards and digital signatures in support of clean school buses.

Electric School Buses Offer One Asthma Solution

Clean, electric buses provide significant health benefits for children, particularly those with asthma. Studies have shown that reducing exposure to diesel exhaust by transitioning to zero-emission electric school buses can reduce asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses, and school absences. Diesel exhaust pollution is harmful for everyone, but is especially bad for kids as their lungs are developing.

At Earth Day events throughout our region in April, several members of the Clean Energy Generation spoke to friends, neighbors, and community members about the benefits of electric school buses. We helped make the connection between cleaner air associated with driving zero-emission electric school buses that lack a tailpipe. We educated members of our community about the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program, and the $5 billion in federal funding that was allocated for it through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Many of the people my colleague Janet and I spoke with at the Savannah Earth Day event had no idea that Georgia has 124 and Florida has 219 electric school buses safely transporting students to school. Some folks were also surprised to learn that Bluebird and Thomas Built buses are made by American workers in Georgia and North Carolina, respectively.

Turning Awareness into Action

After talking with community members, we asked them to take action in support of clean school buses via signing a digital letter that would be sent to their federal senators and representative or to hand write a postcard to one of their state senators, urging them to continue funding for these buses during the federal budget reconciliation process.

Kay Hudson, with the League of Women Voters (LWV) of Orange County, collected postcards at Orlando’s Earth Day event.

Scott Presson is a clean energy volunteer with the Sierra Club Georgia Chapter and encouraged his chapter to collect postcards.

Sara Vinson, co-founder of Sustainable Newton, collected postcards at the Cheerios Challenge/Earth Day Celebration on April 19th in Covington, Georgia.

Maxine Connor, Natural Resources Chair of the League of Women Voters of Citrus County, Co-Chair and co-chair of the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team, collected postcards at the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team table at the Earth Day Expo at the Extension office in Citrus County, FL on Saturday, April 26. Maxine is also the Natural Resources Chair of the League of Women Voters of Citrus County.

Rhudine Rush-Steele and friend Laura Bastarach called friends & canvassed to help collect postcards. The picture is at a goat yoga class held in their local park every year.

Mary Dipboye (not pictured) collected postcards through her work with the First Unitarian Church of Orlando. She is the co-chair of their Green Team.

Culmination of Day of Action

After collecting hundreds of postcards and virtual signatures in support of funding for clean school buses, SACE was proud to team up with partner advocacy organizations of the Alliance for Electric School Buses in both Georgia and Florida to deliver them to elected officials on World Asthma Day for a Day of Action.

In Georgia, SACE, Moms Clean Air Force and Climate Action Campaign delivered letters to Senator Jon Ossoff’s Atlanta office. We were joined by advocate Ramsey Nix, who wrote about the experience, and her two children.

In Florida, Lorna Perez, Florida Field Consultant and Sarah McBride, communications specialist, with Moms Clean Air Force, along with Karen Freedman, co-chair of the LWVFL Clean Energy Action Team, delivered them to Senator Rick Scott’s office in Tampa (X Video).

At Senator Ossoff’s office, we were able to meet with staff and thank them for the Senator’s support of clean school bus funding. At Senator Scott’s office, it was an opportunity to explain all the reasons why he should.

Both Day of Action events demonstrate how impactful CEG members can be in energizing their communities. They act as weavers, gathering together their community members and then connecting their collective action to the leaders who make decisions on behalf of their community.

It also shows how, when many voices are singing from the same score, the chorus is harmonious and unmistakable.

Rubin, trends in global engineering, corporate business",,,,,https://www.enr.com/articles/60812-trump-admin-pushes-rule-to-reverse-mandate-to-cut-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions,"The Trump administration announced several new actions in recent days to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S., particularly from coal-fired plants.
“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters.
It said the draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, and cutting the emissions would have no “meaningful effect” on public health.
But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in the level of polluting power plant emissions.
They also expressed concern it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.","The Trump administration announced several new actions in recent days to boost fossil fuel power generation in the U.S., particularly from coal-fired plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed to media on May 24 that it is drafting a proposed regulation to eliminate all current restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, set to be published in the Federal Register after federal agencies' review.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had said in a March press release announcing the agency's intention to review the Biden administration's power plant regulations. “Many have voiced concerns that the last administration's replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching,” an EPA spokesperson told Reuters. “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

The use of coal power has been on the decline in the U.S. since 2005 and is more expensive to operate than wind or solar energy—before factoring in the Biden-era emissions reduction rules.

The confirmation came several days after the New York Times had reported the plans, based on sources and review of internal EPA documents.

It said the draft regulation states that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions, and cutting the emissions would have no “meaningful effect” on public health. The U.S. share of emissions is just 3% of global pollution from power generation, and the U.S. has reduced its share of global emissions in the past 20 years, down from representing 5.5% of global emissions in 2005, EPA contends in the draft rule. But UN data has found that fossil fuels now account for more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of CO2 emissions, with the U.S. second to China in the level of polluting power plant emissions.

EPA released no further details of the draft rule but said it could be released in June, theTimes reported, also speculating that it could be finalized by end of the year, “an extraordinarily fast pace.”

Supporters are optimistic, but other observers expect the rule to face lawsuits if it becomes final. They also expressed concern it could block future administrations from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants and undermine climate change regulation.

“It is a good step forward in line with the rule of law,” Thomas Pyle, president of oil and gas advocacy group American Energy Alliance, told the Washington Post. But Vickie Patton, Environmental Defense Fund general counsel said “fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,” calling the proposed rule “an abuse of [EPA] responsibility under the law. ... that flies in the face of common sense.”

'Emergency Order'

The EPA news came a day after an “emergency order” from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to prevent the planned May 31 shutdown of the 1.56-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., by grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Michigan utility Consumers Energy, which DOE said “is 15 years before the end of its scheduled design life.” Wright said the action, set to last until Aug. 21, is authorized under the Federal Power Act and “is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency.”

Michigan utility regulators called the federal order “unnecessary” and noted there was no power emergency in the state or the Midwest region. Katie Carey, a Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that the utility “plans to comply with the 90-day pause. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration moved May 22 to support a lawsuit by Texas and 12 other states against large private infrastructure investors Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advsors, claiming they conspired to reduce competition in the U.S. coal sector, which risks undermining the federal goal of domestic energy independence. The U.S. Justice Dept. and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case that State Street called “baseless.”

President Donald Trump also signed four executive orders for a faster buildout of U.S. nuclear power plants, including a directive for the Energy and Defense Departments to build reactors at military bases, on federal lands and sited near data centers.

The orders also seek strategies for how reactors could be constructed without approval of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and sets a goal to increase U.S. nuclear power generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up fourfold from the current 100 GW level that comes from the output of more than than 90 operating reactors.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/05/29/CAMPBELL-COALPLANTCONSUMERS-ENERGY.jpg?height=635&t=1748548795&width=1200,N,,2025-05-29 17:11:35.527621

Last week, the House narrowly passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” and proposed terminating most of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which had tax incentives for producers of so called “clean energy” sources such as wind and solar.

Tesla’s energy subsidiary has seen quiet but steady growth over the years, becoming more relatively profitable that the more well-known automotive division. In 2024 the company boasted a more than a 50% growth, far outpacing Tesla’s other divisions.

Although the bill has yet to pass the Senate, the GOP’s disincentivizing of clean energy manufacturing could slice into one of the fastest growing sectors of Musk’s empire.

Musk later posted: “There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

Musk had previously stated that he opposed government subsides of any kind, posting in November just after Trump’s election: “In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.”

The posts come hours after Musk announced he was leaving his government advisory position as the head the Department of Government Efficiency to return full-time to running his various businesses. Upon leaving, Musk lamented that his work at DOGE didn’t result in any meaningful government cutbacks after viewing the GOP’s proposed bill.

“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said.

The bill phases out incentives that drive investment, create jobs, and support Michigan’s net-zero carbon target by 2050.

Stricter supply chain mandates targeting foreign ties may hinder innovation, raise prices, and disrupt local manufacturers.

Economic forecasts predict billions in lost output and a potential 10% rise in electricity bills for Michigan residents by 2035.

The legislation could stall or halt many clean energy projects, threatening both environmental and economic goals.

The final outcome depends on Senate decisions and high-stakes political negotiations ahead.

The rolling farmlands and lake-studded skyline of Michigan have become unexpected battlegrounds in the nationwide fight for clean energy—now threatened by freshly passed legislation in the U.S. House. Supporters of clean energy describe the budget reconciliation bill as a decisive blow to Michigan’s growing climate leadership, warning that its aggressive rollback of federal tax credits could derail years of progress and put billions in economic gains on the line.

Under the current framework, Michigan’s solar and wind turbines spin steadily, buoyed by federal and state incentives. Those credits drive investment, create jobs, and power a slow but sure surge toward the state’s declared net-zero carbon goal by 2050. But the new bill signals an abrupt shift: it phases out these critical tax benefits for both industrial-scale clean energy projects and homegrown efforts. By the end of 2025, families installing solar panels or buying electric vehicles would lose federal tax advantages, shutting doors to many who hoped to transition to greener choices.

The ramifications go deeper. Manufacturers would suddenly face strict mandates to trace their supply chains for any hint of foreign ties—especially to China or Russia—a process described by energy advocates as arduous at best and “virtually impossible” for many companies. Such requirements could stifle innovation, stall new projects, and drive up prices across the board. Studies estimate that by 2035, Michigan’s economic output would shrink by several billion dollars, consumers could see electricity bills spike by 10%, and the once-crowded pipeline of clean energy projects could dry up almost overnight.

Without robust federal backing, Michigan’s vision of a carbon-free future dims. The state, which has pledged to slash the lion’s share of CO2 emissions by 2050 and rely on cutting-edge carbon-removal technologies, faces a steeper climb. The urgency is real. Climate science warns that delayed action means more floods along Lake Michigan, more droughts across the mitten-shaped state, and severe weather that could rattle both local economies and everyday lives.

The recent vote illuminates deep fault lines in U.S. climate policy. While some Republican leaders label the measure as a tool to cut “wasteful spending,” clean energy proponents counter that the true cost will be shouldered by workers, families, and Michigan’s environment. The debate isn’t over: the U.S. Senate must still weigh in, and August’s looming debt ceiling deadline raises the political stakes even higher.

Every piece of legislation shapes the future in quiet but profound ways. As Michigan stands at a crossroads—risking its clean energy momentum—the core question echoes far beyond state lines: Will America continue to invest in a greener, more resilient economy, or step back just as the world’s climate clock ticks ever faster?

Bottom line: Federal policies matter more than headlines suggest. If the bill becomes law, Michigan may trade its ambitious energy goals for economic uncertainty and higher costs. The coming months will show whether the state—and the nation—chooses to power forward or hit pause on the clean energy revolution.

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court backed a multibillion-dollar oil railroad expansion in Utah Thursday in a ruling that scales back a key environmental law and could accelerate development projects around the country.

The 8-0 decision comes after an appeal to the high court from backers of the project, which is aimed at quadrupling oil production in the remote area of sandstone and sagebrush.

Environmental groups said the decision would have sweeping impacts on National Environmental Policy Act reviews. President Donald Trump's administration has already said it's speeding up that process after the president in January declared a “national energy emergency” and vowed to boost U.S. oil and gas development.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh referred to the decision as a “course correction"" in an opinion fully joined by four conservative colleagues.

“Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects,” he wrote. The three liberal justices agreed the Utah project should get its approval, but they would have taken a narrower path.

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-kilometer) expansion that would connect the oil-rich region of northeast Utah to the national rail network, allowing oil and gas producers to access larger markets. The state's crude oil production was valued at $4.1 billion in 2024, according to a Utah Geological Survey report, and could increase substantially under the expansion project.

The justices reversed a lower court decision and restored a critical approval from federal regulators on the Surface Transportation Board.

Construction, though, does not appear to be imminent. Project leaders must obtain several permits and secure necessary financing with private-sector partners before they can break ground, said Uinta Basin Railway spokesperson Melissa Cano.

Environmental groups and a Colorado county had argued that regulators must consider a broad range of potential impacts when they consider new development, such as increased wildfire risk, the effect of additional crude oil production from the area and increased refining in Gulf Coast states.

The justices, though, found that regulators were right to consider the direct effects of the project, rather than the wider upstream and downstream impact. Kavanaugh wrote that courts should defer to regulators on “where to draw the line” on what factors to take into account. “The goal of the law is to inform agency decision making, not to paralyze it,” he said.

The court’s conservative majority court has taken steps to curtail the power of federal regulators in other cases, however, including striking down the decades-old Chevron doctrine that made it easier for the federal government to set a wide range of regulations.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a concurrence that the court could have simply cleared the way for the railway approval by saying that regulators did not need to consider increased fossil fuel production tied to the project.

Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case after facing calls to step aside over ties to Philip Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire whose ownership of oil wells in the area means he could benefit if the project goes through. Gorsuch, as a lawyer in private practice, had represented Anschutz.

The ruling comes after Trump’s vow to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from former President Joe Biden’s focus on climate change. The administration announced last month it’s speeding up environmental reviews of projects required under the same law at the center of the Utah case, compressing a process that typically takes a year or more into just weeks.

“The court's decision gives agencies a green light to ignore the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their decisions and avoid confronting them,” said Sambhav Sankar, senior vice president of programs at Earthjustice.

Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said opponents would continue to fight the Utah project. “This disastrous decision to undermine our nation’s bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy,"" she said.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the ruling affirms a “balanced approach” to environmental oversight. He praised the railroad expansion as a critical infrastructure project that will help “restore America’s energy independence” and bolster the state's rural economy.

James Coleman, a professor at University of Minnesota Law School, said the ruling is an “important corrective"" that would have judges deferring to federal regulators rather than requiring them to consider upstream and downstream effects of energy transportation projects.

The project’s public partner also applauded the ruling. “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability,"" said Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition.

Inside a sprawling manufacturing facility, workers are building batteries that will power 130,000 homes — part of a broader economic renaissance reshaping the commonwealth’s industrial landscape. Through strategic federal investments in clean energy and manufacturing, Pennsylvania is witnessing the creation of thousands of jobs while positioning itself at the forefront of tomorrow’s clean energy economy. This transformation isn’t just about environmental progress — it’s about building a stronger, more resilient economic future for Pennsylvania’s workers and families.

At the heart of this revolution is Eos Energy Enterprises, where a $303.5 million federal loan guarantee is fueling an ambitious expansion. The company isn’t just creating jobs — it’s cultivating careers. Through its innovative Clean Energy Careers Program, Eos is partnering with local high schools and trade schools to develop the skilled workforce needed for tomorrow. This forward-thinking approach ensures that economic benefits flow directly into local communities, creating sustainable career pathways for residents.

The impact of this clean energy transformation extends far beyond single facilities or communities. A new study, “If You Fund It, They Will Come,” recently released by ReImagine Appalachia and the Keystone Research Center, reveals how wide-reaching these investments have been. Between 2022 and 2024, after the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act were in place, $9.8 billion in clean energy investments have come to Pennsylvania, the majority of which were private dollars, spurred by public investments. And these investments are bridging political divides. Since early 2022, communities in both Democratic and Republican congressional districts have attracted substantial clean energy investments, demonstrating that economic progress can unite rather than divide.

Pennsylvania’s success story is rooted in its ability to leverage its rich industrial heritage for clean energy innovation. Investment patterns show a remarkable balance between urban and rural communities, with particular momentum in regions traditionally dependent on conventional energy production. This equitable distribution ensures the clean energy transition lifts all communities, leaving no one behind.

The transformation runs deeper than economic metrics. In communities across the commonwealth, new manufacturing facilities are becoming hubs of innovation, fostering vital connections between industry and education. The Eos project exemplifies how Pennsylvania can maintain its energy leadership while embracing cleaner technologies. These investments create ripple effects throughout local economies, strengthening everything from small businesses to community institutions.

As these initiatives take root, they create robust industrial ecosystems that promise enduring economic benefits. Across Pennsylvania, federal clean energy investments are laying the groundwork that will benefit multiple generations of workers. This comprehensive approach ensures both immediate gains and lasting prosperity.

Pennsylvania’s emergence as a clean energy leader carries national significance. We’re creating a blueprint for industrial communities nationwide by marrying our manufacturing heritage with cutting-edge technology. This leadership position attracts additional investment and talent, generating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and innovation.

To sustain this momentum, we must continue supporting federal programs like the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These aren’t mere policy initiatives — they’re investments in Pennsylvania’s future as a clean energy manufacturing powerhouse and they are a significant driver of private investment in our region. Our success thus far demonstrates the transformative potential of these programs.

As Pennsylvania stands at this crucial economic crossroads, the evidence is clear: investments in clean energy and manufacturing are creating jobs, driving innovation, and building a stronger economic future. The Commonwealth’s successful transition toward clean energy manufacturing demonstrates that environmental stewardship and economic growth can work hand in hand, creating a model for industrial renaissance in the 21st century. By continuing to support and expand these investments, we can ensure that Pennsylvania remains at the forefront of America’s clean energy economy for generations to come.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/05/8546245_web1_ptr-McCormickTour007-040825.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 17:10:54.697621

BOSTON – The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) released its 2024 Massachusetts Clean Energy Industry Report today, highlighting that the clean energy industry is home to over 115,291 direct clean energy workers, having grown 100 percent since 2010. The industry contributed more than $15.9 billion to the Gross State Product (GSP) in 2023, a 74 percent increase since 2012. It also shows that 7,512 clean energy businesses exist across the state. Regarding direct jobs, the clean energy industry has a similar number as the College & University or Scientific Research industries, yet exceeds both industries' economic contribution in indirect and induced jobs and state GSP.

MassCEC’s 2024 report also found that 74 percent of clean energy jobs and businesses are located outside Route 128, and 58 percent of clean energy firms are small businesses (10 or fewer workers). A majority (53 percent) of clean energy workers are employed in energy efficiency, demand management, and clean heating and cooling jobs.

“Massachusetts is growing our global leadership in clean energy innovation, and we’re creating thousands of good-paying jobs and new businesses in the process,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Last year, I signed legislation to advance the development of homegrown clean energy and make Massachusetts the world’s climate innovation leader. As MassCEC’s report shows, our work is paying off—Massachusetts is setting the standard for the clean energy revolution.”

“Clean energy is a statewide success story, powered by a workforce of over 115,000 workers from Pittsfield to Provincetown,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “This report highlights how every region is playing a role in building our clean energy future, with small businesses, startups and global leaders choosing Massachusetts as their home. We’re committed to ensuring that all communities share in the benefits of this growing industry.”

“Massachusetts is proving that climate leadership fuels economic growth. From solar to geothermal, our clean energy transformation is creating thousands of good-paying jobs across a wide range of industries,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “This report showcases how electricians, HVAC specialists, and manufacturing workers are all playing an important role in making our state more energy independent. The strength of our workforce and the momentum we’ve built ensures that the clean energy economy is growing right here at home.”

“This year’s report reaffirms what we already know—the Massachusetts clean energy industry has grown into an economic force that is delivering real results for residents, workers, and communities. With a robust workforce, expanding industry sectors, and a strong commitment to climate resilience, we are charting a course for long-term success,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert. “At MassCEC, we’re focused on scaling these opportunities, creating equitable access to clean energy careers, and accelerating progress toward our net-zero goals.”

Since 2010, the Massachusetts clean energy industry has experienced 100 percent job growth, adding 57,610 new workers. This report also includes data from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s Workforce Needs Assessment which projected that Massachusetts needs about 28,000[TB1][EC2] more clean energy workers by the end of the decade.

To address this need, Governor Healey signed An Act promoting a clean energy grid, advancing equity, and protecting ratepayers and the Mass Leads Act in late 2024, two laws that will accelerate clean energy development and climate innovation while creating jobs and economic opportunities.

Released annually by MassCEC since 2010, the report includes data from December 2023. MassCEC’s methodology for the report, developed with BW Research Partnership, has been replicated by several other states and the U.S. Department of Energy. Read the full MassCEC Industry Report here[TB3][EC4] .

“It’s the environmental licensing that prevents us from having disasters,” Wallace Lopes, deputy director of ASCEMA, the association of federal environmental specialists, told Mongabay.
“That’s why we say it’s the end of environmental licensing,” she told Mongabay in a phone interview.
It creates a Special Environmental License for strategic projects, which could be approved in a single step within one year.
Lopes, from ASCEMA, said the real solution to speed up environmental licensing is to hire more staff for environmental bodies.","Brazil’s Congress is likely to approve what experts describe as the country’s most significant environmental setback since 1988 when the Constitution was enacted. Bill 2159/2021, which changes several rules of the environmental licensing framework, was approved by the Senate on May 21, six months before Brazil hosts the COP30 climate summit in the Amazonian city of Belém. The bill was heavily criticized by environmental organizations and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change — and celebrated by the powerful conservative forces of the Brazilian Congress. Experts argued that many of the bill’s provisions are unconstitutional.

Nevertheless, in the following days, it should easily pass its final vote in the Chamber of Deputies, controlled by the agribusiness, mining and energy caucus.

“Brazil, as president of the COP, cannot demonstrate to the whole world that it is going backwards in terms of caring for the environment by attacking its main environmental law,” representative Nilto Tatto, the environmental caucus coordinator in the Chamber of Deputies, told Mongabay. “We will long remember the day when the main damage prevention tool of the National Environmental Policy was completely weakened,” Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator at the civil society coalition Climate Observatory, stated on the organization’s website.

According to the current legislation, an environmental license is mandatory for all enterprises that use natural resources and may cause damage to the environment or local communities. The entrepreneur has to conduct studies to assess the project’s eventual impacts and propose mitigation measures. It is up to environmental experts from the federal, state or municipal levels to approve such studies and monitor the enterprises along the years, to ensure these rules are followed — a process often criticized for being too slow.

“It’s the environmental licensing that prevents us from having disasters,” Wallace Lopes, deputy director of ASCEMA, the association of federal environmental specialists, told Mongabay. “There is no other prevention tool. Inspection, punishment — all of this is for after the crime has already happened.”

The bill, however, exempts from these demands all small or medium-sized undertakings, which would undergo a much simpler process called License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC). Through this license, entrepreneurs would fill out an online form describing how their project isn’t breaking any environmental rules, and they would automatically be ready to move forward — a form of self-licensing. Around 80% of the projects that apply for licensing in Brazil today would fall under LAC, according to Ana Carolina Crisostomo, WWF-Brasil’s conservation expert. “That’s why we say it’s the end of environmental licensing,” she told Mongabay in a phone interview.

“The person presents the information, and there is no analysis of these documents,” Lopes said. “The name ‘license’ doesn’t even fit. If the person does everything themselves, why should the state have to authorize them or not?”

An example of a project that would fall under self-licensing is the Brumadinho dam, built by the mining company Vale in Minas Gerais state. In January 2019, the structure collapsed, releasing more than 12 million cubic meters (423.8 million cubic feet) of mine tailings and killing more than 270 people. The Paraopeba River, flooded with all the toxic mud, remains contaminated six years after the disaster.

“With the full license in force, we have already seen an accident like this because there was no inspection, no compliance,” Crisostomo said. “Now imagine if this dam is approved through a simplified process. Half of the preventive and remedial actions would not have been planned and could not have been implemented.”

The voting happened the same week the Brazilian environmental agency, IBAMA, bowed to political pressures, including from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and approved a key step that could allow offshore oil drilling that threatens the mouth of the Amazon River. The state oil company Petrobras is now one step away from getting the license to explore an area with a high risk of oil spills, according to environmental agents. In the case of an accident, oil could reach eight countries, the Amazon’s great coral reef and the world’s largest mangrove belt.

One of the legal devices of the new law would precisely benefit projects deemed “strategic” by the federal administration, such as the exploration of the Amazon coast; the national oil agency will offer another 47 blocks on the same area in a public bid on June 17. The decision about what is or isn’t strategic would be up to a political council.

The measure was proposed at the last minute by the Senate’s president, Davi Alcolumbre, a staunch defender of Petrobras’ controversial project in its home state, Amapá. It creates a Special Environmental License for strategic projects, which could be approved in a single step within one year.

“It’s quite clear that this amendment was custom-made because of the controversy surrounding the well in the Amazon River Mouth Basin,” said ASCEMA’s Lopes. He added that many kinds of projects can be considered strategic, including hydroelectric plants, large roads and mining complexes.

Lula has a long-held appreciation for large infrastructure projects. The most notorious example is the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant, initiated in Lula’s second term (2007-10) and concluded by his political ally Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), which altered the course of the Xingu River, displaced tens of thousands of people and caused the deaths of more than 85,000 fish.

“There is a very old vision of development within the federal government, and the president expresses this a lot,” Crisostomo said.

The special license may also apply to projects like Ferrogrão, a railway connecting Brazil’s granary states to the Tapajós River, which could lead to the deforestation of 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles) according to the Climate Policy Initiative.

The same applies to the paving of BR-319, a road connecting the capitals of Rondônia and Amazonas states, Porto Velho and Manaus. The project could also benefit from another innovation from the bill, which facilitates the licensing of improvement works to existing projects.

“According to the bill, the paving of this road would not require a license,” Lopes said. “But the environmental impact is completely different when you pave such a road.”

The Brazilian government opened the road in the 1970s, but there is an unpaved 400-km (250-mi) stretch that becomes undrivable for most of the year. Studies show that putting asphalt on his section would result in a fourfold increase in deforestation rates around it, which lies in one of the Amazon’s most preserved areas. Forty conservation areas and 50 Indigenous territories would be affected, including isolated Indigenous groups.

“If the law created a self-license for small and medium-sized businesses and a special license for large businesses, then there’s nothing left,” Lopes said.

Ignoring traditional communities

The bill also exempts entrepreneurs from considering their projects’ impact on hundreds of Indigenous and Quilombola communities — inhabited by descendants of enslaved Black people — that haven’t been fully titled by the federal administration.

According to Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), a Brazilian NGO fighting for traditional people, 259 Indigenous lands would be excluded from the impact studies, 32.6% of all territories. When it comes to Quilombola communities, 1,553 of them would be ignored (80%). “They will be considered nonexistent for the purposes of environmental licensing, impact assessment and the requirement for conditions to prevent, mitigate or compensate for socioenvironmental impacts,” ISA stated in a technical note. According to ISA, Brazil’s conservation units would also be ignored in the licensing process unless the venture’s facilities are located directly inside them.

The bill also exempts agriculture and cattle ranching from environmental licensing. Ranchers will still need authorization to deforest but won’t have to present studies showing how much water they will collect from the streams, where they will dispose of their waste or how much wood they will take from that area. “We have strong indications that deforestation will increase a lot,” Crisostomo said.

In a public statement, Brazil’s environmental ministry said the bill “represents a significant dismantling of the existing rules on the subject and poses a risk to the country’s environmental and social security,” besides being “silent on the climate crisis.” On May 27, after being harassed by congressmen in a Senate commission, Marina Silva, the Environment and Climate Change minister, said that “the environmental licensing is an achievement of Brazilian society” and “only the Brazilian people can prevent this dismantling that is being proposed.”

The Climate Observatory stated in a public letter that “the approval of this bill will seriously compromise the country’s environmental credibility” and “could prevent Brazil from meeting its emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.”

Brazil’s leading federal health research center, Fiocruz, also published a technical note stating the bill “relativizes the responsibility of entrepreneurs and reduces the capacity of the State to ensure the protection of life, collective health and ecosystems.”

Supporters of the bill said it will bring legal security and reduce bureaucracy for Brazilian entrepreneurs. During debates, many senators endorsed the proposal, saying it won’t hurt nature since it’s not changing environmental protection laws, only speeding up licenses, despite warnings from experts. “There are things that can be licensed much more quickly; we don’t have the people to analyze everything that is being proposed in a notarial manner,” Senator Tereza Cristina, the project’s rapporteur and a leader of the agribusiness caucus, told CNN Brazil. Cristina acted as the agriculture minister of former President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-22), whose far-right policies looked to reduce environmental protections.

However, experts say the law may increase legal uncertainty since it will be up to each state or municipality to determine a project’s impacts and the kind of licensing it must follow. “How will we have legal certainty if we have a proliferation of rules instead of standardization? It will generate a lot of judicialization,” WWF’s Crisostomo said.

Lopes, from ASCEMA, said the real solution to speed up environmental licensing is to hire more staff for environmental bodies. “The reality is that there are no people to do the work. And that’s what the bill doesn’t tackle.”

Representative Tatto and NGOs admit the chances of reverting the bill in the Deputy’s Chamber are low. President Lula may veto some of the articles if the proposal is approved, but Congress will likely overturn them. The last resource would be to contest the law in the Supreme Court. “We’ll go as far as judicializing it because it’s a flagrant affront to the Constitution itself,” Tatto said.

NEPA is the way for federal agencies to consider a project’s harm and alternatives that could lessen that harm.","What’s happening: In a case called Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, the Supreme Court undermined the principle that the government must consider predictable environmental harms before approving big projects.

In this case, Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity represented environmental and public health groups in defending this common-sense approach, which protects both people and the environment from ill-conceived proposals.

Why it matters: This case is part of a broad attack by polluting industries and their political allies seeking to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a federal law that gives the public a voice in environmental decision-making and helps agencies account for the impact of proposed projects.

Now that these industries have gotten their way, more pipelines, chemical facilities, and other destructive infrastructure could get approved without the federal agencies involved having to consider their potentially harmful environmental effects. The Court’s decision, coupled with other recent federal actions to weaken the regulations implementing NEPA, creates more chaos and confusion and will likely result in more litigation.

The Facts of the Case

Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County is about an 88-mile proposed rail project in Utah that would transport waxy crude oil from the Uinta Basin to existing rail networks in Colorado, ultimately allowing the oil to end up in the ports and refineries in the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. The rail line’s backers believe it could increase oil production in the region up to five-fold.

A coalition of environmental groups and Eagle County, Colorado, challenged the rail project’s approval in court. They argued that it violated NEPA’s requirement that the federal agency responsible for approving the project must disclose and analyze all reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.

In 2023, a federal court threw out the project’s approval. The court found that the federal agency, the Surface Transportation Board, failed to explain why it did not address harms from increased drilling in the Basin and from increased crude oil refining on the Gulf Coast. The agency also failed to weigh the impact of spills and accidents involving oil trains, including contaminating the Colorado River.

A coalition of county governments that wanted the railroad built took the decision to the Supreme Court. The counties argued against settled law that requires agencies to consider predictable environmental harms before deciding whether to permit a project.

What’s at Stake

Industry and its allies wanted the Court to prevent our government from looking before it leaps. Congress wrote NEPA to make sure that government agencies consider the environmental consequences of their decisions before acting. In this case, polluting industries and their allies successfully convinced the Court to put blinders on those agencies and keep the public in the dark.

The proposed rail line won’t just affect the communities and habitats that it would run through. Its construction means that trains full of crude oil will travel precariously close to the Colorado River. Its ultimate destination was the refineries along the Gulf, an area already overburdened by the negative impacts of fossil fuel production whose residents would face more exposure to toxic pollution. Burning that oil will also worsen climate change and increase extreme weather events across the country.

Earthjustice got involved in this fight because agencies need to make transparent, well-informed decisions that incorporate concerns from affected communities — as the law requires them to do. NEPA is the way for federal agencies to consider a project’s harm and alternatives that could lessen that harm. It’s a valuable tool for engaging communities, promoting transparency, and ensuring the government is making well-informed decisions that benefit the public good.

The U.S. automotive sector risks being left behind as the rest of the world undergoes a revolutionary transformation to electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles.
Even though U.S. companies currently perform strongly in autonomous driving, dismissing electric and connected vehicles will lead to long-term challenges for U.S. companies, which will need to excel in all three technologies in the long term.
The United States should evaluate whether it wants to be associated with old technology rather than the forefront of innovation, as it had traditionally been.
U.S. companies and research institutions have remarkably advanced technology, but they will be unlikely to commercialize it if there is no market domestically.","As the Senate considers the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by the House, Congress faces critical choices that could reshape the future of U.S. industry—especially in relation to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and more generally, strategic decisions over how to best promote U.S. competitiveness in advanced technologies.

For the automotive sector, the stakes are high: The 30D consumer tax credits and the 45X advanced manufacturing production credits are at risk of being canceled or significantly curtailed. This comes at a time when the Trump administration is also seeking to reduce fuel-economy standards, and Congress has overturned a waiver that allows California to set its own standards for emissions, effectively striking down the state’s ban on the sale of non-electric vehicles (EVs) past 2035. Charging infrastructure also remains woefully inadequate, but the current administration has paused new funding to expand it. The combined effect would be a 180-degree policy change for an industry that requires years of planning, and the removal of the consumer tax credits would largely nullify incentives to localize manufacturing and diversify supply chains. Large investments from industry were planned in batteries, automotive manufacturing, and critical mineral mining and refining, with the assumption of long-term policy stability, an assumption that is now in doubt. Perhaps even more concerning, the current approach to the automotive sector risks holding back U.S. innovation.

In the short term, a slowdown in the EV transition might benefit traditional U.S. automakers that are still struggling to make EVs profitably. However, it carries long-term effects for the United States. The U.S. automotive sector risks being left behind as the rest of the world undergoes a revolutionary transformation to electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles. If the federal government does not demonstrate more foresighted leadership, the United States may find that in less than a decade its companies have less say in setting global standards and have a shrinking global market because domestic regulation held back rather than push forward innovation, which would be vital to facilitate the testing and scaling of new-generation vehicles.

The latest data from the International Energy Agency underscores this point: In 2024, EVs accounted for 20 percent of global auto sales. The European Union, despite slow sales growth, was on average consistent with the trend, maintaining an average sales rate of 20 percent. China broke all records again, hitting almost 50 percent. But the United States lags, with EV sales currently at 10 percent and with low expectations for growth in the coming years. So, while the world as a whole is expected to reach a 25 percent EV sales rate in 2025 and 40 percent by 2030, the United States is expected to stay relatively stagnant at 11 percent in 2025. Some may think this is positive news because it will allow U.S. automakers to continue selling internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for longer. However, the technological lag in what is clearly going to be the direction of travel for the rest of the world should concern those who want the United States to stay technologically relevant and a leader in key technologies like the automotive sector.

Even with faster EV adoption, gas-powered cars are likely to continue selling well across much of the United States and globally over the next decade. Meanwhile, U.S. companies with valuable technologies, ranging from EV platforms and next-generation battery chemistries to alternative methods of extracting and processing critical minerals, would be far better positioned to achieve commercialization in both a growing domestic market and abroad. A comprehensive set of policies aimed at undermining EV adoption would have a chilling effect on investment and production in the United States and would inhibit U.S. companies from being able to scale their new technologies to compete internationally to access markets. According to a study by Princeton University, up to 72 percent of battery cell manufacturing capacity currently operating in the United States, as well as all planned capacity, would be at risk of closure if clean tax credits are repealed. Demand for EVs would not necessarily drop as significantly, but consumers would have far less incentive to buy vehicles with U.S.-made batteries. This will be made more challenging given that tariffs look poised to increase globally, and Chinese companies with formidable cost competitiveness and technology are expanding their international reach rapidly.

The U.S. debate over clean technology has become politicized in ways that obscure its core appeal in many markets where decisions are driven less by ideology than performance and price. EVs are still very expensive in the United States, averaging $55,000 in December 2024, or 12 percent more than the average ICE vehicle, but in China, EVs have the same cost as ICE vehicles, and the price is lower in some segments. Chinese EV exports have revolutionized the market in many emerging markets: EVs are now cheaper than ICE vehicles in Thailand, for example. But it’s not all about Chinese brands: For example, European regulation has incentivized domestic automakers to develop cheaper EV models, which are expected to hit the market in 2026. Meanwhile, low-cost EV offerings in the United States are expected to only expand marginally in the near future, which helps explain why they are sometimes viewed as an elite project.

Globally, consumers and governments have shown a strong interest in EVs because of energy security and efficiency concerns, but also because of the strong synergies between electric drivetrains and digital platforms. EVs are often equipped with more advanced software that makes driving easier and more pleasant. A recent global survey found that 92 percent of respondents who owned an EV would buy another EV if they had to replace their car tomorrow, and 97 percent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with their choice to own an EV. This all means that the technology’s global popularity will only increase in the coming years.

Connectivity, autonomous driving, and electric drivetrains are self-reinforcing technologies, as China’s exponential growth in the sector demonstrates. Even though U.S. companies currently perform strongly in autonomous driving, dismissing electric and connected vehicles will lead to long-term challenges for U.S. companies, which will need to excel in all three technologies in the long term.

In countries with high EV model availability—often thanks to lower tariffs—sales are rising rapidly even when other incentives are not present. However, when high tariffs are in place, usually to protect the domestic industry, the question gets more complex. Indeed, that is the situation the United States finds itself in today as well. The IRA, for all its flaws, recognized that if supply chains were to shift to the United States, they would likely face higher costs requiring initial government incentives to help achieve scale. Those incentives have been important in unlocking new investments in critical minerals, for example. This administration has recognized that deregulation can help further lower domestic costs and spur more investment. These two insights combined could be a powerful formula to empower future investment.

Compete or Isolate?

The United States needs to engage and compete in the future of the automotive industry or risk technological isolation. Despite potential synergies with other countries on national security issues concerning China, the automotive sector is one where it is hard to envision the United States swaying large portions of the world to reject Chinese technology. In fact, some European companies are seeking to acquire Chinese technology by buying stakes in Chinese startups, and many countries, ranging from Spain and Brazil to Indonesia, are competing to attract Chinese investment in the automotive and battery sectors. They’ve decided that strategic collaboration is more likely to strengthen their long-term competitiveness than isolation. Even Tesla, the U.S. EV manufacturer, relies on batteries developed with CATL, the Chinese battery manufacturer and technology company, for its Chinese-made vehicles, which are exported to Europe and other parts of the world.

If the United States doesn’t recommit to new-generation vehicle development, the result could be one where in just a few years U.S. consumers may go on vacation abroad and discover that their rental car or taxi is running on a technology that looks different and is in many ways more attractive than what is available at home. This problematic outcome would not be determined by an inherent lack of U.S. ingenuity, but rather because the U.S. market is simply not large or competitive enough to sustain the type of innovation that will be needed in the coming years. Chinese companies have been evolving at breakneck speed and rapidly expanding their global market share, leading governments and companies around the world to rethink their automotive strategy for the future. Undermining the companies that are trying to develop domestic value chains today will mean cutting off the most effective pathway to technological leadership tomorrow.

Thanks to tariffs and restrictions based on national security grounds, the United States is a well-protected market. But settling for no competition at all will lead to stagnation in the long term. The United States should evaluate whether it wants to be associated with old technology rather than the forefront of innovation, as it had traditionally been. U.S. companies and research institutions have remarkably advanced technology, but they will be unlikely to commercialize it if there is no market domestically. This is in practice what already happened with EVs and lithium-ion batteries, including lithium iron phosphate batteries, which were invented in the United States, but today Chinese firms excel in.

To move forward, Congress and the Trump administration should consider U.S. strategic interests and the direction of technological innovation globally before drawing conclusions based on short-term domestic trends alone. Policies to localize more of the supply chain and encourage the development of diversified supply chains for critical minerals and components like batteries should still be a U.S. priority. Killing the U.S. EV market and politicizing EVs will not strengthen the United States’ innovation ecosystem, although it will likely succeed in isolating it from the rest of the world.

That’s a long-debated issue that President Donald Trump has pushed back into the spotlight thanks to his effort to expand nuclear power in the United States.

Last week, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at easing the construction of new nuclear reactors, which the administration says will provide electricity needed to avoid shortages and power data centers used by artificial intelligence. In addition to taking steps to enable the construction of nuclear plants on public lands and expand U.S. uranium mining, the orders call for revisiting technical models the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) uses to set exposure limits for ionizing radiation, which can cause cancer and other health problems.

Some nuclear power proponents have argued NRC’s safety models have led to regulations that are too strict and costly to implement, creating a barrier to nuclear power. And in its 23 May announcement, the White House asserted, “Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels. … Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion.”

The move to revisit the safety models promises to reignite an often fierce, decades-old scientific battle over the risks posed by radiation—and whether small doses might even have positive health effects.

Here’s some background:

Why is Trump targeting NRC?

The White House claims the agency, established in 1975 to oversee nuclear safety, has become an obstacle to approving new reactors. Since 1978, NRC has only approved five new reactors, and just two have been built: the Unit 3 and Unit 4 reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia. In contrast, 133 reactors were constructed in the U.S. over the previous 26 years. Currently, there are 94 operating reactors at 54 commercial power plants in 28 states. They generate about 19% of the nation’s electricity.

In a bid to promote new plant construction, Trump wants to downsize and reorganize NRC and require it to make final decisions on applications for new reactors within 18 months. The agency would get 12 months to act on requests to continue the operations of an existing reactor.

What safety models are at issue?

Radiation risks are mostly calculated from studies that examined cancer cases among 86,600 survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War II. Researchers found that the incidence of cancer in the survivors rose linearly—in a straight line—with the radiation dose. That suggests there’s no threshold below which exposure to radiation is harmless. Scientists call this the linear no-threshold (LNT) model of ionizing radiation. The LNT model is widely accepted in the scientific community and informs almost all regulation of the U.S. nuclear industry, including an NRC standard that calls for keeping radiation exposure “as low as reasonably achievable.”

There are critics of the LNT model, however. They point to a body of research on cells and animals, as well as epidemiology studies, that suggest radiation exposure below a certain threshold is safe and can even improve human health, an idea known as hormesis. In 2015, three members of a group called Scientists for Accurate Radiation Information cited the hormesis theory in petitions asking NRC to increase allowable doses for nuclear workers and the public. (One of the group’s missions is to prevent “radiation-phobia-related deaths,” according to its website.)

In 2021, NRC rejected the petitions, finding insufficient evidence to justify any changes. The agency noted the “actual level of risk associated with low doses of radiation remains uncertain,” but “there is not strong support for the hormesis concept in the scientific literature.” It also cited a 2005 report on low-dose radiation risks from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which is still considered one the most authoritative reviews of the issue. It concluded that the LNT model “continues to provide a sound regulatory basis for minimizing the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure.”

What happens next?

The Trump administration—which includes officials who have in the past called for less strict radiation standards and endorsed the hormesis concept—has ordered NRC to adopt new “science-based radiation limits” within 18 months. “In particular, the NRC shall reconsider reliance on the [LNT model] … and the ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ standard,” the executive order states.

The White House has asked NRC to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy and Defense in developing the new standards, which will likely be subject to a formal rulemaking that involves inviting comments from the public. Any final rules could then be subject to legal challenges, including claims that they violate a provision of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act that requires NRC to “minimize danger to life or property.”

What’s been the reaction to the executive orders?

The nuclear industry has welcomed Trump’s move. Maria Korsnick, CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group, thanked Trump during a White House event that featured him signing the orders. In a statement, Ur-Energy, a uranium mining company, applauded Trump’s “bold action … to return the U.S. to its leadership role in the nuclear sector.”

Some groups that see nuclear power as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels also offered praise. The call to reconsider the LNT model and other safety standards is a positive step toward reforming NRC’s “overly risk-averse culture, structure, and regulations,” wrote Adam Stein, director of the nuclear energy innovation program at the Breakthrough Institute, a nonprofit research organization.

Others are wary of the proposed regulatory changes. Trump’s order to revise exposure rules “flies in the face of globally held radiation safety standards,” says health researcher Stephen Bondy of the University of California Irvine, author of a 2023 review paper that found the science on hormesis is still unsettled. It “clearly places health hazards as of secondary importance relative to economic and business interests.”",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zvtbmij/abs/_20250523_on_trump_nuclear_power.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:50.955300

Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, citing urgent reliability concerns for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid as the Midwest braces for peak summer electricity demand.
“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” it states.
Consumers Energy, meanwhile, is directed to pursue cost recovery through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
“It will ensure the power generation availability in the region does not dip below 2024 capacity levels,” the agency said on Friday.","The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued an emergency order to delay the closure of Consumer Energy’s 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, citing urgent reliability concerns for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid as the Midwest braces for peak summer electricity demand.

The rare order, issued May 23 by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, compels Consumers Energy and MISO to keep the three-unit subcritical coal-fired facility operational through Aug. 21, 2025—three months past its planned May 31, 2025, shutdown. Unlike most recent 202(c) emergency orders, which have responded to active grid emergencies like hurricanes or extreme weather and focused on short-term generation dispatch actions, Wright’s order preemptively delays a scheduled coal retirement amid warnings of tight reserve margins in the Midwest.

The order—the first of its kind in the mainland U.S. in recent history—comes a week after Wright invoked Section 202(c) to compel the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to dispatch more than 50 fossil-fueled generation units and accelerate transmission corridor vegetation clearing after two major blackouts underscored the island’s acute reliability crisis. As POWER reported in detail, those May 16 directives followed a full island-wide outage and warned that without immediate intervention, Puerto Rico could face up to 135 days of forced load shedding this summer.

According to the order, the emergency action follows warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment concluded that MISO faces elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls, particularly during August and periods of high demand or low resource output.

MISO, in a statement on May 8, acknowledged the elevated risk “due to the potential for extreme weather events and the continued decline in accredited capacity.” However, it anticipates adequate resources to serve summer demand. Peak demand could reach nearly 123 GW, with about 138 GW of regularly available generation expected across the MISO footprint, it said.

Consumers Energy earlier this month also said it is “prepared to deliver safe, reliable and affordable power to customers across the region throughout the summer.” The utility emphasized that its “integrated energy strategy—featuring a balanced mix of generation sources, preparation and customer programs—ensures that homes and businesses stay powered during peak demand periods.” It added: “Consumers Energy’s forward-looking supply plan features a robust mix of flexible generation resources that continue to evolve through strategic investments, like the acquisition of the Covert facility and recent expansion of the Zeeland Generating Station. We will also continue the operation of the Jackson Generating Station and the Karn 3 and 4 combined cycle units.”

Mandatory Operation and Dispatch Instructions

However, the DOE in its order noted that Michigan has retired about 2,700 MW of coal-fired generation, while its nuclear generation has declined with the decommissioning of Big Rock Point in 1997 and Palisades in 2022. While Palisades is scheduled to restart later in 2025, it will not be available for the summer peak. Campbell’s “retirement would further decrease available dispatchable generation within MISO’s service territory, removing additional such generation along with the other 1,575 MW of natural gas and coal-fired generation that has retired since the summer of 2024,” the order said.

“MISO’s Planning Resource Auction Results for Planning Year 2025-26, released in April 2025, note that for the northern and central zones, which includes Michigan, ‘new capacity additions were insufficient to offset the negative impacts of decreased accreditation, suspensions/retirements and external resources,’” the order notes. “While the results ‘demonstrated sufficient capacity,’ the summer months reflected the ‘highest risk and a tighter supply-demand balance,’ and the results ‘reinforce the need to increase capacity.’”

The order compels both MISO and Consumers Energy to keep the Campbell plant operational and available for dispatch throughout the emergency period. “MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” it states.

‘Economic Dispatch’

To limit cost impacts, the DOE further instructs MISO to “take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” That generally means that while the plant will not be expected to run continuously, it must be ready to generate power whenever needed. Economic dispatch allows grid operators to prioritize the use of the plant only when it is more cost-effective than alternatives, helping reduce financial strain on consumers.

While authorizing emergency use, the order also acknowledges potential conflicts with environmental rules. “Operation is limited to the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” it says, and the plant must comply with environmental laws “to the maximum extent practicable while operating consistent with the emergency conditions.”

Under the order’s timeframe, MISO will be expected to report daily to the DOE on the plant’s operational status and compliance and submit a full update by June 15 outlining all steps taken to ensure availability, environmental mitigation, and any operational issues. Consumers Energy, meanwhile, is directed to pursue cost recovery through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The DOE explicitly noted that “Consumers Energy is directed to seek necessary tariff revisions or waivers at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for cost recovery, as allowed under the Federal Power Act.”

According to the DOE, the move is in line with President Trump’s January 2025 declaration of a national energy emergency. “It will ensure the power generation availability in the region does not dip below 2024 capacity levels,” the agency said on Friday.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Secretary Wright said. “This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies to threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jh-campbell-complex-waterway-descriptor3.png,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:56.662296

The jury is still out on whether the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped contain or reduce inflation. Nevertheless, certain provisions have delivered tangible benefits that deserve closer examination before any potential repeal. While some provisions may not have broad appeal, one success of the IRA has been its impact on strengthening U.S. energy production. The bill speaks more to renewable energy innovation and increase in energy independence to support U.S. economic growth than to direct economic impact. Repealing it wholesale risks far more than we might anticipate.

At its core, the IRA tax credits for energy generation are driving significant investment in innovative energy production. Because renewable energy makes up around 21.4% of the energy mix, these incentives have been passed down the chain to the benefits of the ratepayer, while simultaneously sustaining the creation of entire industries. These investments have sparked construction and manufacturing jobs across both red and blue states, proving that clean energy isn’t just an environmental initiative.

These tax credits have also bolstered America’s energy independence. Renewables like solar, onshore wind and offshore wind are integral to our domestic energy supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources, and making our own infrastructure more resilient. They’ve also driven initiatives to improve long-term cost competitiveness, incentivizing developers to innovate to reduce costs.

Our current grid infrastructure and energy generation systems are nearing obsolescence and over the next decade the demand on these systems is expected to skyrocket. Data centers alone are expected to double their electricity demand, and by 2035, over 71 million electric vehicles will require around 400 kWh to charge per month. Urbanization trends are compounding this demand as more people move to cities.

Without the IRA tax credits, we risk slowing down our ability to develop more power generation, growing the risk of rolling blackouts and higher energy costs for the average ratepayer, all while increasing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Today’s decisions don’t impact today’s costs, they impact tomorrow’s ability to grow our economy.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the Internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Renewable energy is no exception.

Since the IRA has been enacted, the renewable energy industry has created thousands of jobs and established numerous domestic manufacturing plants on U.S. soil spurred by these domestic supply tax credit incentives. Manufacturing isn’t the only business reaping these benefits either. These credits have helped support better-paying jobs in specialized professions such as those in the maritime industry for offshore wind or wind technician positions.

Energy diversity isn’t just good economics — it’s a good security policy. With a diverse mix of energy sources (nuclear, fuel based, hydro, renewable), we reduce the risk of monopolies that drive up costs, as seen with Standard Oil’s monopoly in the early 20th century. Competition forces developers to lower costs, driving the cost of energy downwards. Furthermore, the energy has to come from somewhere and the question is not about the current costs of renewable energy but the future cost of energy in general to consumers without renewables in the energy mix of the future. There is nothing more damaging than energy you need but can’t find.

From a national security perspective, energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. If one source is cut off, others can fill the gap, ensuring a stable energy supply and reducing our reliance on adversarial nations for critical resources. Not only are we safer from attack, but we are also responsible for our own generation. This further helps reduce costs, but also prevents us from being beholden to other countries, especially our adversaries, for energy and tangential resources such as rare minerals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Hv8PCyQkZi0Q_aXEa5Bbam_cDvRz6BlNQ8WwJzkdND8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDEyMTQ2Mzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:21.939452

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford on Thursday sounded the alarm on the potential for Washington to do away with production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.

The disappearance of the credits would threaten Ford's investment in a Marshall, Michigan, plant. ""If it doesn't stay, it will imperil what we do in Marshall,"" Ford said at a policy conference in the state.

“We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place. It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made,” he said.

The tax-reform bill passed by the House of Representatives this month could bar lucrative tax credits for batteries produced using Chinese technology. Ford’s factory, now under construction, would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. Since the automaker announced the plant in 2023, it has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

Trump Administration Trade and Tariff Policies

Foley & Lardner provided an overview for multinational companies regarding the most common False Claims Act risks that may arise from improper management of import operations.

A May 28 ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade suspended a significant portion of the Trump administration’s tariffs, after the panel determined the executive branch had wrongfully invoked an emergency law to justify the levies. The Trump administration has requested a stay and appealed the ruling.

The Department of Commerce on May 20 issued the “procedures for submission of documentation related to automobile tariffs,” for automobile importers to comply with the process of identifying the amount of U.S. content in each model imported into the United States. The agency stated there were roughly 200 repeat importers of subject automobiles in 2024. The notice indicated there are 13 OEMs with automobile operations in Canada and Mexico, with production spanning 54 vehicle model lines.

The Commerce Department on May 20 announced preliminary determinations that active anode material produced in China is unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government, which could lead to anti-subsidy duties on imports. The agency expects to issue final determinations in countervailing duty (CVD) investigations later this year. Active anode material is a key component in lithium-ion batteries.

China began issuing a limited number of export licenses for certain rare earth magnets, following weeks of uncertainty after the nation imposed trade restrictions over certain rare earth minerals and magnets in early April. The magnets are essential for a range of auto components.

Section 232 tariffs will not help the United States diversify its sources of critical minerals and reduce its reliance on China, according to a recent letter from the National Association of Manufacturers to the Commerce Department. The NAM suggested policymakers should instead pursue permitting reforms, secure favorable trade and investment terms with international allies, and enact strategic incentives to enhance domestic production. China mines roughly 70% of the world’s rare earths, and the nation has a 90% share for the processing of rare earths mined worldwide.

President Trump on May 25 stated the U.S. will delay implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union from June 1 until July 9, 2025.

Automotive Key Developments

In a May 29 Society of Automotive Analysts Coffee Break webinar, Ann Marie Uetz of Foley & Lardner and Steven Wybo of Riveron provided an overview of the mounting risk of EV programs and the resulting key takeaways for automotive suppliers.

Crain’s Detroit provided an update regarding the status of several ongoing legal disputes between Stellantis and certain suppliers.

MEMA survey data found three-quarters of automotive suppliers expect worse financial performances in 2025 than previously anticipated. In addition, more than half of the trade group’s members are concerned about sub-tier supplier financial distress resulting from higher tariff-related costs, as well as the potential for North American production volumes to fall as low as 13.9 million to 14.3 million this year.

U.S. new light-vehicles sales are projected to reach a SAAR of 15.6 million units in May, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData. The analysis estimates “approximately 149,000 extra vehicles were sold” in March and April ahead of the expectation for higher prices due to tariffs, and the “re-timed sales will present a headwind to the industry sales pace for the balance of this year.”

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration submitted its interpretive rule, “Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program,” to the White House for review. The Environmental Protection Agency is pursuing parallel vehicle emissions rules.

The U.S. Senate on May 22 approved three House-passed Congressional Review Act resolutions to revoke EPA-granted waivers that allowed California to impose vehicle emissions standards that were stricter than federal regulations.

The “big, beautiful” tax and budget bill passed by the U.S. House on May 22 would terminate several tax credits for EVs after December 31, 2025, including commercial EVs under Section 45W, consumer credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs under Section 30D and up to $4,000 in consumer credits for used EVs under Section 25E, as well as a credit for charging infrastructure under Section 30C. The bill also included a measure to establish annual registration fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles to supplement the Highway Trust Fund.

Companies that collect and store personal data will soon have to comply with a Department of Justice rule that restricts sharing bulk sensitive personal data with persons from China, Russia, Iran, and other countries identified as foreign adversaries. The Data Security Program implemented by the National Security Division (NSD) under Executive Order 14117 took effect April 8, 2025. However, the DOJ will not prioritize enforcement actions between April 8 and July 8, 2025 if a company is “engaging in good faith efforts” towards compliance.

While President Trump expressed approval for a “planned partnership” between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, questions remain about the timeline for the proposed $14 billion merger first announced in December 2023. The deal may involve a so-called “golden share,” allowing the U.S. federal government to weigh in on certain company decisions, according to unconfirmed reports.

The University of Michigan predicted U.S. vehicle prices could rise 13.2% on average, or by $6,200 per vehicle, due to tariffs and retaliatory trade policies.

OEMs/Suppliers

Plante Moran’s annual North American Automotive OEM – Supplier Working Relations Index® (WRI®) Study found supplier relationships improved with Toyota, Honda and GM, and declined with Nissan, Ford and Stellantis compared to last year’s study. Toyota gained 18 points for its highest WRI score since 2007, while Stellantis dropped 11 points and remains in last place.

Stellantis named Antonio Filosa as CEO, effective June 23. Filosa currently serves as chief operating officer for the Americas and chief quality officer.

GM will invest $888 million to produce next-generation V-8 engines at its Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, NY, representing the largest single investment the automaker has ever made in an engine plant. The automaker canceled a $300 million investment to retool the plant to manufacture EV drive units.

Toyota will revise its supply chain process to provide 52-week forecasts using cloud-based forecasting tools.

Bosch has a goal for North America to represent 20% of its global sales by 2030.

Toyota is reported to be considering a compact pickup truck for the U.S. market to compete with the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz.

Market Trends and Regulatory

Ford will recall over one million vehicles in the U.S. due to a software error that may cause the rearview camera image to delay, freeze, or not display.

Installations of industrial robots in the automotive industry in 2024 rose 11% year-over-year to 13,700 units, and roughly 40% of all new industrial robot installations in 2024 were in automotive, according to preliminary analysis from the International Federation of Robotics. Deployments of automation technologies and robotics are expected to increase at U.S. factories in response to high tariffs and trade uncertainty.

Seventy-six percent of respondents in Kerrigan Advisors’ 2025 OEM Survey believe Chinese carmakers eventually will enter the U.S. market, and 70% are concerned about the impact of Chinese brands’ rising global market share.

New orders for heavy-duty trucks in North America fell 48% year-over-year in April to levels not seen since the onset of the Covid pandemic, according to ACT Research.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

The Wall Street Journal provided an exclusive report on allegations that now-defunct San Diego-headquartered autonomous truck developer TuSimple shared sensitive data with various partners in China. The former CEO of TuSimple recently founded Houston-based self-driving truck developer Bot Auto.

Amazon’s Zoox plans to expand testing of its autonomous driving technology in Atlanta. Waymo offers driverless rides in Atlanta in partnership with Uber, and Lyft plans to roll out ride-hail services in the area with May Mobility later this year.

The New York Times provided an assessment of the regulatory and market risks that may complicate the rollout of driverless semi trucks in the U.S.

Swedish driverless truck startup Einride is considering a U.S. IPO.

Electric Vehicles and Low-Emissions Technology

Honda reduced its planned all-electric vehicle investments by over $20 billion as part of an electrification strategy realignment that will target 2.2 million hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) sales by 2030.

Stellantis will delay production of its 2026 base-model electric Dodge Charger Daytona at its plant in Ontario due to uncertainty over market demand and the impact of tariffs.

Cox Automotive estimated inventory levels for new EVs reached a 99 days’ supply industrywide in April 2025, representing a YOY decline of 20% due to efforts by automakers to adjust production in response to consumer demand. The average transaction price (ATP) for a new EV was $59,255 in April, up 3.7% compared to April 2024.

Nissan is considering a deal to procure EV batteries in the U.S. from a joint venture between Ford and South Korea’s SK On, according to unnamed sources in Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal.

“I find it hard to believe that over the next few years, we’ll end up in a place where the president can fire independent commissioners at will without congressional intervention,” he said. “Even if it’s only through the confirmation process, I expect lawmakers will push back to preserve agency independence…”

“FERC’s core job, today and historically, is ratemaking, which is legislative in nature,” Chandler said. “Further, FERC has routinely consisted of subject matter experts who improve in their duties based on the experience they gain in their respective positions. I can’t think of an agency that more encapsulates the tenets of Humphrey’s Executor…”

But the implications go beyond internal decision-making and into the public arena, Chandler with R Street said.

“Any executive in the country would be crazy to want to change the paradigm from an independent agency setting rates to giving even the appearance that they dictate the agency’s actions,” Chandler said. “One of the primary jobs of FERC is to set wholesale rates, and if commissioners can be fired at will, then every time a rate hike happens, people will blame the president.”

Chandler emphasized that this perception — even if not backed by reality — could be politically damaging and destabilize trust in regulatory outcomes.

“Appearance is all that matters,” he said. “That’s a terrible scenario for individual consumers and for the American economy.”",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yoest-facebook-share-default.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:19.664927

In its latest announcement, the EPA signaled a move toward greater flexibility for public water systems in meeting compliance requirements, emphasizing its dual goals of protecting public health and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable, particularly for smaller water systems.
It remains crucial for water systems to continue assessing their water sources for PFAS and to plan for necessary treatment and compliance measures, keeping the new timelines in mind.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced it will maintain the current National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for the two most common per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PFOA and PFOS. It will also rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for several other PFAS, including PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), a Hazard Index mixture involving those three compounds and PFBS.

These changes include several plans that could make it easier for public water systems to comply with federal drinking water standards.

The EPA's latest announcement follows the establishment of final National Primary Drinking Water Regulations on April 10, 2024. The standards set legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for these PFAS. These regulations establish nationwide limits for these persistent ""forever chemicals"" in public drinking water. They apply to ""public water systems,"" defined as any publicly or privately owned system providing water for human consumption that has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days per year.

The EPA initially gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with these MCLs, which many criticized as infeasible. In its latest announcement, the EPA signaled a move toward greater flexibility for public water systems in meeting compliance requirements, emphasizing its dual goals of protecting public health and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable, particularly for smaller water systems.

The latest move also follows the EPA’s newly released guidance to help states address PFAS discharges into water sources, which can result in the contamination of drinking water.

The EPA outlined several new initiatives aimed at supporting water systems:

Extended compliance deadlines: The EPA plans to initiate a rulemaking process to extend the compliance deadline for the PFOA and PFOS MCLs to 2031.

Federal exemption framework: The EPA intends to establish a federal exemption framework, offering a structured approach for systems needing more time or facing unique challenges.

PFAS OUT Initiative: A new program, the PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT), will engage utilities, technical assistance providers, and local, state, tribal, and territorial leaders to develop practical and effective solutions, with a particular focus on rural and small communities.

The EPA's decision to maintain PFOA and PFOS standards while also providing extended compliance timelines and new support mechanisms offers a degree of certainty combined with necessary flexibility for public water systems.

Water systems and other stakeholders should stay informed about the upcoming rulemaking process for the extended compliance deadlines and the development of the federal exemption framework. They should also take advantage of the resources and engagement opportunities that will be available through the PFAS OUTreach Initiative.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot.
Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean.","Li-Cycle once seemed like a leader among the startups trying to recycle electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. Now it’s mired in bankruptcy proceedings.

The company’s board replaced the CEO and CFO in a decision announced May 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was looking for buyers. A potential deal with mining giant and lead creditor Glencore evidently had not come to fruition: Two weeks later, a Canadian bankruptcy court appointed Alvarez & Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has loaned $10.5 million to keep things going during the proceedings. Glencore also entered a ​“stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the $275 million it previously invested in Li-Cycle.

“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez & Marsal pitch in a flyer for the sale.

That ​“compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general. A few years ago, the sector was flush with venture capital and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs while minimizing mining. The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.

Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.

Li-Cycle successfully built five ​“spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.

The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June.

The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office finalized a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle never drew on that federal money because it couldn’t secure additional private funding to hold in reserve, as stipulated in the loan terms.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

The adjacent U.S. EV sector has seen slower growth than expected, which has in turn reduced the urgency of building out a North American battery supply chain. Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean. And battery makers have increasingly turned to lithium iron phosphate, a cheaper alternative to nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries, further reducing the value of recycling these batteries.

New supply-chain ‘passports’ pave the way for more recycling of EV batteries

In the past year, a fire destroyed the largest battery shredding plant in the U.S., Interco’s Critical Mineral Recovery site in Missouri. Reno, Nevada–based Aqua Metals ran low on funds and laid off staff while it searched for financing to build a commercial-scale recycling line. Ascend Elements delayed construction of its flagship recycling plant in Kentucky, citing a customer’s decision to postpone buying the recycled materials. In March, Ascend canceled plans to make cathode active materials in Kentucky to focus on precursor materials and lithium carbonate.

Redwood Materials is the rare bright spot. The venture by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel raised a couple billion dollars and has been building out a major compound in the desert outside Reno, not far from Tesla’s factory there. In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.

The industry’s challenges come as the Trump administration says it aims to expand U.S. mineral supplies. Paradoxically, the administration has taken steps to undermine the fledgling U.S. EV and battery industries, which are the big drivers of demand growth for rare earth metals. The budget bill passed by the House last week would strip tax incentives for EV purchases and battery installations, weakening demand for the domestic supply chain that recyclers like Li-Cycle hoped to serve — and making the tough road for recycling firms even tougher.",https://www.corporateknights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Li-Cycle2.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:24.192763

SALT LAKE CITY — Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the University of Utah has been selected to receive $2 million in Brownfields Grants to assess, cleanup and revitalize local lands.

“The Brownfields program is about turning opportunity into action, and the University of Utah has done exactly that,” said Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western. “This funding is a smart use of resources that reflects our commitment to both economic growth and environmental responsibility.”

Previous environmental site assessments conducted by the University of Utah at the SLC Station Center have identified harmful contamination on the property such as arsenic and volatile organic compounds. The University plans on remediating the soil and groundwater contamination for future commercial reuse in alignment with Salt Lake City’s Community Revitalization Agency’s Rio Grande Plan.

These grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants nationally announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This funding put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfields Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, Brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

NuScale sought approval for the 77 MW design to improve economics and performance of its planned small modular reactors (SMRs), after having originally received NRC approval in 2020 for a 50 MW reactor design.

SMRs are designed to be built in factories with relatively easily replicated parts instead of onsite like conventional nuclear power plants. Backers say the reactors will be safer to operate, their uranium cycles will be more resistant to access from militants seeking to obtain fissile materials, and their modular aspect will reduce costs for multiple plants.

SMR critics say they will be more expensive to operate than conventional reactors, which have larger reactors, and they will continue to produce radioactive waste for which the U.S. has no permanent repository.

NuScale is the only U.S. company with an approved design, but reaching the point of building a plant has been elusive. In 2023 NuScale axed its first project with a Utah municipal power group, despite a U.S. government promise of $1.35 billion in funding over 10 years for the plant, known as the Carbon Free Power Project. As costs rose, several towns had pulled out of the project.

John Hopkins, NuScale’s president and chief executive, said Thursday’s approval, which came two months earlier than had been expected, allows the company to construct and operate a plant.

“We now have an American technology that is near-term deployable,” Hopkins said. As many as 12 of the 77 MW reactors can be put together in a plant, he said, which would be about the size of a typical conventional reactor.

Hopkins said the company could have an SMR in operation by the end of the decade if a customer moves quickly. “It’s really in the customer’s hands.”

NuScale shares were down 3.9% at $33.96 in afternoon trade.

Interest in nuclear energy has spiked as U.S. power demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in so-called hyper-scalers building data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

Last week President Donald Trump signed four executive orders aiming to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including reducing staffing levels in some offices. The orders also directed the Energy and Defense departments to work together to build nuclear plants on federal lands.

The orders did not direct any new public funding but could open the way for financing from the Loan Programs Office.

Hopkins said NuScale is in talks to build SMRs with five “tier one hyper-scalers that we have non-disclosure agreements with.” He did not identify them.

(WZMQ) – The state of Michigan has launched a new partnership with DTE Energy and Consumers Energy aimed at boosting in-state manufacturing and accelerating clean energy job growth.

(WZMQ) – The state of Michigan has launched a new partnership with DTE Energy and Consumers Energy aimed at boosting in-state manufacturing and accelerating clean energy job growth.

Announced Wednesday at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference, the utilities have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually to purchase equipment, technology, and services from Michigan-based suppliers, $2 billion from DTE, and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy. Jonathan Smith, Senior Chief Deputy Director with the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO), said this will create a massive opportunity for michigan manufacturers to make more of the things utilities are going to need to buy to build out a new and more reliable energy grid over the next decade.

Though the partnership is between the two largest utilities in the lower peninsula, the plan is to eventually expand to include smaller utilities.

“We’re starting with the state’s two largest investor-owned utilities because they have so much scale. It allows us to aggregate this demand and create real market opportunities for manufacturers.” Smith said. “Our next step from here is to go out to municipal energy utilities around the state, bring them into this partnership as well.”

He emphasized that the search for manufacturers will also target businesses across the state, looking for new businesses that arent in the energy supply chain yet to give them a chance to move into the market and grow their businesses.

“Even if you’re not in one of these service areas, say you’re a manufacturer or a business, we are going to look at reaching out to businesses across the state who have the right capabilities to make some of this equipment, to help them move into these supply chains,” Smith said. “We think Michigan is already a leading state for the energy industry, and we can really grow that through this partnership with our utilities.”

The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s Community & Worker Economic Transition Office is coordinating the effort, which includes the launch of the MI Hub for Manufacturers. The Hub will offer digital tools, expert advice, capital access, and funding opportunities to make sure small and mid-sized manufacturers have the tools they need to grow their business.

“We have these amazing organizations all over the state. There’s the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, there’s Automation Alley, there are small business development centers. These are resources that every business in the state has access to, but they can be hard to find.” Smith said. “This web resource is going to allow you to quickly find all of the different services and programs that can help you grow your business. And it will also help you if you need multiple services from multiple providers, you’ll be able to get a plan that’s right for you in one place that might involve working with multiple different entities. It’s going to make it easier for business owners to get support, to get help, and to learn about tools they might not know exist.”

DTE and Consumers Energy will work with the state to find and support Michigan-based suppliers that are manufacturing the needed solar components, long-duration battery storage systems, transformers, and other new energy technologies. Smith said the initiative is also aimed at helping utilities meet reliability and resiliency goals while controlling costs for ratepayers.

The MI Hub for Manufacturers is expected to help businesses retool facilities and retain employees as new work becomes available through utility contracts. Partners designing the platform say it demonstrates how government, philanthropy, and industry can work together to deliver practical value to small and mid-sized businesses.",https://wzmq19.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2023-10-17-225800.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:36.087920

The House bill does terminate several IRA energy credits, including some related to cars and homes at the end of this year.
The home related credits that will be terminated are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, Residential Clean Energy Credit, and the Energy Efficient Home Credit.","Many of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit reforms that exist in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act comes through early phaseouts of these credits instead of immediate repeal.

A 2025 study by the Cato Institute found that the IRA energy subsidies could cost up to $4.7 trillion by 2050. Of these provisions, the ones that were likely to cost the most in the long run were the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit. These credits were initially not set to expire until the later of a certain emissions threshold or 2032. As the threshold will not be reached for quite some time, if ever, this is essentially an uncapped subsidy. Under the House version of the reconciliation bill, these credits will begin phasing down in 2029 and phase out by 2032. In 2029, they will be 80 percent of their current level, then 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and 0 percent after December 31, 2032.

The bill also phases out the 45X Manufacturing Credit by December 31, 2031, and restricts it from applying to foreign entities two years after the bill’s enactment.

Phasing out tax credits simply kicks the can down the road, allowing dependency on the credits to grow and market distortions to continue. There is also a risk that these credits will be extended later, as we point out in a recent CEI report:

Further, half-measures like phasing out the subsidies are unacceptable in part because the subsidies may never actually get repealed. They will just stick around until they can be extended. Such an approach also continues and increases the dependency on the subsidies, making it harder to get rid of them due to special interests becoming even more invested in defending them.

A recent piece from the Institute for Energy Research makes a similar argument:

Time and again, subsidy mechanisms like tax credits and production mandates are introduced with specific expiration dates or phase-down schedules, framed as temporary boosts for nascent technologies or short-term solutions to specific problems. Yet, history shows these policies are not temporary, with Congress granting “temporary” extensions year after year after year.

Leaving these credits in place for several more years runs the risk of them never truly going away. Phasing out these credits isn’t undoing the Green New Deal. It may or may not be a small step forward, but regardless, it isn’t nearly what is needed.

The House bill does terminate several IRA energy credits, including some related to cars and homes at the end of this year. The car credits provisions that will be terminated are the: Clean Vehicle Credit, Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit, Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit.

The home related credits that will be terminated are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, Residential Clean Energy Credit, and the Energy Efficient Home Credit.

The House took some first steps in addressing these tax credits, but much more still needs to be done. If Republicans genuinely want to kill off the Green New Deal and advance sound energy policy, the Senate should go much further than the House and terminate these credits as opposed to merely phasing them out.

Ultimately, full repeal of the IRA’s energy provisions will be necessary to repair the damage that’s been done to our energy policy and to stop the costly spending.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1328805329-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:11:20.926405

The company will lean on exports and hybrid dominance as a buffer against slower-than-expected EV adoption in the American market.

A new battery factory in North Carolina will power the strategy, producing up to 300,000 EV batteries annually at full capacity.

Toyota Motor Corp. has been moving cautiously on electric vehicle (EV) production but it is shifting gears. It's preparing to launch two U.S.-made all-electric models next year, adding to its growing lineup of EVs and signaling a deeper investment in electrification — even as it hedges with hybrids and global exports.

By mid-2027, Toyota aims to offer seven EV models in U.S. showrooms. That includes two American-built vehicles, three imports arriving next year, and two already on the market: the bZ4X (soon to be renamed “bZ”) and the Lexus RZ.

Export strategy as market insurance

Toyota executives remain wary about EV demand in the U.S., where battery electric vehicles accounted for just 8% of sales in 2024. Toyota sold fewer than 30,000 fully electric cars domestically last year — a fraction of competitors like Tesla and Hyundai.

To manage risk, the automaker plans to tap overseas markets to absorb potential U.S. oversupply. It typically only adds a vehicle to a factory lineup if confident in 100,000–150,000 units in annual sales, meaning export flexibility is key.

That outlook could be complicated by geopolitical factors. Any trade conflict sparked by President Trump’s proposed tariffs could disrupt Toyota’s international supply and export plans.

Battery power from the heartland

At the core of Toyota’s electrification strategy is a sprawling battery facility in Liberty, North Carolina. Spanning 1,850 acres, the plant will begin shipping lithium-ion cells later this year. Ten of its 14 production lines are dedicated to EV batteries, with the rest focused on hybrids.

When fully operational, the site will support the production of more than 30 gigawatt-hours annually — enough to power 800,000 hybrid vehicles, 150,000 plug-in hybrids, and 300,000 all-electric vehicles.

The factory’s first hybrid battery line is expected to come online next month, with additional lines launching through 2034.

U.S. plants gear up for EV transition

Toyota’s two major American factories are also pivoting:

Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota’s largest global plant, will host one of the new electric models. It currently produces top-selling vehicles like the Camry (now hybrid-only), the RAV4 (soon ending gasoline-only versions), and the Lexus ES.

Princeton, Indiana, where large models like the Highlander, Grand Highlander, and Sienna are built, will produce another new EV model — though Toyota hasn’t disclosed what it will be.

Meanwhile, three new imported EVs will hit U.S. dealerships next year: the bZ Woodland, a new CH-R crossover, and an all-electric version of the Lexus ES.

Catching up without giving in

Toyota’s strategy reflects both urgency and restraint. Once a skeptic of aggressive EV mandates, the company has become more vocal about letting the market dictate pace.

For now, Toyota’s hybrid dominance — with nearly 80% of U.S. sales already electrified in some form — provides a strong foundation. But as the EV era accelerates, Toyota’s new investment signals it’s no longer content to trail the pack.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/lexusrz-ca-2025.webp,N,,2025-05-29 16:12:28.208839

Lawrenceville, Ill. — May 28, 2025 — Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA’s Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company’s broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)’s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

“This project is a testament to what’s possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,” said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. “From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we’re proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.”

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL’s manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA’s largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

“We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we’re taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,” said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. “We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.”

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We’re proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project’s final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

“This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,” said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. “Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.”

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA’s own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an “energy community,” designated due to the area’s unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

“From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,” said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. “The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.”

Since The Inflation Reduction Act Passed Three Years Ago, NY Companies Have Announced Over $5 BILLION In Clean Manufacturing Investments Creating Thousands Of Good-Paying Jobs From Long Island To Buffalo; Senator Warns What Will Happen If GOP Doesn’t Back Off Plan To Kill Clean Energy And Manufacturing

Schumer: Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Is An Ugly Mess That Means Bigger Electric Bills & Big Job Losses For New York

Just a week after House Republicans passed Trump’s devastating bill to kill clean energy incentives so they could give tax breaks to billionaires, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer revealed how tax hikes on clean energy tucked in the bill would be a gut punch to New York’s economy.

Schumer said new data studies from NERA Economic Consulting shows that repealing the clean energy tax credits could cause New York to lose up to 20,300 jobs as clean energy projects are cancelled or scaled back due to lack of incentive, with a whopping nearly $3.5 billion hit to the state’s GDP and New Yorkers paying up to $650 in higher energy costs each year by 2032 if these devastating cuts become law.

“Higher energy bills and many thousands fewer jobs, that’s what New York gets under Trump’s reckless tax bill, which is a giveaway to billionaires and corporations. Already, thousands of New Yorkers were making improvements to their homes to lower their electric bills and make their homes warmer in the harsh winters, now they lose all that support. Thousands of new jobs building clean energy projects in every corner of the state and bringing manufacturing back from China will all be vaporized by the GOP's ugly budget bill. It is a gut punch to New York and a gift to China, which wants to dominate clean energy manufacturing,” said Senator Schumer. “Losing these clean energy projects means losing cheaper electricity for families and businesses. We need more energy production from many sources including wind and solar and water; we need America to be energy independent and to manufacture clean energy technology here, not overseas, and eliminating these tax credits radically and irresponsibly rolls back all the progress we have made in recent years. It turns America’s clean energy boom into a bust.”

Schumer explained that the bill which passed the Republican House last week would kill clean energy incentives created in the Inflation Reduction Act, these tax credits are already benefiting hundreds of New York businesses with ongoing projects and families who are using them to help improve their homes and lower their electric bills. These cuts are broad and deep to New York’s clean energy sector, Schumer specifically highlighted how the bill would:

Eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, which provides families in New York up to $3,200 to help weatherize their homes for better protection in the harsh winters and make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient to lower their electric bills with qualifying items like doors, windows, better insulation and heat pumps.

Eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives New York families a 30% discount on home energy improvements, like solar panels, heat pumps, or energy storage, that help lower energy bills and keep the lights on during power outages.

Eliminates the Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits that support more cheap, clean electricity. With natural gas turbines on a five-year delay, the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits have ensured a robust buildout of wind and solar power while helping keep electricity prices from increasing and spurring demand for American-made energy products.

Sabotages the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit that has generated a more than five-fold increase in investment in manufacturing in the solar and EV supply chains, creating thousands of jobs and shifting these industries out of China to the U.S.

Eliminates the IRA’s Electric Vehicle Tax Credits that make it cheaper to buy new and used electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and has led to a massive onshoring of EV and battery supply chain manufacturing, undercutting China and bolstering American companies.

Eliminates the New Energy-Efficient Home Credit that makes it cheaper to build new, highly efficient and affordable homes, expanding the housing supply while reducing energy costs.

Eliminates the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit that supports American-made clean hydrogen, led by New York companies like Plug Power and Air Products, to be used for clean manufacturing and agriculture.

Schumer said that clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act have created the biggest clean energy boom in American history, but now with many of these core provisions being clawed back or eliminated it risks all the progress that has been made in New York and across the country. The senator said if NY energy projects are forced to stop or scale back, energy costs would increase for families and businesses across the country. With electricity demand surging in New York and across the country, clean energy sources like wind and many other sources of clean power are often the most efficient sources of new electricity, much cheaper than traditional alternatives like natural gas and oil. NERA Economic Consulting estimates costs for New York families could increase by $650 a year, as the Republican plan to gut the clean electricity production and investment tax credits makes it more expensive to provide more electricity, while simultaneously killing the Residential Clean Energy and Energy Efficient Home Improvement tax credits makes it more costly for families to make their homes more efficient and reduce their energy bills.

Schumer added, “Democrats are united in opposing this cruel and counterproductive bill, and these ill-conceived elimination of energy tax credits so they can put more money in the pockets of billionaires. We need the GOP to block these cuts, otherwise it will be American families and our manufacturing future paying the price.”

The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives have spurred over $5 billion worth of investments in clean manufacturing in New York, creating over 7,200 jobs. Schumer said if this House Republican plan goes through, many of the clean energy projects spurred by the IRA could be forced to scale back or even stop and the workers building the future of American energy would be laid off, and projects that otherwise would have come online will never come to fruition. That would impact both major NY employers and manufacturers in the clean energy, manufacturing, electric vehicle, battery, research sector and our small businesses. One example is Geothermal Works in the Hudson Valley, a small Westchester based family business with that helps homes get updated with heat pumps and geothermal systems to lower their electric costs, who said that if the current clean energy cuts go through in the GOP bill it would shutter their business and force them into early retirement.

Below are just some examples of projects spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act in New York State that show why eliminating these provisions could be so harmful:

Off Long Island, Equinor invested $5 billion in building a massive offshore wind farm project, Empire Wind, that will provide power for hundreds of thousands of homes in New York State, and is supported by tax credits for offshore wind projects created by the Inflation Reduction Act .

In the Capital Region, Plug Power invested $125 million in a new green hydrogen fuel cell factory in 2023, creating new good paying jobs to boost production of clean hydrogen fuel cells with support from the Fuel Cell Production Tax Credit. Additionally, the company is poised to harness the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, to spur further growth both in the Capital Region and at Plug’s Henrietta, NY Gigafactory in the Finger Lakes that manufactures Electrolyzers. GE Vernova invested $50 million in a new manufacturing line for its onshore wind business in 2023, hiring 200 new workers with support from a production tax credit for U.S. wind turbine manufacturing created by the Inflation Reduction Act.

In Western New York, Viridi Parente a fast growing company on Buffalo’s East Side has added hundreds of good-paying jobs growing the domestic battery manufacturing industry with support from clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act, such as the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. Solar Liberty Energy Systems and PanelClaw are installing thousands of solar panels at homes and businesses. Solar Liberty Energy Systems is helping customers navigate available federal clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the burden of installation costs while PanelClaw is producing racking systems with help from the American Domestic Manufacturing Bonus tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since Trump was elected, approximately $14 billion worth of manufacturing projects have been outright cancelled, representing more than 13,000 jobs lost. If the GOP plan to raise taxes on energy goes through, those cancellations could balloon to threaten more than $800 billion in private investment in domestic clean energy made in the past three years across the country, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. NERA Economic Consulting estimates that New York could lose an estimated 20,300 jobs if these tax breaks are killed. Schumer said the House Republican bill would repeal the very parts of the Inflation Reduction Act that have helped companies grow in New York and spurred millions of investments, many of which are in Republican districts.

Repealing the clean energy tax incentives would also be a disaster for America and Schumer said that would cede energy manufacturing leadership to China, which already produces a significant amount of the world’s clean technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. If companies can no longer support clean energy manufacturing in the United States, they will bring these projects to America’s competitors, and jobs that would’ve otherwise been created in America will be created in countries like China. This will destabilize American supply chains and make American families and businesses reliant on China for cheap energy.

“No matter which way you slice it, the House Republican bill is bad news for New Yorkers. Shutting down projects, killing jobs, and increasing electricity bills would be devastating for our state, which is why we need Republicans to stand up to this bill to save investments in homegrown American energy,” concluded Schumer.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

PurposeEnergy, which specializes in converting organic food waste into energy, has officially opened a high-tech anaerobic digestion facility that began exporting power to the Vermont grid in December 2024. The project broke ground in May 2023 and marks PurposeEnergy’s first big move since being acquired by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners in April 2023. Quinbrook fully funded the St. Albans facility.

A key player in this project is Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont ice cream giant signed a long-term feedstock deal with PurposeEnergy in 2021. Now, all of Ben & Jerry’s high-strength organic waste and out-of-spec food products are sent straight from its factory to the new facility through a dedicated pipeline. The waste is then transformed into clean electricity and clean water.

Other regional food producers are also contributing their waste to PurposeEnergy’s new site. Casella, Wind River Environmental, Evergreen Services, and Carmichael Trucking haul additional feedstocks to help centralize food waste disposal across the region.

“This project strengthens Ben & Jerry’s commitment to environmental sustainability by providing a long-term solution for organic waste,” said Jenna Evans, the company’s global sustainability manager. “It will reduce Vermont’s road traffic, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease phosphorus pollution.”

The plant sits on land purchased from the Franklin County Industrial Development Corporation and is expected to produce 8.75 million kWh of renewable electricity annually. That clean power is sent to the Vermont grid through the state’s Standard Offer program, which supports the deployment of small-scale renewable energy projects.

The plant also recovers up to 45,000 million Btu of renewable thermal energy annually, which helps heat the digester and run operations.

“It’s a model of industrial symbiosis – turning food production waste into clean energy, reducing emissions, and supporting local economies,” said Erik Lallum, PurposeEnergy’s chief development officer.

PurposeEnergy says the new facility could help attract more food manufacturing businesses to the St. Albans Industrial Park by offering a sustainable, onsite waste management solution that doubles as a clean energy source.

The court ruled in favor of an alliance of local counties that support the project, called the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, concluding that the federal environmental review process did not have to consider potential broader, indirect impacts.

The conservative-majority court was unanimous on the bottom line, although the three liberal justices differed on the reasoning. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case.

The court ruled that consideration of broader downstream impacts of the project were not required under a federal law called the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court, said some federal judges have incorrectly applied NEPA and allowed it to be used as a broad weapon to challenge major development projects.

""NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents ... to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,"" he wrote.

This has the effect of delaying projects for years, Kavanaugh said.

""Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line,"" he added. ""Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary.""

Environmental groups that had challenged the railroad's approval decried the ruling, with Sam Sankar, a lawyer at Earthjustice, saying it undermined precedent that said federal agencies should ""look before they leap when approving projects that could harm communities and the environment.""

Although the coalition won at the Supreme Court, the project still has to undergo further review by the federal Surface Transportation Board before it can move forward.

The railroad would bring oil from the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah by connecting the area to the national rail network.

""It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability,"" said Keith Heaton, the coalition's director.

The opposition to the project was led by Eagle County, Colorado, which claims it will suffer from downstream effects of the railroad, and several environmental groups.

The county's lawyers said it would be directly affected by the project, with 9 out of every 10 trains that use the new railroad eventually passing through it on an existing line that runs along the Colorado River.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who also opposes the plan, said in a statement that NEPA should require ""projects to be fully informed of all potential environmental hazards before shovels go into the ground.""

The Surface Transportation Board conducted an environmental review and gave the railroad the green light to move forward.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found flaws in the analysis as well as other parts of the approval process, and in a 2023 ruling sent it back to the agency for further review.

The case arose as NEPA has faced criticism for unnecessarily slowing down major projects.

In 2023, then-President Joe Biden signed new legislation that sought to streamline the process. It requires agencies to only consider ""reasonably foreseeable"" climate impacts and limits reports to 150 pages.

Gorsuch stepped aside after the court had agreed to hear the case, citing the court’s ethics rules. Liberal groups and more than a dozen members of Congress had urged him to recuse himself over his previous links to billionaire Philip Anschutz.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250416-utah-oil-railway-2023-ac-1142p-0d6b0b.jpg",N,,2025-05-29 16:11:24.582118

Climate-friendly trade deals require new rules that reward each country’s transition to a clean energy economy, including the creation of good-paying jobs and environmental protection.","President Trump and his administration are rushing to broker new trade deals and revisit existing ones, unveiling that the real purpose of Trump’s chaotic tariff threats was to open up our jobs and communities to the harmful consequences of more trade rather than trying to bolster American industries.

The administration has announced it is working on new agreements with the United Kingdom, China, and dozens of other countries, including those with terrible records on pollution, human rights, and workers rights, without the input of Congress and the American people. New trade agreements are not the only concern, however. Trump is likely to use the review of the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), to make the deal work even better for corporations and polluters.

We cannot let this secretive approach to trade policy go on. The global trade model is broken. The current rules that govern trade between countries pad the pockets of corporate CEOs while encouraging the exploitation of workers and the environment. Consumers may have more access to “stuff” — but lowering the barriers to global trade has not improved our wellbeing. Decades of bad trade policy led to a decline in American manufacturing and the outsourcing of thousands of good-paying American jobs, while increasing pollution and corporate profiteering overseas.

We need a new model for trade that propels us into the future — one that bolsters environmental protections, provides good-paying jobs, and ensures sustainable supply chains. As the Trump Administration sits down with other countries to hash out new trade deals with the goal of bringing back jobs and securing supply chains, it presents a pivotal opportunity to insist on a new set of guardrails for climate-friendly trade deals that create jobs and protect people and the planet.

The Sierra Club played a pivotal role in speaking up for the environment during the negotiations of the original NAFTA agreement in the early 1900s, and again in speaking up for major reforms to the North American trade pact during the negotiations for the USMCA, aka NAFTA 2.0, during Trump’s first term. Now we’re committed to again fighting alongside you to push for a new model for trade that prioritizes the environment and sustainability to lift up fenceline communities and American jobs.

A vision for climate-friendly trade

So, what exactly does a climate-friendly trade deal look like — one that creates jobs and protects people and the planet? Here are several requirements:

Trade agreements must have binding environmental standards. In most trade deals, governments are “encouraged” to uphold environmental laws in their country, as well as any commitments each country has made under international treaties. However, climate-friendly trade deals must not see environmental protection as optional, but rather as key to prosperity and security. Trade deals must create steadfast commitments that each country protects against pollution and exploitation of the natural world.

Trade agreements must be able to enforce these environmental obligations. The current rules that govern trade deals unfortunately lack any pathways for meaningful enforcement of a trade deal’s environmental provisions, which means that even if an agreement creates environmental obligations on paper, governments can let companies off the hook for meeting strict pollution limits without impacting trade relationships. Enforcement makes environmental obligations stick — and any new or revised trade deals must include strong and meaningful enforcement tools.

Trade agreements must establish common practices and tools to help governments enforce these environmental obligations. In particular, each country must establish and utilize the same standards for reporting on the pollution impacts of individual factories and polluting facilities like power plants. This will ensure any new or revised trade deals can be used as tools to streamline manufacturing processes and modernize economies, including how countries make essential goods, produce energy, and move things from place to place. Climate-friendly trade deals must require cooperation and coordination on pollution reporting so all countries operate from a common understanding.

Trade agreements should reward innovators. Our outdated trade model has allowed companies to move their manufacturing to countries where the cost of doing business is cheapest.This process is known as “offshoring” jobs and pollution, and it rewards countries whose industries lean on cheap and outdated manufacturing practices and exploitative supply chains. Tools like pollution dumping fees — require importers to pay an additional fee on particularly pollution-intensive goods — can help ensure that companies that take financial risks to modernize have a fair shot in the global marketplace. Climate-friendly trade deals must incentivize industries to advance, not encourage industries to stagnate.

Trade partners must agree not to challenge each other’s climate plans. This includes agreements not to threaten each other’s green climate policies that create green jobs and make investments in transforming polluting industries. Our outdated trade model makes it easy for one government to target another government’s climate policies on the grounds that those climate policies made trade less fair. Climate-friendly trade deals require new rules that reward each country’s transition to a clean energy economy, including the creation of good-paying jobs and environmental protection.

Tell your representatives to prioritize climate-friendly trade

The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead on negotiating deals with countries all over the world.

Midwestern governors also want a mandate for U.S. ethanol of at least the 15 billion gallons currently in place.
The biofuels industry disagrees.
“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, U.S. president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj.
The U.S. biofuels program “supports President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices,” the agency said.","By Kim Chipman, Alicia Diaz, Erin Ailworth and Ilena Peng

After losing their biggest export market due to Donald Trump’s trade wars, U.S. farmers are now counting on the president’s support for biofuels to prevent their next crop from piling up in storage.

The administration is set to soon unveil a plan for how much crop-based biofuels will be blended into fossil fuels starting next year. A higher mandate, still opposed by some in the oil industry, would create a much needed outlet for crops after tariffs hit China — the top commodities buyer simply has no orders for corn, soybeans or wheat from the next harvest on its books, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is also president of the American Soybean Association, said of the upcoming biofuels mandate. “I can store one good crop; I can’t store multiple years.”

Trump instigated a $28 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the economic standoff with Beijing during his first term. While his administration is considering similar plans again, so far he has only pledged to find domestic markets to compensate for lost sales abroad.

Boosting demand at home is a key priority for growers, industry groups and some of the top agricultural commodity traders. That’s because overseas sales of soybeans from the next crop are currently running 79% below the average of the past five years, USDA data showed. Corn sales are 49% lower.

The U.S. farm economy was already struggling before Trump’s trade disputes. Bumper crops globally boosted supplies and sent a Bloomberg gauge of grain prices tumbling more than 40% since a 2022 peak.

For Trump and the Republican party, reinforcing the farmer vote ahead of next year’s midterm elections will be key. American growers have been a loyal constituency, but some cracks in that support have started to emerge.

An AgWeb poll of almost 3,000 farmers earlier this year revealed that 54% were against Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating strategy. A group of growers from Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi also sued the administration after the USDA canceled grants under a program to install solar panels.

The April Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer found that 56% of respondents expect tariffs to have a negative or very negative impact on farm income this year. Still, 70% said the policy will strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy in the long-term.

Domestic demand

“If we’re going to get behind this America First policy, let’s make sure that we have a great domestic policy strategy,” said Lucas Lentsch, a North Dakota farmer who heads the United Soybean Board. “Let’s make sure we’ve got good demand here at home.”

Creating more markets at home is easier said than done. The U.S. cattle herd is already at the lowest since the 1950s, curbing demand for crops in feed rations. That’s leaving farmers reliant on the so-called renewable volume obligation, or RVOs — a rule that’s been controversial since being enshrined into law two decades ago to safeguard energy security.

Farmers benefit from a higher biofuels mandate, but oil refiners have historically opposed it. Some of that has since changed as Big Oil invested in biofuels in recent years as part of their decarbonization efforts.

“We need a robust RVO to keep U.S. soybeans a profitable business to be in,” said Greg Anderson, who grows the oilseed in Nebraska.

Agribusiness giants Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Bunge Global SA and Cargill Inc., as well as trade groups including the Clean Fuels Alliance America want the Environmental Protection Agency to set the RVO at no less than 5.25 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel starting next year, up 60% from 2025 levels.

Farm lobby groups and U.S. Midwestern governors also want a mandate for U.S. ethanol of at least the 15 billion gallons currently in place.

The American Petroleum Institute is also backing the requests.

“We’re certainly doing our job to push administration to help us and help the industry,” Christopher Cuddy, ADM’s president of carbohydrate solutions, said at a BMO conference in New York this month. “The most encouraging piece for me is the fact that we’re aligned with the Petroleum Institute, which at least in my time has never happened.”

Still, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents some refiners, is against it. The group argues the U.S. isn’t selling enough gasoline to absorb so much ethanol and that there’s uncertainty over the amount of feedstock available to produce more renewable diesel and other biomass-based biofuels.

The biofuels industry disagrees. Randall Stuewe, chief executive officer of Darling Ingredients Inc., said the previous quotas set under former President Joe Biden were far too low. The company’s Diamond Green Diesel venture with Valero Energy Corp. is a top producer of renewable fuels.

That led to a number of factory closures. Biodiesel plants in the U.S. produced at just 51% of capacity in the year through April, while facilities that make renewable diesel — a fuel that’s chemically identical to its fossil fuel peer — ran at a rate of 72%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Project Tracker.

“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, U.S. president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj. “Some companies are reducing run rates or shelving their investment plans for renewable fuels,” which will make it harder to curb emissions from heavy-duty industries, he said.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.

In a statement to Bloomberg, the EPA said it has already sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House and will make it available for public comment once the proposal is signed.

The U.S. biofuels program “supports President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices,” the agency said.

A higher RVO is a chance to get domestic biofuels back up to normalized run rates of around 80%, said Brett Gibbs, a renewable energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who estimates the mandate will need to be at least 3.9 billion gallons to bring some facilities back online.

Trade uncertainty

It’s unclear how the EPA will balance the concerns of some refiners and the agriculture industry. And even as the president announced a truce with China, lowering tariffs for 90 days, uncertainty remains.

Sales of next season’s crops to Mexico and Japan, the second and third-largest soybean buyers, are lagging well behind historical levels for this time of year. And China continues to snap up supplies from rival Brazil.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has openly hinted at a bailout, and nearly two thirds of farmers in the March Purdue/CME barometer said aid was either likely or very likely. Still, many growers say they want to sell their crops instead of receiving aid.

“As a farmer, I’d rather receive it from the market,” said Philip Good, a Mississippi farmer who’s the chair of the United Soybean Board. “We go back to the domestic markets, and developing domestic uses.”

Amid rising global temperatures, surging data center demand, and bipartisan support for innovation, now is the time to double down on nuclear power. This article explores the environmental, economic, and health benefits of next-generation nuclear energy—from advanced reactor technology and the ADVANCE Act to Tennessee’s leadership and global developments. With zero carbon emissions, unmatched reliability, and growing private sector investment, nuclear energy can be the cornerstone for America’s clean, resilient, and competitive future.

A Nuclear Wake-Up Call from Washington

On May 23, 2025, the Trump administration issued a sweeping set of executive orders aimed at jumpstarting the U.S. nuclear energy industry. In a ceremony at the White House, the President announced directives for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to overhaul and streamline its approval process, aiming to license new reactors within just 18 months. Another order instructed the Departments of Energy and Defense to explore building reactors on federal lands, including military bases and data center sites.

The orders set an ambitious goal: quadruple the nation’s nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050. In doing so, the administration hopes to power an AI- and cloud-driven economy while cutting carbon emissions and bolstering U.S. energy independence.

But the proposals as you might expect are not without controversy. Some scientists and regulatory experts fear the orders could weaken safety oversight. Critics worry that consolidating power over the NRC under the White House may erode its independence. Still, the underlying signal is clear: nuclear power is back in the national spotlight—and I strongly agree that it’s time we take that seriously.

As a former US senator, physician, and Tennessean who has long championed science-based energy solutions at the federal and state level, I believe this moment presents a powerful opportunity. Done right—with safety, science, and transparency at the forefront—this could mark a turning point. The time to double down on nuclear is now.

The Case for Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy has long been at the center of energy debates since I entered the Senate in 1995, but its importance is becoming clearer than ever. As a carbon-free, high-capacity, and dependable power source, nuclear energy now provides half of America’s clean (carbon-free) electricity. Unlike wind and solar, which depend on fluctuating weather patterns, nuclear plants run at full capacity 93% of the time, far exceeding wind (33%) and solar (23%), promising a more consistent and large-scale energy supply.

The environmental benefits of nuclear power to our human health are undeniable. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, nuclear energy prevents 470 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year, equivalent to removing 100 million cars from the road. Interestingly, countries with strong nuclear programs have 19% lower carbon footprints than the global average. Irrespective of one’s view on climate change, less carbon in the air is better for your health and well-being.

Concerns over cost and nuclear waste management continue, but advancements in reactor technology are actively addressing both challenges. The ADVANCE Act (Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy), passed into law in 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support, is already streamlining reactor licensing, accelerating deployment, and cutting regulatory barriers. Meanwhile, small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors promise safer, more affordable, and faster-to-build nuclear energy solutions. The federal government’s $900 million investment in SMR technology underscores the confidence in this next-generation nuclear infrastructure.

With AI data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial expansion leading to a huge surge in U.S. energy demand, nuclear energy stands as the most scalable, carbon-free solution to meet these growing needs.

Planetary Health is Essential for Human Health

As a physician I look at planetary health through the lens of how it affects the health of individuals and their families. The changing climate with hotter days and increased weather extremes is not just an environmental issue; with advancing science we now know it is a serious public health concern as well. Record-breaking heat waves now occur annually, with over 1,200 deaths per year in the U.S. attributed to extreme heat. Asthma, heart attacks, and vector-borne diseases like Lyme and West Nile virus are all on the rise. Wildfires, fueled by higher temperatures, are blanketing communities in toxic smoke.

To more fully protect public health, we must reduce greenhouse emissions. Nuclear energy, which produces zero emissions during operation and has the potential to rapidly scale, is one of the most powerful tools we have to do so.

Favorable Public Opinion and Bipartisan Support is on the Rise

When I was in the Senate 20 years ago, public attitudes on nuclear energy were for the most part negative. That has dramatically changed. According to a 2024 survey, the percentage of Americans who “strongly” or “somewhat support” nuclear power rose from 49% to 61% between 2018 and 2022. While support dipped slightly in 2023, it rebounded to 55% in 2024, reflecting a growing recognition of nuclear power’s role in energy security and climate action.

Concerns over safety, waste disposal, and nuclear proliferation have steadily declined, though cost remains a primary public concern. However, the momentum in policy as reflected in last week’s executive orders and last year’s ADVANCE Act, investment (see below with private sector commitments), and innovation suggest that affordability challenges will be mitigated in the coming years.

In the Senate I learned that policy frequently follows public support, and that support is especially impactful if it is bipartisan. Bipartisan support for nuclear power is stronger than ever. The same 2024 survey found that 56% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans support nuclear expansion, a rare point of political agreement. This was seen in the passage of the ADVANCE Act last July, which received significant support from both parties. In the words of Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), then Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee:

“With the ADVANCE Act being signed into law, we secured a landmark win for the future of nuclear energy here in America. Getting substantive, bipartisan policy across the finish line isn’t always easy, but this is the result of years of work to build widespread consensus about the benefits of advanced nuclear reactors to our electric grid, economy, and environment.”

At the 29th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2024, more than 20 countries pledged to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, showing global confidence in nuclear energy as a critical tool for decarbonization. The return of Three Mile Island Unit 1 in Pennsylvania (Microsoft supported) and Palisades in Michigan, along with the completion of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia (the first newly built nuclear reactors in the US in over 30 years), signals that skepticism toward nuclear power is giving way to renewed optimism.

Tennessee’s Nuclear Legacy

I have followed nuclear issues in Tennessee for three decades, first in my years representing Tennessee in the Senate from 1995 until 2007, and now in my work to advance planetary health. The state’s relationship with nuclear energy runs deep. It was at Oak Ridge, during the Manhattan Project, where the modern atomic age was born. Oak Ridge National Laboratory remains a hub of innovation today, including work on advanced reactor designs, nuclear fuels, and safety technologies. And the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—created during the Great Depression to bring electricity and economic development to the region—was one of the earliest adopters of civilian nuclear power.

In fact, the first commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. to supply electricity to the grid was TVA’s Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in northern Alabama, just across the Tennessee border. Since then, TVA has become one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, running seven nuclear reactors at three sites: Watts Bar, Sequoyah, and Browns Ferry.

Today, nuclear provides nearly 40% of Tennessee’s electricity, making it the state’s largest single source of carbon-free power. It helps keep our grid reliable and our emissions lower—even as we electrify more of our economy.

On January 20, 2025, TVA announced an $800 million initiative to build small modular reactors (SMRs) statewide, with support from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. SMRs, being smaller than traditional reactors, offer enhanced safety, scalable design, and versatile deployment in remote areas or existing power grids. The first of these reactors are expected by 2033. Just this month, TVA became the first utility company in the United States to request a permit to construct a small modular reactor.

TVA is embracing public-private partnerships to address safety, affordability, and speed. Tennessee is showing the country what smart, collaborative, innovation-driven energy policy looks like.

The Data Center Boom and Tech Investment

We are on the cusp of a global energy explosion. By 2040, total electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to increase by 30%, with AI data centers alone expected to consume 8–10% of global power. According to Goldman Sachs, their energy consumption is projected to rise by 160% by 2030. These servers must run 24/7, with no downtime.

That means energy sources must be baseload—always on, unlike solar or wind. Nuclear can help fill that gap. Plants operate at over 90% capacity, more than any other energy source. They are ideal for powering industrial clusters, tech campuses, and secure defense operations.

We are seeing the tech giants making massive investments in nuclear energy:

• Microsoft is backing the recommissioning of Three Mile Island Unit 1 and Palisades.

• Google is investing in seven SMRs through Kairos Power, targeting 500 MW by 2035.

• Amazon has partnered with X-energy to develop 5 GW by 2039.

• Oracle has secured permits for three SMRs.

In addition, Major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, have also begun financing nuclear projects, a significant reversal from previous hesitations.

Global Nuclear Momentum

The U.S. helped pioneer nuclear energy—but we’re now falling behind.

China leads the world in reactor construction, building more reactors than the next six countries combined. It is developing fourth-generation reactor technology and dominates global nuclear patents. China’s ACP100 “Linglong One” small modular reactor, expected to be operational by the end of this year, is the world’s first land-based, commercial small modular reactor.

Finland is developing the world’s first deep geological repository for nuclear waste (called Onkalo), widely viewed as the most advanced and safest permanent waste solution in the world, while Sweden, France, and South Korea continue expanding their fleets.

Safety and Waste, Complicated but Manageable Challenges

Safety must remain paramount. After the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, U.S. regulators took bold steps to ensure no such incident would happen again. And they succeeded: since then, America’s nuclear fleet has operated with an exceptional safety record. Modern reactors feature passive cooling, redundant safety layers, and real-time monitoring. Nuclear has the lowest mortality rate per kilowatt-hour among major energy sources.

During my tenure in the Senate, the nuclear waste debate was front and center—dominated by Yucca Mountain and whether to proceed with construction and licensing, how to do so safely, and what to do in the meantime. We saw deep partisan divisions, but also a rare bipartisan urgency to find a long-term solution—one that, more than two decades later, remains unresolved.

Today, all of the commercial nuclear waste generated in the U.S. could fit on a single football field, stacked 30 feet high. It is currently stored safely on-site at reactor locations in dry casks, encased in steel and concrete. But as nuclear power expands, we’ll need a more robust and permanent solution.

In recent years, the Department of Energy has taken steps to reimagine its nuclear waste strategy. Its Office of Environmental Management released its Strategic Vision for 2024-2034 that emphasizes environmental and climate considerations and leans heavily on public-private partnerships. Yet this effort has not gone without scrutiny. The Government Accountability Office flagged key shortcomings, including a lack of comprehensiveness and inconsistencies with statutory requirements.

Still, there are signs of progress. We are seeing a shift toward greater transparency, shared responsibility, and collaboration between government, industry, and communities—all essential if we are to ensure public trust and long-term safety.

Innovations and Key Events Placing Progress in Perspective

As I engage on nuclear issues, I am frequently asked for some of the exciting things happening in the US. Here are some examples:

• The ADVANCE Act, passed in 2024, is streamlining licensing and accelerating deployment.

• Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 were completed in 2023 and 2024 respectively, becoming the first commercial reactors completed in the U.S. this century. Upon completion, Vogtle Unit 4 became the largest clean energy facility in the United States.

• The Natrium Project, an innovative nuclear facility proposal backed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, has received approval to replace a retired coal plant Wyoming.

• Deep Fission, a nuclear startup, is designing underground microreactors for data centers, aiming for operation by 2029.

• A $900 million federal initiative is funding SMR demonstrations to prove their economic feasibility.

• The Department of Energy is engaging in new international partnerships, such as the establishment of training centers in Poland and Ghana, which are expanding global nuclear expertise.

The Path Forward

To harness the full potential of nuclear energy, we must streamline the regulatory process and accelerate licensing for new plants and technologies. The ADVANCE Act was an important first step, but it’s just the beginning. We also need to invest boldly in research and development—supporting innovation that not only expands our energy capabilities but also improves how we manage nuclear waste.

Innovation alone isn’t enough. Public engagement and education will be key to building trust. And international collaboration, learning from global leaders and sharing best practices, will help ensure we get this right.

We live in a remarkable moment in history. Yes, there’s uncertainty. But there is also immense opportunity. The full potential of nuclear innovation has yet to be realized, and that should inspire optimism. By investing in nuclear energy and research, I believe we can secure a healthier, safer, and more economically resilient American future.

As a physician, I see the health consequences of air pollution and rising heat. As a policymaker, I see the urgency of real, science-based climate action. And as a Tennessean, I see a state that is showing the nation how to lead.

One proposal that has been receiving attention is expanding interprovincial electricity transmission.

Proponents emphasize economic efficiencies from energy trade, and the technical benefits of coupling wind and solar production with “natural batteries” in large hydro reservoirs.

Taking lessons from history, past nation-building infrastructure projects of a similar sort came up short in many ways, notably by failing to develop diversified technology systems.

To better ensure success this time, complementary, regional renewable energy and energy demand innovations must be made a priority.

Lessons from history

The transcontinental railway that linked east and west after Confederation protected Canada’s territorial integrity in reaction to American threats.

Yet, the project’s costs and the related national policy locked Canada into economic dependencies and failed to spur diversified industrial development.

Policymakers were more focused on building infrastructure than developing industrial research programs or education systems in new technologies and management techniques, as seen in Germany. Banks were more focused on financing resource extraction and large infrastructure than industrial development ventures.

Thus, Canada industrialized in a way that failed to foster domestic entrepreneurship and was dependent on American branch plants.

The pattern of big infrastructure pushes, in reaction to crises, failing to spur complementary development is recurrent in Canadian history.

Atlantic Canada’s undersea transmission link

Fast-forward more than a century and similar patterns continue to unfold.

In 2010, the provincial utilities in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador announced a plan to build an undersea transmission link connected to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the political drive to build the dam and transmission project prevented an independent assessment of alternatives, such as energy efficiency. The dam project ran significant cost overruns. Customers faced potentially large rate increases.

Today, policymakers are so focused on managing rate increases that they are neglecting new development opportunities such as allowing utilities to reduce customer bills by switching from oil to electricity for heating and transportation.

How to mandate clean heat in our buildings

Canada needs to accelerate its transition to renewable energy

The three-legged stool is the way to net zero by 2050

For a decade, Nova Scotia policymakers were over-dependent on the single megaproject to the detriment of domestic clean-energy solutions like energy efficiency and community-based renewables.

The Atlantic Loop, a proposed plan to bring hydroelectric power from Quebec to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, was eventually shelved. Only then was a greater focus placed on domestic energy demand management, storage, and renewables.

If the same policy dynamic is repeated, with cross-border megaprojects crowding out domestic clean-energy solutions for a decade, Canada will repeat its pattern of stifled technological development and fail to meet net-zero emission goals in time.

Enabling transformative technology systems

Transmission is only one component of a large technology system. To achieve a self-reliant and sustainable future it needs to be coupled with renewable energy and methods to shape demand and supply in real time.

Transition to sustainable energy introduces new technical challenges: electrifying home heating and vehicles could lead to spikes in demand during cold days or if everyone charges up their car at the same time.

Wind and solar energy generation rises and falls with the weather.

A flexible system that can ramp up and down would match renewable generation with demand and manage peaks. Transmission increases flexibility by connecting a wider diversity of energy resources across larger geographies.

Transmission needn’t work alone.

Adding solar generation can reduce the need to transmit electricity. Insulating buildings reduces electricity peaks.

In the same way, ratepayers and utilities can work together to pre-charge hot water tanks and pre-heat and pre-cool homes in advance of electricity peaks. Electric vehicles could charge when it makes the most sense for the grid.

Industrial operations can time large-scale energy demands to periods when renewables are plentiful and cheap.

Making energy demand more flexible and efficient means people and businesses that want to reduce their energy bills can even get compensated, improving both affordability and equity. In addition, homes and local communities can be protected from power outages.

(One example: Vermont is putting batteries in people’s homes instead of building transmission – the batteries balance supply and demand for the grid and can also be used by people if the power cuts out.)

Local renewable energy and demand-side flexibility resources can still face periods when they will generate more energy than they can use locally, or periods when local generators, energy efficiencies and storage can’t keep up with demand.

Concern about these demand-supply imbalances have led policymakers and utility managers to put the brakes on renewable-energy development or rely on non-renewable generators that use combustibles as back-up resources.

Interprovincial transmission and more local energy systems can complement one another. For instance, local grids could mostly balance hourly and daily ebbs and flows in demand and supply. Interprovincial transmission could manage seasonal differences by using wind and solar generation across the country to give time for hydroelectric reservoirs to fill up so they are ready for the winter heating season in a highly electrified future.

Policies should accelerate the energy transition

Policy choices will determine whether east-west-north electricity interconnections spur – or stifle – the development of multiple complementing clean technologies.

If transmission is given primacy as the favoured approach, it is more likely to crowd out other technologies and distract from solutions that are readily available. Conversely, policies that increase local renewable-energy development and electrification will show where transmission can be most effectively used to alleviate constraints that hold back local energy visions.

While building transmission takes years or decades, demand-side energy solutions can be deployed in months.

The creation of local, energy efficient “microgrids” across the country, capable of meeting their own energy needs most of the time is a national project to increase self-reliance that can start right now. Improving energy efficiency would better prepare for transmission by hedging against megaproject delays, easing peak demands that require electricity imports, and/or free up electricity for cross-border trading.

A national grid will be a successful accelerant for clean energy if it plugs into these microgrids with at-the-ready plans to use energy trade as a way to further accelerate local renewables and electrification.

If policymakers react to the current crisis by focusing solely on transmission megaprojects, they are likely to repeat a familiar Canadian pattern that will ultimately stifle technological development.

We don’t have to wait for transmission to improve energy self-reliance.

The United States is already facing a potential recession – we simply can’t afford to grind the clean energy economic engine to a halt.
Inflation Reduction Act Repeal Damage: Lost Jobs And GDP, Higher Energy Costs If the IRA is repealed by Congress, in 2030 our economy would lose nearly 790,000 jobs and $160 billion in GDP.
As fewer clean energy manufacturing facilities are built, construction activity dries up, costing jobs and cutting income across the board.
Texan homeowners will pay $8.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at more than $370 more in energy bills in 2035.","In 2022, Hyundai announced it was investing $5.5 billion to build a “Metaplant” manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries in Bryan County, Georgia. It promised more than 3,500 good-paying jobs first building the massive manufacturing facility, then making electric vehicles that cut consumer bills by providing cheaper transportation choices.

“This is the largest investment in the state of Georgia’s history, one that will diversify and expand our economy while providing strong job opportunities for Georgians today and for generations to come,” said Congressman Buddy Carter (GA-1).

When the Metaplant opened in October 2024, months ahead of schedule, it started shipping Hyundai Ioniq 5 EVs, the fourth-best selling EV in America. It also started generating millions in salaries, tax revenue, and economic activity across Southeast Georgia.

This is just one example of how the Inflation Reduction Act’s federal clean energy tax credits and government funding programs have supercharged America’s economy. Through January 2025 these policies have attracted $600 billion in new private investment across roughly 750 projects and created more than 406,000 new jobs.

But Trump administration proposals to repeal IRA federal policies to pay for tax cuts to benefit the wealthiest Americans – now being considered by Congress, which passed the IRA in 2022 – could halt this economic engine. That’s ironic considering 77% of the IRA’s clean energy and deployment investment have gone to Congressional districts represented by Republicans, and likely the reason 21 GOP Members of the House of Representatives oppose repealing them.

New Energy Innovation modeling shows that if the IRA is repealed, America’s economy and its households, will pay a staggering price. The United States is already facing a potential recession – we simply can’t afford to grind the clean energy economic engine to a halt.

Inflation Reduction Act Repeal Damage: Lost Jobs And GDP, Higher Energy Costs

If the IRA is repealed by Congress, in 2030 our economy would lose nearly 790,000 jobs and $160 billion in GDP. Between 2025 and 2035, American households would be forced to pay $32 billion in higher cumulative household energy bills. In 2035, we’d lose $190 billion from national GDP.

These economic damages would be a result of companies cancelling announced factories and expected private investment drying up as the federal government signals to corporations that America’s clean energy economy is no longer open for business. As fewer clean energy manufacturing facilities are built, construction activity dries up, costing jobs and cutting income across the board.

This economic slowdown isn’t theoretical. Hundreds of billions in private investment and state funds could be wasted on projects that may now be cancelled – more than 42,000 jobs and $57 billion in investment have already been stopped or stalled by Trump administration proposals since January 2025 alone.

And the economic slowdown isn’t surprising. Financial services company Moody’s analyzed President Trump’s campaign policy platform in June 2024 and found that it would increase inflation and weaken economic growth, threatening a recession as soon as mid-2025.

As fewer clean energy technologies like solar panels, EVs, and batteries are deployed, energy costs would rise as consumers are forced to pay volatile power prices from utilities and oil companies whose commodities are traded on a global market.

Average U.S. household electricity prices rose nearly 22% from 2018-2023, and could rise another 7% in 2025, especially if gas prices rise 91% by 2026 as predicted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

IRA repeal would throw fuel on that fire. A recent analysis for the right-leaning group ConservAmerica estimates repealing just two of the IRA’s tax credits would spike consumer electricity costs $51 billion annually by 2035. John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra, one of the country’s largest utilities warned, “if you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

America’s Biggest Losers From Inflation Reduction Act Repeal

Every state in the country would suffer economically if federal clean energy policies are repealed – they’d face higher consumer costs and job losses, along with lower GDP and less private investment. But five states would be America’s biggest losers, and they’re not liberal bastions.

Of all 48 states modeled, Texas is America’s biggest loser if federal clean energy policies are repealed, followed by California (the world’s fifth-biggest economy), Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

Texas, which has long been the country’s leader in coal and natural gas generation but also now gets the most electricity from wind and solar of any state, will suffer staggering economic losses in a repeal scenario. Texan homeowners will pay $8.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at more than $370 more in energy bills in 2035. The state will lose 115,000 jobs and GDP will fall $20.3 billion in 2035.

In California, where electricity bills have been increasing faster than inflation due to wildfire costs and volatile gas prices, families would be forced to pay $6.4 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at $180 per year in 2035. The state will lose out on 38,400 jobs and GDP will be $12.6 billion lower in 2035.

Florida, which is finally living up to its moniker as the Sunshine State by installing the second most solar energy of any state over the past five years, would pay $4.6 billion more in household energy spending from 2025-2035, peaking at $150 annually in 2035. 40,800 jobs would be stolen from workers in 2035, and GDP would drop $6.8 billion that year.

Georgia, one of the biggest beneficiaries in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing since 2022, would lose 28,600 jobs and $5.8 billion in GDP in 2035. Meanwhile, consumers would face $2.1 billion in higher energy bills from 2025-2035, peaking at $180 per year in 2035.

In Pennsylvania, considered the biggest swing state in American politics, consumers would have to pay $2.1 billion more for energy across 2025-2035. The state would lose out on 29,000 jobs and $5.6 billion in GDP, both in 2035.

Why Throw Away America’s Economic Recovery?

Americans have the right to choose the cheapest energy technologies like solar energy and EVs instead of being forced to stay hooked on expensive and outdated forms of energy.

Clean energy was a $2 trillion global market in 2024, and abandoning that market means we cede economic opportunity to countries like China while factories once again close their doors and workers lose their jobs.

The policy choices Congress makes today will reverberate across our economy for decades. Repealing policies that create jobs, fight inflation, and increase GDP isn’t how we do business in this country. Or, at least, it’s not how we should do things.",https://energycentral.com/sites/all/themes/ece2016/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-05-29 17:11:28.263691

The auto giant overtook Tesla, which has ruled Canada's EV sales charts for years.

During Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, GM sold more electric cars than Tesla in Canada.

Tesla has lost its spot as the best-selling electric car brand in Canada, making way for General Motors to come in and take the crown.

The information went relatively under the radar and was spotted by GM Authority in an Instagram post from GM Canada, which claimed the company is now the country’s best-selling EV maker.

A GM spokesperson said that the claim is “based on Canadian vehicle registrations for the third quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025,” and that “the data shows GM as the number one EV seller in Canada over that period.”

In the last quarter of 2024, GM sold roughly 15,000 EVs in Canada, while the first quarter of this year saw sales of about 6,000 EVs, according to the company’s records. In Tesla’s case, the automaker doesn’t release sales numbers for individual countries every month.

That said, data from Quebec’s vehicle registration service (SAAQ), quoted by Global News, shows a severe drop in registrations for Tesla. In Canada’s largest market for EVs, Tesla went from 5,097 cars registered in Q4 2024 to just 524 in Q1 2025, a 90% decrease. Data for the whole country is not yet available.

Both companies saw their registration numbers go down at the beginning of this year because the Canadian government stopped its iZEV rebate program for battery-powered cars in February. At the same time, Quebec halted its regional incentive program during February and March.

It’s also worth noting that General Motors managed to overtake Tesla in Canada thanks to its extensive brand portfolio. The American automaker has three brands selling EVs in Canada, while Tesla is a single entity with just four models on offer, and only two of them are high-volume vehicles. However, this hasn’t stopped it from being the favorite choice among EV buyers in Canada in the past.

Now, though, Canadians aren’t particularly keen on getting behind the wheel of a new Tesla. That has a lot to do with Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, who said that “Canada is not a real country.” Combined with the U.S. and Canada's ongoing tariff war, Canadians aren't too enthusiastic about a company controlled by the President's right-hand man. That's bad news for Tesla and, apparently, good news for GM.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/xqA0b6/s1/gm-claims-it-s-now-the-best-selling-ev-maker-in-canada.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 15:11:12.328309

An additional $1.5 billion in newly found cancelled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.
More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.
April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico.
Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized.","Businesses cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in clean energy and clean vehicle factories since January, amid rising fears over the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy, according to E2’s latest analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

In April alone, companies canceled $4.5 billion in investments in new battery, electric vehicle and wind projects in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits. An additional $1.5 billion in newly found cancelled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.

As the Senate prepares to take up the legislation, E2’s analysis shows that more than 10,000 announced jobs have already been canceled amid concerns over the advance of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far.

Through April, over 61 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy. Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states - including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.

April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized. Nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

But that same adaptation that gave them a leg up is now making them a target as the climate changes and there are fewer days with snow on the ground.

UW Madison Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology Professor Jonathan Pauli explains their change in fur color isn’t driven by cold temperatures and snow, but by the length of daylight.

“What that means then is that these snowshoe hares are still turning white, but they're turning white before the snow actually falls, so they are now mismatched with their background, and they stick out in these forests like a bright, white light bulb, and are very vulnerable then to predation,” said Pauli.

Winter-Adapted Species

As result of this climate change, snowshoe hares are moving farther and farther north.

Pauli’s research has found that about every 10 years their populations contract to the north by about five miles.

“When we begin then to project into the future with increasingly shorter and shorter snow seasons, we're predicting that the snowshoe hare distribution in the state is going to become even smaller and really just held out at the most northern reaches of our state,” he said.

Part of Pauli’s work has been focused on how snowshoe hares can survive these changes.

He and his colleagues have found that habitat is key.

If snowshoe hares have 10-acre or so stands of early aspen and alder, then they appear to have just as high of survival rates as hares whose fur color matches their background.

“You could really erode the consequence of that mismatch, i.e., erode the consequence of climate change,” said Pauli.

There’s been similar findings when it comes to ruffed grouse, another species that’s been well-adapted to snowy winters with thicker feathers and the ability to roost in the snow.

“They are species that will kind of cycle, and they'll kind of go up and down in their population numbers, but what we started seeing, especially in parts of central and southern Wisconsin, is that they're not rebounding when they sort of show these population declines,” said Benjamin Zuckerberg. “We are actually beginning to see that these declines are becoming more and more chronic, and because of that, we're seeing some of these populations beginning to sort of blink off.”

Zuckerberg is a professor at UW Madison’s Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology. He and Pauli have worked closely on winter-adapted species research.

Like the hare, Zuckerberg’s research has found that habitat can help in areas with a lack of snow.

Aspen stands and conifer cover can provide a similar buffer to the elements that burrowing under the snow does.

Zuckerberg says it then becomes a matter of working with land managers on growing the habitat to meet the needs, both now and into the future.

“This is a big part of what we do in terms of trying to incorporate what sort of future winters will look like. If we can incorporate some of those models and we say, ‘Okay, these are populations that might be more or less exposed to these changes in the future, what can we do in terms of being able to prioritize management in some of those areas?’” said Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg and Pauli’s work involved collaborating with different agencies, organizations, and various landowners.

“It's a tremendous tool for pursuing adaptation science, because it organizes all these organizations and these people associated with them around a common theme, a common infrastructure, and provides a sort of mission and purpose to those people that orients them towards the development of adaptation solutions and putting them into practice with managers across the region,” said Jessica Hellmann, she’s the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota and serves as the director of the consortium that makes up the Midwest CASC.

The CASC is made up of six universities, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Nature Conservancy, and falls under the USGS.

The research ranges from walleye fisheries to wild rice to the spread of invasive species.

In addition to projects done as a center, the CASC also awards grants to more research projects, and supports the professional development of new researchers.

“We have graduate students that we're training. We're building this future workforce,” said Hellmann.

The CASCs were created by Congress. The Midwest CASC broke off from the Northeast CASC in 2021 to focus more regionally on eight states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

The core funding for all the CASCs falls under the USGS, specifically the Ecosystem Mission Area or EMA.

Hellmann explained that the other partners, like the Universities, are typically providing in-kind funds.

“They're contributing specific dollars. They're adding graduate fellowships. So the investment from the federal government is being matched by investment from other places,” she said.

Cuts to USGS

Science Magazine reported in April that the Trump Administration planned to ask Congress to erase the EMA from the USGS budget. The Trump Administration is also planning to lay off about 1,000 employees within the EMA, but that’s been put on pause as of May 23 by a federal judge.

“That's worrisome. We think a lot about we are partly the federal government, and those of us who don't work for the federal government, we really rely on our federal partners to get our science done and to get that science implemented,” said Hellmann.

The Fiscal Year 2026 budget priorities released by the White House earlier this month doesn’t specifically list the EMA, but it does call for $564 million in cuts to USGS “programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”

Hellmann says it’s not her job to allocate money, but she knows the important value of the work they’re doing.

“We are pursuing science that doesn't exist. We haven't needed to adjust our management practices to a changing climate in the past, so we don't have a body of work to know what to be doing,” said Hellmann. “We need to be doing new science and then putting that science into practice. If that were to go away, that body of work in principle, would diminish or decline, and we would see it on the landscape in our natural and cultural resources over time.”

Both Pauli and Zuckerberg know the work the Midwest CASC does is important, with Zuckerberg saying losing it would have a crippling effect on science and the ability to translate science into action.

“I think that's a real disservice, obviously, that we are working hard, and in many cases, working with people on the ground, either agencies like the Wisconsin DNR or tribal partners, and in many cases, private landowners who are just looking to kind of gain more information about what they are seeing on their own properties and how to actually manage for it,” said Zuckerberg.

From the May/June 2025 Issue

The automotive industry is being pushed and pulled in many directions, creating a new landscape for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers as they consider their footprint strategies. There are many factors shaping this new landscape, including the accelerated but gradual shift to electrification, as well as geopolitical policy considerations, particularly the evolving trade policy in the United States. Notably, the rise in market demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has led to massive investments in EV manufacturing. According to some measures, global electric car sales were six times higher in 2023 than they were in 2018. That rise has coincided with the recent threat and implementation of tariffs over the past several months under the Trump administration, casting a degree of uncertainty for manufacturers and suppliers over how levies on fully assembled vehicles, components, and raw materials like aluminum and steel will impact production and supply chains.

Taken together, these shifts represent a new landscape to navigate for manufacturers and suppliers in the automotive industry, including those looking to expand or set up operations in the U.S. from overseas. It’s critical for automotive industry practitioners to stay up to date on the administration’s rapidly evolving stance on trade and tariffs. This may involve adjusting supply chains; pursuing more automation solutions; shifting production or assembly to the U.S., specifically in U.S. submarkets where the cost of doing business is lower; or leveraging tools to help companies minimize costs such as foreign trade zones (FTZs) and state and local business expansion incentives.

Here are some key takeaways for manufacturers and suppliers.

Navigating A Shift To Electric

Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs don’t require as many complex components, broadening the supplier base. That’s because the less complex componentry means there are a lot more companies manufacturing similar products. Suppliers to the automotive industry have to quickly adapt, innovate and develop new products to stay relevant, particularly companies that manufacture components used exclusively for internal combustion engine vehicles.

Much of the demand for EVs was initially caused by consumer demand and governmental policies, including consumer incentives. In recent years, demand and government mandates have swayed, and the market prognosis for the future of EVs remains even more uncertain. Unfortunately, given that the automotive cycle requires suppliers to invest five to eight years in advance of when their products will be sold to the consumer, it is more challenging to plan new products and, subsequently, where to build these products. For example, cars coming off the assembly line today began design and development five to eight years ago. Many companies may elect to pause decisions for new greenfield plants while they modernize existing facilities to produce internal combustion, hybrid and EV products in the same facility.

Tariffs Add Layer Of Complexity

In early March, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and increased tariffs on Chinese imports. He later imposed and then paused sweeping global tariffs. Over the past several weeks, the president has issued a number of tariff updates, including ones that directly impact the automotive industry. In early April, a 25% tax on imported vehicles went into effect. This is impacting the automotive industry by increasing costs and cutting into profit margins but also making foreign automakers reevaluate their U.S. sales strategies. For manufacturers and suppliers, companies must consider both short- and long-term impacts of the tariffs to determine if supply chains and production facilities need to be shifted, consolidated or simply left alone.

Recent tariffs on aluminum and steel products add even more complexity to the automotive industry. If elevated tariffs on steel and aluminum products persist, OEMs will be forced to source locally, which is not easily accomplished in the short term, or absorb or pass on the extra cost of tariffs to consumers. The rapidly shifting U.S. tariff landscape complicates this even more.

OEMs and suppliers must remain flexible to navigate the evolving automotive industry. This requires strategic investments in facilities, equipment and processes to adapt quickly to market shifts. To mitigate tariff impacts, companies should consider the following:

Tariff Engineering Evaluations. Use these to explore product modifications that reduce import duties. This may involve adjusting supply chains, shifting production or assembly to the U.S., or leveraging FTZs to minimize costs. If shifting production to the U.S., OEMs and suppliers should know that they can take advantage of existing expansion incentives that states and local communities provide for the automotive sector to help offset both upfront and ongoing facility operating costs.

Contract Provisions. Review contracts such as terms and conditions of sale and purchase, as well as supply agreements, to ensure there are proper force majeure clauses and pricing adjustment structures to lower the risk exposure to potential tariff increases, protecting long-term profitability.

Advocacy and Lobbying. Collaborate with trade associations and industry groups to advocate for favorable trade policies and reductions in tariffs.

Final Takeaways

The U.S. automotive industry has seen dramatic shifts in the last five years from the impact of the pandemic, the transition to EVs and now the implementation of tariffs. Any production and/or supply chain changes must have flexibility incorporated into the plans to allow companies to react quickly to rapidly changing cost, regulatory and consumer environments. Given the long-term planning necessary in the automotive industry and the competing impacts of potentially short-term tariffs, companies must exercise caution in decision-making to ensure any changes adopted can be altered if necessary. \

Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gas emissions that occur when building materials are manufactured, transported, installed, maintained, and disposed of.
While state policies have made strides toward reducing public projects’ embodied carbon emissions, the embodied carbon emissions associated with private sector buildings remain significant and largely unregulated.
“SB25-182 is a practical, market-driven approach that accelerates the transition to sustainable building materials while mitigating any increase in building costs.
“SB-182 provides critical funding for incentives to support lower-carbon building materials, aligning with ongoing efforts within the concrete industry to advance sustainability.","DENVER — A bipartisan bill to incentivize embodied carbon emissions reductions for construction materials was signed into law by Governor Jared Polis. SB25-182 Embodied Carbon Emissions—sponsored by Senators Ball and Simpson, and Representatives Brown and Weinberg—seeks to reduce the emissions released during the sourcing and manufacturing of project materials like cement and steel.

Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse gas emissions that occur when building materials are manufactured, transported, installed, maintained, and disposed of. It’s a key factor in a building’s carbon footprint and a significant driver of global warming, contributing to 11 percent of global buildings’ greenhouse gas emissions. While state policies have made strides toward reducing public projects’ embodied carbon emissions, the embodied carbon emissions associated with private sector buildings remain significant and largely unregulated.

Supporters of the legislation have the following comments:

“Colorado consistently ranks as one of the top 10 states for population growth and new commercial real estate development, which is why we must take construction-related greenhouse gas emissions seriously,” said Senator Ball, District 31, and prime sponsor of the bill. “We already lead the nation with innovative policies to cut emissions from buildings, and this legislation builds on that success by making it easier for private developers to use low-carbon materials. By expanding financing tools and incentives, we can ensure that Colorado’s dynamic construction sector drives progress towards our climate goals while creating demand for the highest quality, climate-positive materials—many of which are being developed and pioneered right here in the state.”

“As a representative of rural Colorado, I know how important it is to build a future where our towns can thrive,” said Senator Simpson, District 6 and prime cosponsor of the bill. “SB25-182 supports innovation in manufacturing which can help drive economic growth, ensuring our industries stay competitive. By leveraging existing financing tools, this bill supports job creation in Colorado’s industrial sector while aligning with smart, forward-looking economic policy.”

“Colorado has a responsibility to lead the way in tackling climate change, and that means addressing emissions in every sector—including construction,” said Representative Brown, District 12, and prime sponsor of the bill. “SB25-182 is a practical, market-driven approach that accelerates the transition to sustainable building materials while mitigating any increase in building costs. By making it easier for developers to choose low-carbon options, we can reduce emissions, support businesses, and ensure that our housing and development goals align with our state’s ambitious climate commitments.”

“This bill reflects a commonsense, market-based approach that encourages innovation without new mandates or overregulation,” said Representative Weinberg, House District 51. “By expanding access to voluntary financing tools, SB25-182 empowers private developers and manufacturers to lead in reducing emissions through American ingenuity—not government control. It’s a win for job creation, energy efficiency, and smart economic growth that keeps Colorado competitive.”

“This legislation is a valuable step to reduce embodied carbon emissions from building projects and supply chains,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “By expanding eligibility for two existing funding and financing programs—Colorado’s Industrial Tax Credit Offering (CITCO) and Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) financing program—this law creates new opportunities to advance innovative emissions reduction technologies. Addressing embodied carbon emissions in the building and industrial sectors is a key strategy in our holistic, nation-leading approach to achieve net-zero emissions in Colorado by 2050.”

“This legislation offers an opportunity to empower the private sector to invest in materials manufacturing practices and materials that prioritize the health of our communities and stability of our climate,” said Alana Miller, Colorado policy director at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “This new regulation will help Colorado meet its decarbonization goals and provide innovative leadership for other states to follow. Today, we have taken an important step when it comes to reducing the impact of our built environment.”

“The Colorado Ready Mixed Concrete Association is proud to support policies that promote responsible, forward-thinking solutions, and we look forward to collaborating with policymakers, industry partners, and stakeholders to drive meaningful progress,” said Todd Ohlheiser, executive director of the Colorado Ready Mixed Concrete Association. “SB-182 provides critical funding for incentives to support lower-carbon building materials, aligning with ongoing efforts within the concrete industry to advance sustainability. While our industry has made impressive reductions in our carbon footprint, we continue to innovate, investing in new technologies, materials, and practices that lower the carbon footprint of concrete while maintaining the durability and resilience that make it essential for construction.”

""Many industrial facilities in Colorado and across the United States are making major investments to reduce their carbon emissions. Policies like SB25-182 have the two-fold benefit of positively reinforcing this investment in emissions reductions while helping to keep our high-quality, union manufacturing jobs in the state and in the country,"" said Elena Santarella, BlueGreen Alliance state policy manager, Colorado. ""Increasing demand for lower embodied carbon products is a slam dunk policy that will benefit Colorado's industrial facilities and industrial communities.”

“SB 182 will enable property owners with projects using low carbon materials access to low-cost financing,” said Kevin Morse, managing director at Imperial Ridge Real Estate Capital, a leading national C-PACE capital provider. “This will help increase the value of their property and provide funding for climate friendly upgrades that include not just clean energy—but materials that reduce the carbon footprint of their building. By allowing embodied carbon to be included in C-PACE, Colorado would become the first state in the United States to make low-cost financing available for low carbon materials.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-29 14:10:20.305541

EVs significantly reduce air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and particulate matter in cities. Studies have shown that regions with high EV penetration see measurable improvements in local air quality, contributing to improved public health outcomes. For residents in high-traffic neighborhoods, this shift means fewer tailpipe emissions on their block, cleaner air to breathe and fewer respiratory issues tied to pollution.

Among the biggest advantages of electric vehicles is how efficiently they use energy. Gas-powered cars waste most of their fuel as heat—only about 12 percent to 30 percent actually moves the car. In contrast, EVs use over 75 percent of their energy to power the wheels. That means less waste and more mileage from the same amount of energy. Even when electricity comes from fossil fuels, EVs are still cleaner overall. On average, they deliver the emissions equivalent of 70 to 180 miles per gallon—far beyond what any gas car can match.

There are valid concerns about the carbon cost of battery manufacturing. Producing a typical EV battery emits between 2,400 and 16,000 kg of CO₂. This broad range can be attributed to numerous factors such as battery size, manufacturing location, energy sources used in production and the efficiency of supply chain and material extraction processes. On the flip side, the average gas-powered car emits roughly 43,500 kg of CO₂ over a standard 150,000-mile lifespan, a massive multiplier. Even in the worst-case scenario—battery production combined with coal-generated electricity—EVs still generate less lifetime carbon than ICE vehicles. In regions using cleaner energy mixes like solar or hydro, EV emissions can drop to less than half that of their gasoline counterparts.

Ownership costs also favor EVs. A 2024 Atlas Public Policy study found that EVs can save owners between $7,000 and $11,000 across the lifetime of the vehicle due to reduced fuel and maintenance costs. With fewer moving parts and regenerative braking systems, EVs have lower service requirements compared to ICE vehicles. While insurance premiums can be higher, the total cost of ownership is increasingly favorable, especially as battery prices fall and competition among automakers increases.

Range anxiety remains a barrier to adoption, but charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly. Public and private investment is increasing the number of fast-charging stations across the U.S., as more than 200,000 public charging ports are now available across the country, according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. In cities, the growth of on-street and garage charging stations is making EV ownership more practical for apartment dwellers and those without private driveways. Still, rural communities face slower rollout, and their EV adoption lags behind urban areas by 40 percent in the U.S. as a result. However, these areas often have the advantage of higher homeownership rates and detached housing, making it easier to install home chargers.

Policy also plays a critical role in accelerating adoption. Governments worldwide are introducing mandates to phase out gas cars, alongside incentives like tax credits, rebates and infrastructure grants. The EU plans to phase out new ICE vehicle sales by 2035, and China’s New Energy Vehicle policy aims to have EVs comprise 40 percent of all car sales by 2030, setting the pace for global EV adoption. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act provides up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for eligible EVs, while states and cities add further benefits. At the city level, these policies can directly translate into cleaner bus routes, low-emission zones and incentives for residents to make the switch—shaping healthier, quieter neighborhoods in the process. Major hubs like New York and Los Angeles are electrifying bus fleets, enforcing low-emission zones and providing grants to small businesses that switch to electric delivery vans.

While battery supply chains, recycling and infrastructure equity remain ongoing challenges, the cumulative data support EVs as a cornerstone of sustainable urban transportation. The shift toward electric mobility is not only reshaping the automotive industry—it is redefining how cities combat pollution, adapt to climate change and build long-term resilience.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/resource-database-zX_vbw4Z_IY-unsplash.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-05-29 14:09:44.996650

In a unanimous ruling, the supreme court justices overturned a lower court’s decision that had halted the fossil fuel project on the grounds that an environmental impact assessment by a federal agency had been too limited in scope.

Thursday’s ruling upends five decades of legal precedent by limiting the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) – the country’s landmark environmental legislation passed by Congress and signed by Richard Nixon in 1970.

“This ruling hands fossil fuel developers a hall pass to continue to destroy our climate. The supreme court’s decision endangers local communities, many of them Indigenous and rural, in favor of the dirty energy status quo. It weakens communities’ ability to stop harmful developments, ignores the cumulative harm of polluting projects, and gives federal agencies even more power to rubber-stamp infrastructure that threatens our water, air and climate,” said Ashfaq Khalfan, Oxfam America’s director of climate justice.

“After the hottest year on record, when the US should be improving environmental safeguards and empowering frontline communities, this decision is a giant step backwards.”

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-km) expansion in north-eastern Utah that would connect oil and gas producers to the broader rail network and allow them to access larger markets.

The proposed railway would transport up to 350,000 barrels of waxy crude oil a day from the sparsely populated Uinta Basin through the Colorado Rockies to refineries on the Gulf coast. If completed, the railway would more than quadruple oil production in the Uinta Basin, by linking the oilfields to national rail networks and a handful of refineries in Texas and Louisiana.

The project is backed by coalition of seven Utah counties and an infrastructure investment group, but Thursday’s ruling will be seen as a major victory for the fossil fuel industry more broadly, which has for decades lobbied against Nepa.

“Our bedrock environmental laws, like Nepa, are meant to ensure people are protected from corporate polluters. Regrettably, the supreme court has scored one for the oil companies who don’t want you to look too closely at the harm their product will do to Black and brown communities in Cancer Alley … Today’s decision will undoubtedly help the fossil fuel industry,” said Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff.

The case tested the scope of environmental impact studies that federal agencies must conduct under a US law called the National Environmental Policy Act, enacted in 1970 to prevent environmental harms that might result from major projects. The law mandates that agencies examine the “reasonably foreseeable” effects of a project.

The supreme court heard arguments on 10 December in the case, which has been closely watched by companies and environmental groups for how the ruling might affect a wider range of infrastructure and energy projects.

Environmental reviews that are too broad in scope can add years to the regulatory timeline, risking a project’s viability and future infrastructure development, according to companies and business trade groups.

The Surface Transportation Board, which has regulatory authority over new railroad lines, issued an environmental impact statement and approved the railway proposal in 2021.

The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups sued over approval, as did Colorado’s Eagle county, which noted that the project would increase train traffic in its region and double traffic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit ruled in favor of the challengers in 2023, concluding that the environmental review inadequately analyzed the effects of increased oil production in the basin as well as downstream, where the oil would be refined.

Democratic former president Joe Biden’s administration had backed the railway coalition in the case, as did the state of Utah.

Fifteen other states supported the challengers. Colorado said its economy relies on outdoor recreation, and that the project raises the risk of leaks, spills or rail car accidents near the Colorado River’s headwaters.

The group, led by the SOC Investment Group and representing about 7.9 million shares, sent a letter Wednesday to board chair Robyn Denholm requesting immediate action. While their stake is a small fraction of Tesla’s 3.22 billion outstanding shares, the request signals growing frustration among investors as the company confronts weakening demand and increased scrutiny.

Tesla reported a 71% drop in quarterly profits and a 13% year-over-year decline in vehicle sales during its most recent earnings call. Shareholders argue Musk’s divided attention — including involvement with federal government projects and other personal ventures — has contributed to Tesla’s recent struggles and reputational damage.

The letter also urges the board to implement a formal CEO succession plan, limit directors’ outside business commitments and add at least one truly independent board member with no ties to existing members. Tesla’s board has faced past criticism for its close relationship with Musk, including from a Delaware judge who in late 2024 struck down the CEO’s $56 billion compensation package, citing weak oversight and board conflicts of interest.

Tesla stock has dropped about 24% since its December 2024 high, though it has recently rebounded following reports that Musk plans to shift his focus back to Tesla and away from Washington politics.

Meanwhile, the company continues to face operational challenges. A redesigned Model Y has failed to boost sales, and the long-promised Full Self-Driving technology remains in limited pilot testing. Tesla plans to launch a small-scale robotaxi program in Austin on June 12, but industry analysts remain skeptical about its near-term impact.

External risks are also mounting, including potential repeals of electric vehicle tax credits and new tariffs on imported parts. Investors warn that without stronger leadership and focus, Tesla may struggle to maintain its position in the increasingly competitive EV market.

Congress overturned an EPA waiver granted to California to allow that industry-dominating state to ban fossil fuel vehicle sales by 2035, a move that Colorado officials say also negates copycat EV mandates passed by Colorado and a dozen-odd other states.

In 2023, Colorado air regulators voted to require 82% of new vehicles be EVs by 2032, and an increasing share of heavy trucks as well, going well beyond floors set by the EPA. They also required a study of how Colorado could match California’s fossil fuel car ban by 2035.

The 8-0 ruling overturned a lower court's decision that had halted the project and had faulted an environmental impact statement issued by a federal agency called the Surface Transportation Board in approving the railway as too limited in scope. The project was challenged by environmentalists and a Colorado county.

The ruling, authored by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was joined by four other conservative justices. The court's three liberal justices filed a separate opinion concurring in the outcome.

A coalition of seven Utah counties and an infrastructure investment group are seeking to construct an 88-mile railway line in northeastern Utah to connect the sparsely populated Uinta Basin region to an existing freight rail network that would be used primarily to transport waxy crude oil.

Utah Republicans celebrated the decision, with Sen. John Curtis calling it ""welcome news for Utah and America's energy future"" and Gov. Spencer Cox saying the justices ""unanimously stopped an insane idea that doesn't exist anywhere in the law.""

""For too long, litigious groups have weaponized environmental reviews to stall critical projects — oil, gas, wind, solar, nuclear and more,"" Curtis posted.

""The Uinta Basin Railway will power our economy by connecting rural Utah to more markets, supporting job creation and energy production,"" state Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a statement to KSL.com. ""Utah already leads the nation with low energy prices, and this project helps secure our state's position as a global energy leader, delivering reliable, safe and affordable power for generations to come.""

For too long, litigious groups have weaponized environmental reviews to stall critical projects — oil, gas, wind, solar, nuclear and more.

–Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah

Rep. Mike Kennedy added that the law in question has been used to block growth in rural communities, saying the court decision ""has empowered local and state governments to pursue development opportunities that directly benefit Utah residents.""

The case tested the scope of environmental impact studies that federal agencies must conduct under a law called the National Environmental Policy Act, enacted in 1970 to prevent environmental harms that might result from major projects. The law mandates that agencies examine the ""reasonably foreseeable"" effects of a project.

Kavanaugh wrote that agencies need only consider environmental effects of a project at hand and not the ""effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects,"" and that courts must offer agencies ""substantial deference"" regarding the scope of these assessments.

""NEPA is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock. The goal of the law is to inform agency decisionmaking, not to paralyze it,"" Kavanaugh wrote.

It can even play the same role as the Equinox does for Chevy—assuming it’s priced competitively. And on the luxury side, the refreshed Lexus RZ could serve a similar role to Cadillac’s Lyriq—a stylish, premium EV getting more upmarket buyers into EVs.

Notably, two of the seven EVs will be built in the U.S., likely with locally produced batteries from Toyota’s North Carolina plant. The first is expected to be that three-row SUV; the second is a mystery, for now.

But by 2027, when you walk into a Toyota or Lexus dealership, you’ll find a fully electric option in every major segment. That’s part of Toyota’s so-called “multi-pathway approach”: offering gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and EV options so customers can pick the powertrain that they think works best for them.

Building two mass-market EVs in the U.S. is a bold bet, especially in today’s political and regulatory climate. The Trump camp wants to roll back EV tax credits and weaken emissions targets, casting a shadow over the already tough economics of EV manufacturing. Outside of Tesla, no automaker has turned a profit on EVs in the U.S., and this remains one of the most capital-intensive bets in the industry.

Still, Toyota is pushing ahead. That likely means the company sees real growth on the horizon. Toyota typically doesn’t commit a new model to production unless it expects to sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year. But in this case, if its EV sales fall short, it’ll export the vehicles to markets where demand is strong.

“In the future, we think it’s a really important segment that we don’t want to give up to the competition,” Cooper Ericksen, Toyota’s senior vice president of planning and strategy, told Bloomberg.

Competition is indeed growing and Toyota doesn’t want to be left behind. Tesla still commands nearly half the U.S. EV market and has cheaper models coming soon. General Motors, Hyundai, and Kia are all expanding their EV lineups, especially in the crossover and large family SUV segments Americans love. Toyota doesn’t seem keen to let them run away with it.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/3WY0ER/s1/toyota-ev-america.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:10:24.589891

Now, the company’s energy business — a rare bright spot amid faltering demand for its EVs — is under assault.

House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate.

If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla’s energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year.

With CEO Elon Musk claiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energy appealed to Senate Republicans.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.”

Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage.

Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said.

The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk.

Last year, 93% of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months.

Like many residential solar installers, Tesla’s energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, SunRun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1296608191.jpeg?resize=1200,801",N,,2025-05-29 13:18:45.278035

Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans’ attitudes toward and experiences with extreme weather. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,085 U.S. adults from April 28 to May 4, 2025.

Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.

Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.

As weather and climate disasters costing over $1 billion in damages become regular occurrences in the United States, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that 77% of Americans say stricter building standards are a good idea for communities at high risk of extreme weather. These findings come amid conversations about scaling back the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in setting standards and working with states to handle disaster response.

The survey also finds that 64% of Americans think it is a good idea for government to provide financial assistance for people in high-risk communities to rebuild in the wake of extreme weather events, illustrating the multiple considerations Americans bring to conversations about how the country should deal with the growing impacts of extreme weather.

The survey conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025, among 5,085 U.S. adults explores attitudes about the steps government could take to address extreme weather impacts, as well as the link Americans see between extreme weather and climate change. The report builds on long-standing efforts at the Center to understand how Americans think about the interrelated issues of energy, climate and extreme weather.

Key highlights:

Americans have mixed views on government helping homeowners cover the rising cost of insurance: 41% say this is a good idea, while 34% call it a bad idea.

Americans express some openness to banning new construction in areas at high risk of extreme weather (39% say good idea vs. 28% say bad idea). But few support requiring people to move out of high-risk areas (only 14% say this is a good idea). On this and other policy steps, many Americans say they are not sure, underscoring the developing nature of public views on this issue.

Most Americans who have experienced extreme weather in the last year say climate change played a role. Across each of the five types of extreme weather events we asked about (like intense storms or floods), at least eight-in-ten who experienced the event say climate change contributed a lot or a little.

Partisanship shapes perceptions of extreme weather itself, as well as the connection to climate change. Republicans are less likely to report extreme weather events than Democrats. And while most Republicans who do report experiencing extreme weather events draw a link to climate change, they are much less likely than Democrats to see a strong connection.

Views among Republicans and Democrats on extreme weather policies

On actions government could take around extreme weather, there are notable areas of common ground between Republicans and Democrats.

Amid recent debates over the impacts of stricter building codes, large shares of both Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (84%) as well as Republicans and Republican leaners (71%) say it is a good idea for government to set stricter building standards for new construction in communities at high risk of extreme weather.

Similarly, majorities of both groups also think it’s a good idea for government to provide financial assistance for people in high-risk areas to rebuild after extreme weather impacts.

Differences emerge on other potential steps. On balance, more Republicans say it is a bad idea than a good idea for government to help people with the rising cost of homeowners insurance (44% vs. 32%). By contrast, larger shares of Democrats view this as a good idea than a bad one (50% vs. 24%). Among both groups, about a quarter say they are not sure. Debates about how to handle rising premiums are taking place around the country, including in California in the wake of devastating wildfires.

When it comes to the idea of government banning new construction in high-risk areas, Republicans are split: 34% say this is a good idea, while 38% say it is a bad idea. Democrats are more open to this approach (44% say good idea vs. 19% say bad idea).

Both Republicans and Democrats express far more negative than positive sentiment when it comes to the idea of government requiring people to move out of areas at high risk of extreme weather.

Views on these six potential government actions among the general public – and partisan groups – are largely similar to those measured in a 2024 Center survey. Still, support for government providing financial assistance for people to rebuild has increased 10 percentage points among Republicans and 5 points among Democrats since last year.

Extreme weather and its link to climate change

Climate scientists have found that climate change is driving an increase in extreme weather, as documented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.

Overall, 74% of Americans say they’ve experienced at least one of five forms of extreme weather in the past 12 months. Among those reporting any of these experiences, majorities view climate change as a contributor to the extreme weather.

For instance, among the roughly half of Americans who say they have experienced long periods of unusually hot weather in the last year, 91% say climate change contributed either a lot (64%) or a little (27%) to this.

Large majorities who have experienced other forms of extreme weather, including major wildfires and floods and intense storms, also say climate change contributed a lot or a little to these events.

Go to the Appendix for more details about experiences of extreme weather events across U.S. geographic regions.

Partisan differences in reporting extreme weather

Partisanship is a factor that shapes both Americans’ reporting of extreme weather events and the connection they see to climate change.

Republicans are less likely than Democrats to report experiencing extreme weather – a difference that holds even when taking into account where people live.

For instance, 60% of Democrats say they experienced long periods of unusually hot weather in the last year, compared with 37% of Republicans. Gaps for other, more specific events – like major wildfires – tend to be more modest; but the pattern holds across all five forms of extreme weather included in the survey.

Put another way, even when comparing views among Republicans and Democrats in the same geographic region, Democrats perceive more unusual or extreme weather events.

How Republicans and Democrats view the link between extreme weather and climate change

Overwhelming shares of Democrats who have experienced extreme weather in the last year say climate change played a role, including majorities who say climate change contributed a lot.

For instance, 98% of Democrats who report experiencing droughts or water shortages in the last year say climate change contributed either a lot (74%) or a little (24%).

On balance, Republicans who report extreme weather also see a link to climate change, but to a lesser extent than Democrats.

When it comes to droughts or water shortages, about three-quarters of Republicans who say they’ve experienced these events recently believe climate change contributed either a lot (30%) or a little (44%).

Similar patterns are seen between partisan groups on the four other forms of extreme weather included in the survey.",https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/PS_25.05.29_extreme-weather_featured.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-05-29 13:22:09.304679

This according to a new statewide poll from Public Opinion Strategies released Thursday, which found that three-quarters of respondents worry about access to affordable electricity in Pennsylvania and nationwide.

Another 78% said their household energy bills have risen over the last two years as part of an inflationary trend that some attribute to uncertain state and federal government regulations.

The pattern holds steady as power companies in central and western Pennsylvania prepare to raise rates next month. On the horizon, a pending court decision could saddle ratepayers with a regional carbon tax.

Or, state lawmakers could throw support behind Gov. Josh Shapiro’s package of Pennsylvania-centric programs meant to lower emissions, expand the use of solar and wind energy, and increase investment from energy companies.

Polling indicates that most residents prioritize affordable electricity and power grid stability and want lawmakers on either side of the aisle to figure out how best to do it. In the meantime, 69% of respondents will conserve energy by turning off lights, appliances and electronics while not in use, while only 7% will install solar panels and 10% will buy an electric vehicle.

The Commonwealth Foundation, a policy group focused on fiscal conservancy in state government, said the latter shows that prioritizing climate policy over energy affordability is a mistake.

“Amid skyrocketing electricity rates and the prospect of climate policies that will further exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis, voters are demanding access to more affordable energy,” said Erik Telford, the foundation’s senior vice president of public affairs.

The poll, commissioned by the foundation, compiled responses from 800 registered voters between May 16-21. Roughly two-thirds said they were unaware of the incoming rate hikes for PPL and Duquesne Light of 16% and 15%, respectively.

For the Shapiro administration, however, legislative support for his PACER and PRESS programs – which are part of the governor’s broader climate and energy goals in the Lightning Plan – would lower prices over the next 15 years, saving customers $644 million and attracting $11.4 billion in “reliable energy investments.”

“We have to meet this moment and this plan builds on the work my administration did last year to bring together leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates to develop a plan for the future,” Shapiro said earlier this year in Pittsburgh.

The foundation said Shapiro’s plans would have the opposite effect: rates would climb 60% over the next decade, doubling household electricity bills. Meanwhile, a tripling of the amount of power derived from renewable resources – which are considered less reliable than fossil fuel and nuclear plants – would destabilize the power grid, not balkanize it.

Even PJM, the power grid operator for 13 mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C., and the organizations with which it collaborates, said the system is at a crossroads.

“Make no mistake: transitioning the energy mix isn’t a simple task,” said Diane Holder, vice president of engineering and strategic engagement at Reliability First, a regional entity of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, during a state House committee hearing earlier this month. “It’s not a shift from one resource to another. It’s a monumental change to how the bulk power system operates and it will take careful planning – and we risk blackouts if we don’t get this right.”

Holder highlighted data revealed in NERC’s Long Term Reliability Assessment, released in December. The report evaluates resource adequacy across North America.

It states that generation is retiring faster than new resources are coming online and rising electricity demand is further compounding the challenge.

Calling it “very concerning,” she noted it shows more than half of the continent is at high or elevated risk of resource adequacy shortfalls over the next ten years.

While the PJM region isn’t considered “high” risk, it is currently rated as “elevated.” Notably, last year’s assessment was “normal,” so things have worsened, she said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/4f/24f65daa-0031-11f0-b87c-6be70e3db04e/67d31760c3f43.image.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 14:11:08.412638

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” Tesla Energy, the company’s solar and battery division, wrote on X.

The House-passed reconciliation package would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s residential solar credit at the end of the year and rapidly phase down the clean electricity investment credit for all forms of generation except nuclear, disqualifying all but a few shovel-ready projects.

The bill would also terminate most credits for electric vehicles at the end of the year, disqualifying Teslas from a $7,500 incentive at a time when the company is experiencing declining sales and backlash linked to Musk’s actions to gut the federal workforce.

Tesla’s energy division has seen faster growth and higher profits than its vehicle business in recent years. Launched by Musk in 2015, it sells a range of solar and battery energy storage products to homeowners and utility companies.

Tesla Energy urged the Senate to support a “sensible wind down” of the residential solar and the clean electricity investment credits, which it said would allow “continued speedy deployment of over 60 [gigawatts] capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.”

Musk later amplified the message on his personal X account, along with a post from another user that said “slashing solar energy credits is unjust.”

“There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar,” Musk wrote.

Musk said last month that he would step back from his government role to devote more time to running Tesla, and he confirmed Wednesday that his tenure as a “special government employee” was coming to an end.

Backing the credits is a shift in position for Musk, who has previously supported ending all government subsidies, including those for EVs and the fossil fuel industry. He has contended that ending the EV credit would help Tesla because its competitors are more reliant on it.

The oil lobby has long disputed referring to its tax breaks as “subsidies,” arguing they are in line with deductions claimed by all corporate taxpayers.

The accident spurred increased focus on alternative energy sources like gas, coal, and renewables, as well as a push for new reactor designs with improved safety features.

The event also took its toll on the uranium market and companies that explore for and mine the nuclear fuel. Post-Fukushima, the slump in demand cratered uranium prices, with the market bottoming out near $30 a pound in mid-2014.

Fast-forward to 2022, and the story changes. Spurred by renewed demand for nuclear energy and a leap in yellowcake prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, uranium miners began reviving mothballed uranium projects.

Uranium hit a 10-year high of $105.49/lb on Jan. 29, 2024, and closed out last year with a spot price of $72.63 and a long-term price of $80.50, according to Canadian uranium miner Cameco.

Uranium futures rose to $72 per pound in late May, the highest in nearly three months, and extending the rebound from 18-month lows in March as the possibility of political support for the nuclear sector outweighed the view of ample supply, said Trading Economics.

Despite skepticism from some quarters on the safety of nuclear, there are just as many who believe it is a relatively benign form of baseload power that is necessary for the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Nuclear, the argument goes, is emissions-free but does not suffer the intermittency problem of wind and solar.

One of the more recent cheerleaders of nuclear is Donald Trump.

Last Friday the US president signed executive orders pledging to expand American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 gigawatts in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050.

""Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,"" World Nuclear News quoted from the executive order ‘Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base’.

A Fox News article posted on the White House website states:

Through a series of executive orders signed this week, President Trump is taking action to usher in an American nuclear renaissance. For the first time in many years, America has a path forward for quickly and safely testing advanced nuclear reactor designs, constructing new nuclear reactors at scale, and building a strong domestic nuclear industrial base…

This week’s executive actions will help us reach that goal in four ways.

First, we are going to fully leverage our DOE national laboratories to increase the speed with which we test new nuclear reactor designs. There is a big difference between a paper reactor and a practical reactor. The only way to bridge that gap—understanding the challenges that must be surmounted to bring reactors to the market, and building public trust in their deployment—is to test and evaluate demonstration reactors.

Second, for our national and economic security, we are going to leverage the Departments of Defense and Energy to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land. This will support critical national security needs which require reliable, high-density power sources that are invulnerable to external threats or grid failures.

Third, to lower regulatory burdens and shorten licensing timelines, we are asking the NRC to undergo broad cultural change and regulatory reform, requiring a decision on a reactor license to be issued within 18 months. This will reduce regulatory uncertainty while maintaining nuclear safety. We will also reconsider the use of radiation limits that are not science based, impossible to achieve, and do not increase the safety of the American people.

There are currently 54 nuclear power plants operating in the United States, with 28 states having at least one reactor. According to the Energy Information Agency (EIA), Unit 3 at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia entered serviced on July 31, 2023 as part of a two-unit expansion project. It has 1,117 megawatts (MW) of net summer electricity generation capacity.

Unit 4, a Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized light water reactor, began commercial operations in April 2024. It is now the largest nuclear power plant in the United States, with four reactors and a total of 4,536 MW net summer electricity generation capacity.

Meanwhile ,in Europe, the birthplace of the anti-nuclear movement, there has also been a rethink of nuclear power as countries pursue more energy independence.

As CNBC reports, In just the last few weeks, Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power as part of a major policy shift, Spain reportedly signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power.

Denmark banned the use of atomic energy in 1985. It is important to point out that the Danish government is not considering a return to traditional nuclear power plants. Rather, The renewables-heavy Scandinavian country said in mid-May that it plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

Spain’s Environmental Transition Minister said in late April that, while the government is proceeding with plans to retire nuclear reactors over the next decade, extensions beyond 2035 could not be ruled out.

The statement by Minister Sara Aagesen followed a catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal and southern France.

Germany, which closed the last of its three remaining nuclear plants in 2023, recently dropped its objection to French efforts to ensure that nuclear power is treated on a par with renewables in EU legislation, the Financial Times reported on May 19, citing French and German officials.

“The clean energy transition is happening,” said Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., a champion of the clean energy provisions.
Still, the IRA’s tax credits have helped ramp up corporate investment in clean energy in Minnesota.
According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.
Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.","WASHINGTON — Gov. Tim Walz vigorously leveraged federal “green” tax credits — for electric cars, solar panels and other clean energy technologies and projects — that are now on the chopping block as Congress moves forward on President Donald Trump’s game-changing budget.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would cut social programs, extend Trump’s first-term tax breaks and raise the nation’s debt ceiling, would phase out former President Joe Biden’s ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gases — and hopefully make energy more affordable — by providing tax incentives to individuals and industry.

The proposal, approved by the U.S. House earlier this year, will likely be revised by the U.S. Senate. But when it comes to corporate efforts to invest in clean technologies, the bill has already had a chilling effect.

Canadian company Heliene, a maker of panels and other components of solar energy systems, said it’s holding off on its decision to build a new plant in Minnesota until the fate of the tax credits is clear.

Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk told MinnPost that a main concern is a power generation tax credit that benefits company clients that use the sun to generate electricity.

As it stands, the massive budget bill in the House is what Bloomberg called a “nightmare scenario for U.S. clean energy advocates.”

Under the legislation, wind, solar, geothermal and other emission-neutral projects would need to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s final passage — or start operations within two years — to receive the credits before they expire, mostly in 2028.

Currently, those credits could lower the cost of a project by 30% and were available for zero-emission projects until the early 2030s.

However, Harry Godfrey, managing director at Advanced Energy United, a clean energy business association, said a “poison pill’ was inserted into the program in the form of the new 60-day deadline.

“The bill was problematic to begin with,” Godfrey said. “But this was a meat cleaver.”

In addition, under the bill, any clean energy company that uses Chinese imports to build a facility or generate energy would be barred from receiving federal money. And the $7,500 tax break available to buyers of certain electric vehicles would be eliminated by the end of next year.

To add insult to injury, the legislation would also impose a $250 annual fee on owners of electric vehicles to compensate for lost revenue from gasoline taxes.

The bill would also phase out tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements and residential clean energy installations like solar panels.

“The clean energy transition is happening,” said Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., a champion of the clean energy provisions. “The only question is if America will lead or follow, and I think we should lead.”

She called “recklessly” ending the incentives businesses are counting on to build “cheaper, cleaner energy” would force the United States to fall behind the rest of the world.

“We’re already seeing that these proposed changes are bad for business here in Minnesota,” Smith said. “Heliene paused construction of their solar manufacturing facility because of the cuts Republicans are pushing, and countless other projects are in limbo.”

‘Green New Scam’

Some of the clean energy tax breaks have existed for years and were implemented during the Carter, Bush and Obama administrations. But Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act expanded and extended them and added a few new ones to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

That effort was championed by Walz, who signed a law requiring utilities to provide 100% percent clean electricity in the state by 2040.

But Trump has waged war on the Inflation Reduction Act, calling it a “Green New Scam” and a waste of money and vowed to overturn most of its provision.

Still, the IRA’s tax credits have helped ramp up corporate investment in clean energy in Minnesota.

For instance, they helped Xcel Energy build a huge solar project near its Sherco coal plant site in Becker.

“Energy production tax credits provide numerous benefits to our customers and communities,” said Xcel Energy spokesman Kevin Coss. “We pass 100% of the savings to customers in the form of lower electricity rates, helping keep bills low.”

Coss also said Xcel uses the federal tax credits on projects that create jobs, raise local tax revenue and drive economic development, an argument echoed by clean energy advocates.

Another project attracted to the state by the promise of federal money is a “green” hydrogen production plant in Fridley. Green hydrogen is generated through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.

According to clean energy advocate Evergreen Action, Minnesota has gained more than $1 billion in new clean energy investments and nearly 1,800 new jobs since the IRA was approved in August of 2022.

“The governor has made Minnesota a leader in clean technology and renewable energy by supporting electric vehicles and putting the state on a path toward 100% clean energy by 2040,” said Claire Lancaster, the governor’s spokeswoman. “But Minnesota stands to lose billions in federal funding that lowers energy costs by helping Minnesotans move toward more energy-efficient homes, cars, and electricity.

Lancaster also said that besides eliminating thousands of jobs, the legislation would leave Minnesotans more vulnerable to pollution, extreme weather events and the health and safety risks that they bring.

‘On track to raise energy bills’

The Senate is expected to make changes in the House-passed bill and clean energy boosters and the clean technology and energy industries are turning their full attention on the chamber.

Coss, of Xcel Energy, said “we are working closely with our industry partners, trade associations, and other stakeholders to ensure federal policymakers are made aware of the important benefits of these tax policies for their constituents.”

Green tax credit supporters say the end to innovation in the green energy industry will result in increased energy costs for homeowners, small businesses and industry, a 10% increase over the next few years as demand for energy grows.

“We’re on track to raise people’s energy bills,” said Evergreen Energy spokesman Seth Nelson.

Lobbying to save the tax credits has focused on four GOP senators who have sizable clean energy investments in their states because getting the bill through the Senate won’t be easy.

“I do think there are some persuadable senators,” Nelson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cannot lose more than three GOP votes because no Democrat is expected to support it.

And four Republican senators have expressed concerns over the elimination of the credits.

Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas sent Thune a letter last month warning against the obliteration of the IRA — and especially the green tax credits.

“Our country is blessed with abundant natural resources and an entrepreneurial spirit that uniquely positions us to power both our economy and the world — enabling U.S. leadership in innovation, energy production, and manufacturing alike,” the senators wrote. “Many of the investments that make this possible are enabled by current tax provisions, including some from the Inflation Reduction Act.”

At a press conference at a clean energy company in Utah this week, Curtis said he would “make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future.”

Other GOP senators are being targeted too. Several analyses show that much of the tax credits are going to states where majorities voted for Trump.

“This will hit hardest in states that Trump won,” Nelson said.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DodgeCenterWindTurbines940.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 13:18:52.483360

Community & Worker Economic Transition Office launches MI Hub for Manufacturing with support from philanthropy

Michigan is a top 10 state for clean energy jobs, leads the nation for total jobs in advanced materials and has the fastest-growing workforce for energy-efficient HVAC and renewable heating and cooling

The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Community & Worker Economic Transition Office announced a public-private partnership designed to create and retain good-paying jobs, support Michigan manufacturers and strengthen the state’s position as a global leader in the energy supply chain at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy have committed a combined $3.5 billion annually — $2 billion from DTE and $1.5 billion from Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses. This historic commitment is focused on strengthening local supply chains for critical energy infrastructure, such as transformers, and next-generation technologies, including solar components and long-duration energy storage systems.

“Michigan is paving the way growing our economy and meeting our ambitious energy goals,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Today, we’re launching new resources designed to support our manufacturers and help them create and retain good-paying jobs while building strong, resilient energy supply chains right here in Michigan. This partnership will position our manufacturers to lead in the clean energy future, keeping production local and ensure that Michigan remains a hub of innovation and industry. Let’s keep working hard to make a difference and build a Michigan where everyone can thrive.”

“We know we can keep Michigan as a leader in manufacturing, while also strengthening the prosperity of everyone in our state,” said Community & Worker Economic Transition Office Director Jonathan Smith. “Through innovative partnerships like this one between government, industry, nonprofit organizations and philanthropy we can deliver powerful lasting, impactful solutions that help our businesses, workers and communities plan for and thrive in the future.”

The State of Michigan will work closely with DTE and Consumers Energy to identify in-state suppliers, help them retool to meet the energy sector’s needs and connect them with the resources necessary to grow and compete. The partnership will reduce long lead times for critical equipment and components that currently have few or zero domestic suppliers. Having more local suppliers also means keeping prices affordable for Michigan ratepayers.

“DTE has a long history of partnering with Michigan businesses to keep our spending local, and we’re proud to build on that history by committing to spend $2 billion annually with Michigan suppliers,” said Trevor Lauer, vice chairman and group president, DTE Energy. “Focusing on keeping our spending in-state has a transformative impact on the Michigan economy, allowing businesses to grow and creating thousands of jobs, while also helping DTE to build an agile supply chain that allows us to deliver the services our customers demand and deserve.”

The partnership will also help utilities more quickly and efficiently meet their reliability and resiliency goals, putting Michigan on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

“We’d love to see Michigan’s manufacturing talent and expertise build the energy equipment we need right here at home,” said Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CMS Energy and Consumers Energy. “Cultivating and buying from a resilient, robust energy supply chain in Michigan continues Consumers Energy’s longstanding commitment to in-state suppliers. It’s the natural next step, and the right thing for Consumers Energy, our customers and the state.”

To help manufacturers and clean energy startups retool their facilities and retain their workers to support new work coming in from utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy, the Transition Office is also launching the MI Hub for Manufacturers. With $1.5 million in support from philanthropy and a partnership with Next Street, a national small business and supplier solutions company, this dynamic, interactive online platform will connect small and mid-sized manufactures to public, private and non-profit resources. The platform will publish funding opportunities, connect businesses to expert advisors and capital products, provide on-demand digital learning tools and host partner resources that can help suppliers diversify and grow to enter new supply chains.

“We are proud to partner with the State of Michigan to equip manufacturers with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive, grow, and lead in an evolving industrial landscape,” said CEO of Next Street, Charisse Conanan Johnson. “The MI Hub for Manufacturers is a powerful example of public-private partnership—bringing together government, philanthropy, industry, and community organizations to deliver real value to small and mid-sized businesses. Equitable economic growth starts by unlocking the full potential of our local supply chains, and Michigan is setting the standard for what that looks like.”

The 2024 Clean Jobs America Report stated that clean energy businesses in Michigan added more than 5,200 workers and now employ 127,690 Michiganders. According to Clean Jobs Midwest and Climate Power, the state is projected to add 167,000 clean energy jobs over the next decade, continuing Michigan’s leadership as the no. 1 state in the nation for IRA-funded projects that have resulted in more than $25B in new investments and over 21,400 new jobs across the state.

“The Community and Worker Economic Transition Office will help ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy,” Glenn Stevens Jr., Executive Director, MichAuto at the Detroit Regional Chamber. “This work resonates strongly with MichAuto’s mission to ensure the state’s signature automotive and mobility industry, Michigan, and its workers continue to lead the world in automotive manufacturing and innovation well into the future.”

The Community & Worker Economic Transition Office was created as part of a historic package of clean energy and climate bills passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Whitmer in 2023. The office will ensure communities, workers and employers have the support they need to proactively prepare for, benefit from, and shape Michigan’s future economy.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright is a former Colorado oil and gas executive who calls himself a climate realist. He acknowledges that the planet is getting warmer but doesn't believe it's a crisis. Now he's leading a department that's charged with developing new climate-friendly energy sources. Sam Brasch of Colorado Public Radio has this report.

SAM BRASCH, BYLINE: This spring, Wright returned to Colorado, where he built his fortune leading a company offering fracking tech for the oil and gas industry. His first stop? The National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: I had a tremendous day. Tremendous day at NREL today.

BRASCH: The lab focuses on renewables like wind and solar. That research is a core function of the Department of Energy, and it made the agency central to Biden-era climate efforts. NREL is also near the location of the 2021 Marshall Fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado history. So during the visit, a reporter asked Wright about a post where he called concern about climate-driven wildfires just hype.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WRIGHT: The hype is climate alarmism, and it's a hundred percent. Calling climate change a crisis is just to say, I'm not going to look at the science. I'm not going to look at the economics. I'm just going to run with the politics.

BRASCH: Wright says he's more pragmatic. He acknowledges burning fossil fuels is heating the planet but says that's a manageable problem.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WRIGHT: Like, it's a real physical phenomenon. It's worth understanding a little bit. But to call it a crisis and point to disasters and say that that's climate change, that's to say, I'm not going to do my homework.

BRASCH: Wright often argues disasters like hurricanes and wildfires haven't gotten more frequent. That's despite a scientific consensus that climate change is contributing to more extreme weather events. Wright didn't respond to multiple interview requests for this story, but he's spent years making a consistent point - the benefits of fossil fuels outweigh climate impacts. In 2021, the outdoor brand The North Face declined to sell jackets to an oil and gas firm, citing climate concerns. Wright responded with an ad campaign, calling the company hypocrites.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WRIGHT: The great majority of North Face's products - jackets, backpacks, outdoor pants, shirts, shoes, hats, et cetera - are dominantly made out of the oil and gas that we so proudly produce.

BRASCH: And the YouTube videos and billboards carried the same message.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WRIGHT: So thank you, North Face. And you're welcome.

BRASCH: The spat landed Wright on Fox News. In later podcasts and talks, he argued fossil fuels have pulled billions out of poverty and remain essential to modern life.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WRIGHT: All these fancy materials, and we can fly around the planet and ride - drive a car to go visit Grandma for dinner a hundred miles away. These were just unimaginable before the arrival of fossil fuels.

BRASCH: Scott Denning is a climate scientist at Colorado State University who debated Wright in 2015.

SCOTT DENNING: What he's implying, without even really claiming it, is that the only way we can continue to live modern lives is to continue digging up 10 billion tons of carbon a year and setting them on fire forever and ever, which is simply not true. That's just malarkey.

BRASCH: Denning says the world now has more energy options, and Wright downplays the risks of living on a hotter planet.

DENNING: It's pretty naive to say, oh, no, we could just turn the temperatures up to, like, south Texas around here in Colorado, and we won't have any impacts on water, on fire, on drought, on livestock, on forestry. I mean, come on.

BRASCH: But some clean energy advocates are more hopeful about Wright, pointing out he often says the country needs abundant energy from multiple sources. Sure, his company played a key role in the recent shale gas boom, but he's also invested in more climate-friendly alternatives, like geothermal and nuclear. That's good news for Jigar Shah, who led an office focused on green tech under President Biden.

JIGAR SHAH: Chris Wright knows better than anyone that shale has plateaued, right? And so now we need to diversify where we're getting our energy from, and we need nuclear. We need geothermal. We need these other technologies.

BRASCH: And that's what the Department of Energy has been working on. But so far, the Trump administration has opposed clean energy incentives and cut staff at the DOE. So even if Wright supports alternative energy research, Shah says it's not clear if he can pursue it.

Some Michiganders have questioned whether DTE needs the rate increase recently requested.

Advocacy groups — and a state representative — are planning to raise concerns about the Michigan Public Service Commission and proposed utility rate hikes at a rally Thursday in Detroit, an hour before the regulatory agency's meeting.

The rally is set to start at 5 p.m. at Cadillac Place, 3022 W. Grand Blvd., Detroit, where the commission's town hall-style meeting is scheduled as part of an ongoing, legally required process of looking at ways the commission can improve public participation in proceedings.

The meeting, set for 6-8 p.m., in Room L-150, is expected to include all three commissioners, chair Dan Scripps, Katherine Peretick and Alessandra Carreon, as well as staff, who are expected to be on hand to hear the public's ideas.

The Michigan League of Conservation Voters, the non-partisan political environmental organization which announced the rally on Wednesday, said the rally is an opportunity to ""voice concerns about utility rates"" and other issues.

""Rallygoers will speak out about high energy bills, poor reliability and the powerful influence monopoly utility companies DTE and Consumers Energy hold in Lansing,"" the league said, adding the aim is to ""call out the outsized influence of utility companies on lawmakers, high rates, poor reliability and the need to better hold them accountable.""

In addition to its members, the league said it is expecting representatives from Clean Water Action, Detroit Action, Michigan United Action, Voters Not Politicians, and State Rep. Donavan McKinney, D-Detroit, who is also running for Congress, at the rally.

McKinney, who has been critical of DTE's spending on advertising as unnecessary because it is a virtual monopoly and executive benefits, told the Free Press he is concerned about the rate increase proposal. He also, he said, is working on legislation to continue to require the commission to be more accessible by holding meetings outside Lansing.

""I'll be there for a little bit today,"" he said Thursday, adding that an increase in utility bills is too burdensome to his constituents. ""We just want to see the commission hold our utilities accountable.""

Scripps, who spoke to the Free Press on Wednesday, said he was unaware of the rally, but welcomed the chance to engage with Michiganders in person or by phone, email or mail to hear concerns, complaints or answer questions.

Over the last few years, he added, the commission has tried to do more to be accessible to Michiganders, including holding meetings throughout the state in cities outside Lansing that would be more convenient for people to attend.

Other groups, he said, have used commission meetings as an opportunity to organize.

There is no set agenda for the meeting other than remarks from the commissioners, representatives from the attorney general’s office and the Utility Consumer Participation Board, and depending on turnout, group conversations, a commission spokesman said.

The commissioners are appointed by the governor to staggered terms.

DTE rate hikes are on the minds of utility customers because the commission is in the process of reviewing a rate hike of $574 million, more than twice what it granted DTE just months ago — and, if approved, it would result in higher electricity bills for customers.

Scripps said the commission will review DTE's request, line by line.

Some Michiganders, including Michigan's attorney general, have questioned the rate increases and whether additional revenue will benefit customers or is aimed at improving the bottom line to make the company more attractive to investors.

""At some point, we have to ask how long utility companies like DTE and Consumers Energy will be allowed to treat customer bills and our energy rates like a blank check,"" Nessel said in an April press release. ""My office will carefully scrutinize this rate hike request.""

In separate investigations, the Free Press has scrutinized the commission. One report in late 2023 looked into whether the commission and the utilities it regulates were too cozy. Last year, another reported on how the agency handled consumer complaints.

Critics of the commission said its little-known formal complaint process for resolving grievances with a public utility was intimidating and difficult to navigate and placed the burden of proof on the consumer.

Scripps, who is an attorney, explained that the commission, like any government organization, seeks to balance various competing perspectives and interests, including those between the public and the utilities.

In addition, Scripps said, in an effort to be fair, the commission is required to follow nuanced rules that can limit some conversations with parties outside the formal process on issues the commission is deciding.

• Q1 clean power deployment totaled 7.4 GW in 2025, representing $10 billion in domestic investment

• Battery storage achieves record Q1 installations, surpassing 30 GW total capacity and strengthening grid reliability for growing power demands

• Project pipeline climbs to record levels, signaling robust future growth

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 29, 2025 – The American Clean Power Association (ACP) today released its Q1 2025 Clean Power Quarterly Market Report, showing continued strong private sector investment in domestic energy production. U.S. developers installed 7.4 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar, wind, and storage capacity in the first quarter, marking the second-strongest start to a year on record and demonstrating strong market-driven demand for reliable, affordable domestic energy resources.

The industry’s growth is particularly strong in Republican-leaning states, where domestic manufacturing and energy production has created nearly 650,000 direct and indirect jobs and generates $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue and payments to landowners in rural communities.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale. With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet. “We have the technology, investment capital, and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline. The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Key Highlights

Total Installed Capacity: U.S. clean power capacity reached 320+ GW in Q1 2025, enough to power nearly 80 million American homes.

Strong Q1 Installations: 7.4 GW of new capacity came online, making it the second-strongest Q1 on record. The 115 project phases that came online in Q1 total $10 billion of private investment into the U.S. energy infrastructure.

Record-Breaking Storage Growth: Battery storage capacity surpassed 30 GW nationwide, representing a 65% increase year-over-year, with Q1 2025 setting a new first-quarter record at 1,602 MW.

Robust Project Pipeline: The development pipeline grew 12% year-over-year to reach 184,418 MW, with storage and wind pipelines growing 57% and 24% respectively. This represents $328 billion in project investment if everything in the pipeline is built. (Projects under construction or in advance stages of development (pipeline) are typically fully permitted projects. The growth of the pipeline does not signal any advances in the volume of projects receiving permits.)

Technology Mix: Q1 additions included 4,459 MW of utility-scale solar, 1,602 MW of storage, and 1,327 MW of land-based wind.

Leading States:

Eight of the top ten states for Q1 clean power additions voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election.

Texas leads the nation in clean power, with a portfolio reaching 80+ GW—a 20% increase from Q1 2024—and ranks first in utility-scale solar (28 GW) and land-based wind (43 GW) capacity.

Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity in just one quarter, while adding 435 MW of new solar capacity.

Powering America’s Economic Growth

With utility-scale clean power now exceeding 320 GW nationwide—enough to power nearly 80 million American homes—the data shows how rapidly private companies are responding to increasing power demands from manufacturing expansion, data centers, and AI development.

Texas, the nation’s energy leader, saw its clean power portfolio grow more than 20% since Q1 2024 to surpass 80 GW. The massive investment into clean power in the Lone Star State generates $1.3 billion annually in local tax revenue and land-lease payments and helps fuel the 125,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs created by the industry for Texans.

Strengthening Grid Reliability

Battery storage achieved its strongest Q1 on record with 1.6 GW installed, pushing total U.S. storage capacity above 30 GW—a 65% increase from Q1 2024. This rapid deployment of energy storage strengthens grid reliability, providing critical backup power for American businesses and homes.

Growing Pipeline Signals Confidence

The clean power development pipeline grew 12% year-over-year to reach 184 GW, signaling continued job creation and private investment across America. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by storage and wind: the storage pipeline grew 57% year-over-year to near 50 GW, and the land-based wind pipeline increased by 24% to 28 GW. These market-driven investments reflect growing demand for reliable, affordable domestic energy from utilities and major American companies.

LAWRENCEVILLE, Ill., May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA's Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company's broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)'s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

""This project is a testament to what's possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,"" said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. ""From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we're proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.""

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL's manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA's largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company's ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

""We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we're taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. ""We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.""

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project's final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA's own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an ""energy community,"" designated due to the area's unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

""From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,"" said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. ""The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.""

A lower court ruled the government’s review was inadequate because it did not fully consider the impacts of increased oil production and refining that could occur as a result of the railway project. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, disagreed.

“When the effects of an agency action arise from a separate project—for example, a possible future project or one that is geographically distinct from the project at hand—NEPA does not require the agency to evaluate the effects of that separate project,” he wrote.

However, he wrote that environmental review “may” encompass the indirect impacts of a specific project.

“The environmental effects of the project at issue may fall within NEPA even if those effects might extend outside the geographical territory of the project or might materialize later in time—for example, run-off into a river that flows many miles from the project and affects fish populations elsewhere, or emissions that travel downwind and predictably pollute other areas,” he wrote.

“But if the project at issue might lead to the construction or increased use of a separate project—for example, a housing development that might someday be built near a highway—the agency need not consider the environmental effects of that separate project,” he wrote.

The opinion also reins in the power of federal courts to block projects along similar grounds.

“NEPA does not allow courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand,” it said.

Kavanaugh was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a separate, concurring opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case.

The court’s liberal justices ultimately reached the same conclusion as their conservative counterparts — that the board did not need to consider the environmental impacts of drilling upstream or refining downstream.

“The [Surface Transportation] Board had no authority to reject petitioners’ application on account of the harms third parties would cause with products transported on the proposed railway,” Sotomayor wrote.

“The majority takes a different path, unnecessarily grounding its analysis largely in matters of policy,” she added.

The proposed railroad at the center of the case is called the Uinta Basin Railway.

The project, which was approved by the Surface Transportation Board during the Biden administration in 2021, is an 88-mile rail line that would connect Utah’s Uinta Basin to a national tran network that would ultimately enable it to get to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.

Environmental groups and a county in Colorado sued over the Transportation Board’s decision, arguing that the board’s review of the project was inadequate.

The consequences of the court’s decision could reach well beyond railways, limiting climate change considerations of various projects as additional fossil fuel production now may not be considered an impact of building a pipeline or export terminal.

“Regrettably, the Supreme Court has scored one for the oil companies who don’t want you to look too closely at the harm their product will do to Black and Brown communities in Cancer Alley,” said Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff in a written statement in response to the decision.

“Fossil fuel infrastructure projects do not exist in a vacuum and have far-reaching impacts on communities, especially those on the frontlines of climate change or those who face serious health harms from increased pollution,” Shoaff added.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Montana, argues that three of the executive orders are unconstitutional and would cripple the clean energy industry, suppress climate science and worsen global warming.
They say the executive orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty by infringing on their health, safety and prospects for the future.
Further, they argue that the orders constitute executive overreach, because the president cannot unilaterally override federal laws like the Clean Air Act.
Our Children’s Trust said the new case was different because it is focused on specific executive orders and their implementation in recent months.","Young people who sued state governments over climate change have begun a legal challenge aimed at President Trump’s spate of executive orders on climate and the environment.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Montana, argues that three of the executive orders are unconstitutional and would cripple the clean energy industry, suppress climate science and worsen global warming.

The 22 plaintiffs, ranging in age from seven to 25 years old, are mostly from Montana, as well as Hawaii, Oregon, and other states, and are represented by the nonprofit legal group Our Children’s Trust. That group has notched two important legal victories in recent years, winning cases against the state of Montana and the Hawaii Department of Transportation.

“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” said Eva Lighthiser, 19, the named plaintiff. “I’m not suing because I want to. I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line.”

The plaintiffs argue that they are already experiencing harms from a warming planet in the form of wildfires, drought and hurricanes, and that Mr. Trump’s executive orders will make conditions even worse. They say the executive orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights to life and liberty by infringing on their health, safety and prospects for the future.

Further, they argue that the orders constitute executive overreach, because the president cannot unilaterally override federal laws like the Clean Air Act.

The executive orders in question include those declaring a “National Energy Emergency,” directing agencies to “Unleash American Energy,” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.”

The complaint points to immediate consequences from the executive orders, like exempting the Colstrip coal-fired power plant in Montana from pollution rules. The aging plant emits more harmful fine particulate matter pollution, or soot, than any other power plant in the nation, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. A Biden-era rule would have compelled the facility, the only coal plant in the country to lack modern pollution controls, to install new equipment, but it received an exemption from the Trump administration last month.

Several of the plaintiffs live near the plant or a mine that provides it with coal, or along the facilities’ transport routes, said Julia Olson, founder of Our Children’s Trust.

The suit names Mr. Trump and several cabinet secretaries and agencies, including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; and Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator.

The Interior Department and the E.P.A. both declined to discuss pending litigation. The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taylor Rogers, a spokeswoman for the White House, said, “The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security, which is why they elected President Trump in a landslide victory to restore America’s energy dominance.”

The complaint also takes aim at the Trump administration’s cuts to federal climate research projects like the National Climate Assessment, which is the government’s flagship report on how global warming is affecting the country. The report is required by Congress but last month the administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been working on the latest version.

“In order for them to protect their rights, they need science,” Ms. Olson said of the young people.

One of the plaintiffs is Rikki Held, 24. She was also the named plaintiff in the Montana case, in which the Montana Supreme Court agreed that the state’s energy policies had violated Montanans’ constitutional right to a clean environment.

Ms. Held said her science career had been inspired by the U.S. Geological Survey researchers who would visit her family’s land to study the Powder River. That agency is facing significant reductions under the Trump administration’s proposed budget.

In an interview from Kenya, Ms. Held said that her family had endured numerous effects of a warming planet, including increased wildfires. That affects livestock, the economy and the food systems that she and her neighbors rely on, she said.

“With all the wildfires, there’s smoke in the air that affects health,” she said. “Especially for ranchers, you don’t have an option to stay inside. You have to go out and work, take care of your livestock. I’ve been out fencing in 110 degree days, which is a record-breaking temperature from my area. In 2021, we had two or three of those days, and you just have to be out in the heat and keep working, because you don’t have another choice.”

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the orders unconstitutional, block their implementation and protect the rights of youth as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and their respective state constitutions.

Our Children’s Trust was joined in filing the suit by Gregory Law Group of California, McGarvey Law of Montana and Public Justice, a public interest law firm in Washington.

Another case by Our Children’s Trust filed in 2015, Juliana v. United States, was described as a legal landmark, but was dismissed by a federal appellate court. In March, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.

That suit argued that the federal government had violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs with policies that encouraged the use of fossil fuels over many decades. In dismissing the case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that courts were not the right venue to address climate change. Our Children’s Trust said the new case was different because it is focused on specific executive orders and their implementation in recent months.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/29/multimedia/29CLI-TRUMP-EO-SUIT-mbgz/29CLI-TRUMP-EO-SUIT-mbgz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 13:20:06.115986

The ruling limits the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law in all sorts of settings.
Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing for five justices, said that many lower courts had dictated that the environmental impact statements required by a 1970 federal law, the National Environmental Policy Act, be needlessly elaborate.

The ruling limits the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law in all sorts of settings.

The proposed railway would connect oil fields in the Uinta Basin in northeast Utah to a national rail network that runs next to the Colorado River and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing for five justices, said that many lower courts had dictated that the environmental impact statements required by a 1970 federal law, the National Environmental Policy Act, be needlessly elaborate.

“The goal of the law,” he wrote, “is to inform agency decision making, not to paralyze it.”

The court’s three liberal members agreed with the decision’s bottom line but on narrower grounds. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch was recused.

Environmental groups reacted to the ruling with alarm.

“This disastrous decision to undermine our nation’s bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify and people will be less healthy,” Wendy Park, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.

The Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates rail transportation, approved the Utah project in 2021 after conducting a review that yielded a 3,600-page report. Environmental groups and a Colorado county sued, saying the report had not taken account of some ways in which the railway could do harm to the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled for the challengers, saying the agency had not considered all the “reasonably foreseeable” results of the project.

In reversing that ruling, Justice Kavanaugh said the appeals court had gone far beyond what the law required. “The D.C. Circuit,” he wrote, “ordered the board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.”

More generally, he said the way that the lower courts have used the law has thwarted economic progress. “A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development,” he wrote.

The consequences, Justice Kavanaugh said, have been vast.

“Fewer projects make it to the finish line,” he wrote. “Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line.”

“Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary,” he went on, adding: “And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers and the like.”

Justice Kavanaugh said the detailed reports had been used “by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects.”

He noted that some groups had even cited the law to fight “clean-energy projects.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. She said the majority had ruled too broadly, “unnecessarily grounding its analysis largely in matters of policy.”

But Justice Sotomayor agreed with an aspect of the majority’s reasoning. “I agree with the court that the Surface Transportation Board would not be responsible for the harms caused by the oil industry,” she wrote, “even though the railway it approved would deliver oil to refineries and spur drilling in the Uinta Basin.”

Paul D. Clement, a lawyer representing seven Utah counties that support the project, told the justices when the case was argued in December that the National Environmental Policy Act was “the single most litigated environmental statute.”

He added that the board had acted responsibly.

“It consulted with dozens of agencies, considered every proximate effect and ordered 91 mitigation measures,” he said, referring to measures intended to, among other things, dampen noise pollution and protect wildlife. “Eighty-eight miles of track should not require more than 3,600 pages of environmental analysis.”

William M. Jay, a lawyer for the challengers, said at the argument that the report did not consider all the reasonably foreseeable results of the project, like oil spills and sparks that can cause wildfires, as required by the federal law.

The case, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colo., No. 23-975, was decided by an eight-member court after Justice Gorsuch recused himself, apparently over concerns that his ties to Philip F. Anschutz gave rise to a conflict of interest. Neither Mr. Anschutz, a billionaire and Republican donor, nor his companies are parties to the case, and the letter announcing Justice Gorsuch’s recusal gave no reasons.

But the proposed railway could benefit companies in which Mr. Anschutz has an interest. Justice Gorsuch represented Mr. Anschutz and his companies as a lawyer, benefited from his support when he was being considered for a seat on an appeals court and once served as a keynote speaker at an annual party at his ranch.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/29/multimedia/29dc-scotus-gbtl/29dc-scotus-gbtl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 13:20:40.578769

The biofuels industry disagrees.
“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, US president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj.
“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.
“We go back to the domestic markets, and developing domestic uses.” ___ With assistance from Isis Almeida, Michael Hirtzer and Philip Tabuas.","After losing their biggest export market due to Donald Trump’s trade wars, US farmers are now counting on the president’s support for biofuels to prevent their next crop from piling up in storage.

The administration is set to soon unveil a plan for how much crop-based biofuels will be blended into fossil fuels starting next year. A higher mandate, still opposed by some in the oil industry, would create a much needed outlet for crops after tariffs hit China - the top commodities buyer simply has no orders for corn, soybeans or wheat from the next harvest on its books, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is also president of the American Soybean Association, said of the upcoming biofuels mandate. “I can store one good crop, I can’t store multiple years.”

Trump instigated a $28 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the economic standoff with Beijing during his first term. While his administration is considering similar plans again, so far he has only pledged to find domestic markets to compensate for lost sales abroad.

Boosting demand at home is a key priority for growers, industry groups and some of the top agricultural commodity traders. That’s because overseas sales of soybeans from the next crop are currently running 79% below the average of the past five years, USDA data showed. Corn sales are 49% lower.

The US farm economy was already struggling before Trump’s trade disputes. Bumper crops globally boosted supplies and sent a Bloomberg gauge of grain prices tumbling more than 40% since a 2022 peak.

For Trump and the Republican party, reinforcing the farmer vote ahead of next year’s midterm elections will be key. American growers have been a loyal constituency, but some cracks in that support have started to emerge.

An AgWeb poll of almost 3,000 farmers earlier this year revealed that 54% were against Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating strategy. A group of growers from Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi also sued the administration after the USDA canceled grants under a program to install solar panels.

The April Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer found that 56% of respondents expect tariffs to have a negative or very negative impact on farm income this year. Still, 70% said the policy will strengthen the US agricultural economy in the long-term.

Domestic demand

“If we’re going to get behind this America First policy, let’s make sure that we have a great domestic policy strategy,” said Lucas Lentsch, a North Dakota farmer who heads the United Soybean Board. “Let’s make sure we’ve got good demand here at home.”

Creating more markets at home is easier said than done. The US cattle herd is already at the lowest since the 1950s, curbing demand for crops in feed rations. That’s leaving farmers reliant on the so-called renewable volume obligation, or RVOs - a rule that’s been controversial since being enshrined into law two decades ago to safeguard energy security.

Farmers benefit from a higher biofuels mandate, but oil refiners have historically opposed it. Some of that has since changed as Big Oil invested in biofuels in recent years as part of their decarbonization efforts.

“We need a robust RVO to keep US soybeans a profitable business to be in,” said Greg Anderson, who grows the oilseed in Nebraska.

Biofuel mandates

Agribusiness giants Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Bunge Global SA and Cargill Inc., as well as trade groups including the Clean Fuels Alliance America want the Environmental Protection Agency to set the RVO at no less than 5.25 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel starting next year, up 60% from 2025 levels.

Farm lobby groups and US Midwestern governors also want a mandate for US ethanol of at least the 15 billion gallons currently in place.

The American Petroleum Institute is also backing the requests.

“We’re certainly doing our job to push administration to help us and help the industry,” Christopher Cuddy, ADM’s president of carbohydrate solutions, said at a BMO conference in New York this month. “The most encouraging piece for me is the fact that we’re aligned with the Petroleum Institute, which at least in my time has never happened.”

Still, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents some refiners, is against it. The group argues the US isn’t selling enough gasoline to absorb so much ethanol and that there’s uncertainty over the amount of feedstock available to produce more renewable diesel and other biomass-based biofuels.

The biofuels industry disagrees. Randall Stuewe, chief executive officer of Darling Ingredients Inc., said the previous quotas set under former President Joe Biden were far too low. The company’s Diamond Green Diesel venture with Valero Energy Corp. is a top producer of renewable fuels.

That led to a number of factory closures. Biodiesel plants in the US produced at just 51% of capacity in the year through April, while facilities that make renewable diesel - a fuel that’s chemically identical to its fossil fuel peer - ran at a rate of 72%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Project Tracker.

“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, US president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj. “Some companies are reducing run rates or shelving their investment plans for renewable fuels,” which will make it harder to curb emissions from heavy-duty industries, he said.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.

In a statement to Bloomberg, the EPA said it has already sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House and will make it available for public comment once the proposal is signed.

The US biofuels program “supports President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices,” the agency said.

A higher RVO is a chance to get domestic biofuels back up to normalized run rates of around 80%, said Brett Gibbs, a renewable energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who estimates the mandate will need to be at least 3.9 billion gallons to bring some facilities back online.

Trade uncertainty

It’s unclear how the EPA will balance the concerns of some refiners and the agriculture industry. And even as the president announced a truce with China, lowering tariffs for 90 days, uncertainty remains.

Sales of next season’s crops to Mexico and Japan, the second and third-largest soybean buyers, are lagging well behind historical levels for this time of year. And China continues to snap up supplies from rival Brazil.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has openly hinted at a bailout, and nearly two thirds of farmers in the March Purdue/CME barometer said aid was either likely or very likely. Still, many growers say they want to sell their crops instead of receiving aid.

“As a farmer, I’d rather receive it from the market,” said Philip Good, a Mississippi farmer who’s the chair of the United Soybean Board. “We go back to the domestic markets, and developing domestic uses.”

While air quality in California has improved over the years, experts fear a setback from the Senate’s action.
“This is, plain and simple, a vote against clean air to breathe,"" said Aaron Kressig, transportation electrification manager at Western Resource Advocates, in an emailed statement.
California and 10 other states formed a coalition to foster cleaner and more affordable vehicles, Newsom announced May 23.
Participating states include California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.","Dive Brief:

The U.S. Senate passed three joint resolutions May 22 nullifying California’s ability to set emissions standards for passenger cars, light duty vehicles and trucks that are stricter than national standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Auto and petroleum industry lobbyists targeted California’s Advanced Clean Car II regulations, adopted in 2022, which require all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the state to be zero-emission vehicles by the 2035 model year. Federal law set in 1990 allows 17 additional states and the District of Columbia to follow California’s regulations.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced the state’s intention to file a lawsuit blocking the congressional resolutions, which await the signature of President Donald Trump to become law.

Dive Insight:

California’s ability to set its own vehicle emissions standards stem from the 1967 Air Quality Act, passed at a time when smog and poor air quality often permeated the Los Angeles basin. While air quality in California has improved over the years, experts fear a setback from the Senate’s action.

“Public health could potentially suffer as a consequence,” said Michael Kleeman, a professor at the University of California, Davis, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

“This is, plain and simple, a vote against clean air to breathe,"" said Aaron Kressig, transportation electrification manager at Western Resource Advocates, in an emailed statement. He warned of potential lost days at school or work and premature deaths.

“Over 150 million people in the United States are already exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,” Steven Higashide, director of the Clean Transportation Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an emailed statement. “The standards are based on the best available science, and were finalized with extensive public input.”

Along with public health concerns, the debate around California’s emissions waivers include policy, auto and petroleum industry resistance and debate over states’ rights.

Republicans argue that California overstepped its prerogative.

“The California waivers rules are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply,” Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said May 20 in the Senate chamber.

Industry opponents of the emission waivers cheered the Senate’s action. “The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry lobbying group, said in a statement. Bozella noted the automakers key concern: “The problem really isn’t California. It’s the 11 states that adopted California’s rules without the same level of readiness for EV sales requirements of this magnitude.”

Petroleum industry leaders weighed in May 23 with a joint statement. “The United States Senate delivered a victory for American consumers, manufacturers, and U.S. energy security by voting to overturn the prior administration’s EPA rule authorizing California’s gas car ban and preventing its spread across our country,” said American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson and American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers in a published statement.

California and 10 other states formed a coalition to foster cleaner and more affordable vehicles, Newsom announced May 23. Led by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 24 governors, the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition said in a news release that it would “consider next steps for our clean vehicle programs” and work to preserve the states’ authority under the Clean Air Act. Participating states include California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

“The fact remains that states have the legal right under the Clean Air Act to protect their residents from vehicle pollution,” Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp said in an emailed statement.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nquuOds9gzzghEdBWefL8kQ37OKPf0nbieYGcEwwP-Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy03MjU5NTQ1Mi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-29 13:20:48.484559

LAWRENCEVILLE, Ill., May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA's Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company's broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)'s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

""This project is a testament to what's possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,"" said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. ""From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we're proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.""

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL's manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA's largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company's ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

""We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we're taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. ""We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.""

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project's final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA's own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an ""energy community,"" designated due to the area's unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

""From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,"" said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. ""The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.""

Governor Stein recently proposed a budget allocating $239 million towards strengthening infrastructure in western North Carolina. This proposal includes projects aimed at safeguarding against future disasters.

The governor expressed concern over Congress' potential repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. He warned that such a move could jeopardize tens of thousands of jobs by 2030 and billions of dollars in investments facilitated by tax credits related to clean energy and manufacturing. Additionally, repealing these credits could increase electricity costs for families by approximately $200 annually.

They're flying under the radar.,Tik Root,,,,,https://grist.org/climate-energy/report-finds-paper-mill-emissions-are-wildly-undercounted/,"But according to a new report, the mill spews more nitrogen oxide, methane, and greenhouse gases than is generally known.
It’s ash, it’s nasty, and it’s all over the place all of the time,” Robin Brown, a 65-year-old resident who lives near the mill, told the researchers.
And, because of Environmental Protection Agency reporting rules, the report found that climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from those mills are being undercounted by some 350 percent.
The EPA houses the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, where facilities report their emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.
But EPA facility totals don’t include what are called biogenic CO2 emissions, or those that come from “natural sources” such as wood, which is a primary fuel for the paper industry.","For more than a century, Covington, Virginia has had one dominating feature: its paper mill. Smokestacks tower over the community of 5,500, many of whom work there. But according to a new report, the mill spews more nitrogen oxide, methane, and greenhouse gases than is generally known.

“The snow is not white here. It’s ash, it’s nasty, and it’s all over the place all of the time,” Robin Brown, a 65-year-old resident who lives near the mill, told the researchers. “And there’s that funky odor, like rotten eggs. It’s all you can smell.”

The Covington mill is among the industry’s worst polluters, according to a report the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, or EIP, released today. It detailed similar issues at 185 such facilities nationwide. And, because of Environmental Protection Agency reporting rules, the report found that climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from those mills are being undercounted by some 350 percent.

The EPA houses the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, where facilities report their emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. But EPA facility totals don’t include what are called biogenic CO2 emissions, or those that come from “natural sources” such as wood, which is a primary fuel for the paper industry.

According to the EIP investigation, the 10 pulp and paper mills that reported the most greenhouse gases in 2023 were able to lower their reported “total” emissions by between 61 and 90 percent each because they burned wood products. Biogenic emission data is buried deeper within EPA data and, when those emissions are included, the largest paper mills can emit as much as a large oil refinery, the report noted.

“It masks the true impact of the industry,” said Courtney Bernhardt, director of research for EIP and an author of the report. “It hides the fact that there is an urgent need to address.”

The American Forest & Paper Association, which represents the industry, did not respond to a request for an interview. The EPA told Grist it would review the report. Smurfit West Rock, which owns the mill in Covington, did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

EIP also used data from the National Emissions Inventory, an annual estimate of the output of gases like sulfur dioxide, methane, carbon dioxide, and dozens of others. One of the major reasons that pollution levels are so high, Bernhardt explained, is that many paper plants continue using outdated equipment that is far less efficient than modern machinery. The boiler at the Covington mill, for example, is 85 years old. The average age across the 185 facilities that the report found data for was 41 years.

The Clean Air Act effectively grandfathers in the equipment until it comes time to replace it, and the emissions reductions can be stark when that happens. Bernhardt cited the Ahlstrom’s Thilmany Mill in Wisconsin as an example. The plant, built in 1883, replaced its boiler in 2020 and emissions of sulfur dioxide, a health-harming air pollutant, fell from 4,800 tons to 410 tons. A facility in Washington saw an 87 percent drop and one in Georgia plummeted 96 percent.

“There’s going to be a large number of these plants that are going to need to install new boilers [in the next decade],” said Bernhardt. She would like them to move toward more efficient options, especially those that run on electricity derived from clean energy instead of natural gas. But it’s unclear exactly how, or how quickly, any transition will unfold.

“Developing a technology that can both be financially attractive and reduce carbon dioxide emissions is not easy,” said Sunkyu Park, a professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in pulp and paper processing. His research focuses on trying to develop a more efficient “recover boiler,” which accounts for the majority of CO2 emissions during production. He is studying electric options, as well as those that use less natural gas. His work remains at very early stages, but the goal is that “eventually industry can implement that technology.”

In the meantime, Bernhardt hopes the EIP’s report can focus attention on cleaning up an industry that is often seen as an alternative to plastics, but carries its own baggage.

“We need paper. We need cardboard,” she said. “[But] there’s a lot of greenwashing that makes paper seem cleaner than it really is.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Paper-Plant.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-29 13:21:16.660457

In all, the world’s richest 10% are responsible for nearly two-thirds of global warming since 1990.
Lessening those harms can be difficult for already under-resourced Black communities, said Gabrielle Cole, a St. Louis resident who lost her home to tornadoes earlier this month.
While millions of Black Americans fall into the world’s top 10%, the median income for Black Americans is $43,000, roughly $15,000 less than white Americans.
That means a “stronger critique of the industries driving climate change — like the transportation and building sectors — and of wealthy individuals.”","In January, a relentless wave of wildfires tore through Los Angeles, reducing a historic Black community to ash and claiming 29 lives. Later that month, a rare winter storm brought heavy snow to the Southeast and the Gulf Coast. Eleven people perished.

Then, in March, more than 100 tornadoes ripped through the South in two days, leaving 42 dead across eight states. Weeks later, rain and extensive flooding soaked the region, resulting in hundreds of water rescues and 25 deaths.

All of these disasters — from wildfires to floods and tornadoes — have connections to global warming. In America, researchers say, they all are connected to how much money is in your bank account, too.

A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change this month found that emissions from the wealthiest Americans have led to increased heat waves and flooding, particularly in communities of color. Scientists say that the findings underscore an often overlooked aspect of the climate crisis — that those least responsible for global warming often face the most severe impacts of environmental change.

Or, put another way: Black communities in the United States are bearing the brunt of a climate crisis that they did little to cause.

And, researchers say, the toll of climate change also disproportionately costs Black Americans their lives.

Since 1999, Black people have died from natural disasters and extreme weather, at a rate nearly twice as high as white people. In the South, it is even more pronounced, with Black people dying at a rate in some states that is more than three times higher than for white people.

“This is not an academic discussion — it’s about the real impacts of the climate crisis today,” said Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, a researcher with the policy group Climate Analytics and a co-author of the Nature Climate Change study.

Schleussner and his fellow researchers found that emissions from the wealthiest Americans have directly caused these increased heat waves, winter storms, and flooding. In all, the world’s richest 10% are responsible for nearly two-thirds of global warming since 1990. Yet it is neighborhoods like those in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and St. Louis — where Black families emit far less climate change-causing carbon — who are left to pick up the pieces after each calamity.

The disasters are deadly — even for those that survive them. They’ve left thousands of Black families in the aftermath without housing and jobs. And with every passing day, researchers say, a disproportionate number of Black families are grappling with punishing heat, flooding, and pollution — threats that are growing more severe each year.

“Climate action that doesn’t address the outsize responsibilities of the wealthiest members of society risks missing one of the most powerful levers we have to reduce future harm,” Schleussner said.

Lessening those harms can be difficult for already under-resourced Black communities, said Gabrielle Cole, a St. Louis resident who lost her home to tornadoes earlier this month.

“We are just unprepared,” said Cole. “We are unprepared as a community, and climate change and weather events like this are mainly impacting predominantly Black areas, predominantly underserved communities.”

Scientists say that the devastation caused by global warming is becoming increasingly common. Last year, the U.S. experienced 27 separate weather and climate disasters with damages of at least $1 billion each, making it the second-highest year on record, just behind 2023, which saw 28 such events. In all, this decade has seen about 23 disasters per year with damages at $1 billion or more. In comparison, even when accounting for inflation, the increase is dramatic. The 1980s averaged 3.3 per year, the 1990s averaged 5.7, the 2000s averaged 6.7, and the 2010s averaged 13.1.

The pattern is clear: As the climate crisis accelerates, it magnifies long-standing racial and economic inequities, making survival and recovery even harder for those with the fewest resources, Cole said.

Black neighborhoods are disproportionately exposed to extreme weather, receive less disaster recovery aid, and face steeper barriers to recovery. After experiencing roof damage during a 2024 storm, Cole’s insurance company told her they’d stop insuring her home in June 2025. Then she lost her home altogether to a tornado. Nearly 30 people died during the storm system.

“It comes at us from all directions,” she said, first with the storms and then the fallout. “There’s a lot of people strategizing on how to acquire Black land after these events, and to take these homes from us in a vulnerable state.”

Below, you can click through a story map that outlines the real life impacts of climate change on Black communities.

The world’s wealthiest 10% of people — defined as those who earn at least $47,000 per year — contributed seven times more to the rise in monthly heat extremes around the world than the global average. While millions of Black Americans fall into the world’s top 10%, the median income for Black Americans is $43,000, roughly $15,000 less than white Americans. That means more than half of Black adults are making less than $47,000 per year.

Several studies show that Black households emit less carbon per capita than white households, and white households are the largest emitters of greenhouse gas in the country.

“This is something that we’ve known for a long time through our experience,” said Lemir Teron, an associate professor in Howard University’s Department of Earth, Environment, and Equity. “Black Americans, at least amongst Americans, contribute much less to climate change, but we feel it the most.”

Teron, who was not part of the study’s research team, said that the findings show that true responsibility “lies across all sectors, especially those with the largest environmental impact,” he added. That means a “stronger critique of the industries driving climate change — like the transportation and building sectors — and of wealthy individuals.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2208464306-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-29 13:22:13.293931

In a move that will undoubtedly have major repercussions for America’s nascent electric vehicle industry, the U.S. House has voted to eliminate federal EV tax credits. These credits of up to $7,500 were critical to boosting electric vehicle adoption in the country, and their loss will significantly affect battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in the U.S.

President Trump was a vocal critic of the Biden administration’s investments in electric vehicles and public charging infrastructure before returning to the White House for a second term. He referred to former President Biden’s focus on renewable energy as the “green new scam” and vowed to pull back federal funds dedicated to climate action if elected. The GOP president began undoing the previous administration’s climate-related policies as soon as he took office, eventually instructing states to stop constructing public EV charging infrastructure using federal funds.

The GOP administration has now delivered a potentially catastrophic blow to the country’s fledgling electric vehicle market by eliminating the federal tax credits that allowed thousands of Americans to buy electric cars. Without the $7,500 tax credit, interested buyers will have to dig deeper into their pockets if they want to purchase a battery electric car. Buyers who couldn’t afford an EV without the tax credit may opt for internal combustion engine (ICE) alternatives, slowing down the country’s transition to electric cars and contributing to air pollution.

House lawmakers have approved a bill to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit and other clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, just days after the Senate blocked California’s electric vehicle mandate by revoking a Biden-era waiver that allowed the state to set its own tailpipe emission standards.

Most carmakers in the country will lose the federal EV tax credit immediately, while those that haven’t sold 200,000 electric cars can retain the credit until December 31, 2026. The measure would also scrap the $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicle purchases and eliminate incentives for companies that build battery storage, wind, and solar energy projects. It will impose an annual $250 tax on electric vehicle owners (and $100 on hybrid owners) to help fund infrastructure and road improvements.

Trump’s vendetta against clean energy and electric cars poses a serious threat to America’s transition to a green economy. It could weaken several emerging industries, discourage innovation, and make the U.S. fall behind competitors like China and the EU, both of which are doubling down on clean energy to strengthen their economies and reduce emissions.

In an 8-0 ruling on Thursday authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court said the US Court of Appeals for the D.C.
The 1969 law is intended to assist federal agencies in decision making.

In an 8-0 ruling on Thursday authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court said the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit went too far when it required federal regulators to look at potential effects on Gulf Coast communities when considering approval of a rail line in Utah.

Any “environmental effects from highly regulated oil refineries along the Gulf Coast are well outside the scope of the 88-mile railroad project in rural Utah,” Kavanaugh wrote.

In doing so, the court emphasized that agencies are entitled to significant deference when deciding what kinds of environmental impacts they should be looking at under the National Environmental Policy Act. The 1969 law is intended to assist federal agencies in decision making.

The court contrasted that rule with its decision last year limiting the deference owed to agencies when interpreting ambiguous federal statutes. It’s the job of courts—not agencies—to interpret federal law, the justices said in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.

But the NEPA statute specifically grants discretion to the agency, the court said Thursday. “The bedrock principle of judicial review in NEPA cases can be stated in a word: Deference.”

The court lamented that NEPA had morphed beyond what Congress intended.

“NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects,” it said. “Citizens may not enlist the federal courts” in that way.

LAWRENCEVILLE, Ill., May 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Toyota Boshoku America (TBA), Onyx Renewables, and key project partners gathered today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of a 5.7-megawatt solar project that will fulfill 85% of electricity needs at TBA's Illinois plant with clean, affordable energy. The event featured remarks from the president of TBA, the local chamber of commerce, and representatives from project owner and operator Onyx Renewables as well as project partners Sol Systems and Nelnet Renewable Energy.

As energy prices rise and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, manufacturers across the U.S. are seeking more sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions. TBA recognized the need to both stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company's broader sustainability goals. TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)'s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement (PPA) without any upfront capital investment.

""This project is a testament to what's possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,"" said Anna Toenjes, Associate Vice President of Impact & Business Development at Sol Systems. ""From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we're proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.""

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL's manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA's largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company's ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

""We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we're taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Kenji Sugito, TBIL President. ""We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.""

""This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. ""We're proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.""

Onyx Renewables, a leading developer, owner, and operator of clean energy infrastructure, completed the project's final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

""This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,"" said Patty Rollin, Chief Commercial Officer at Onyx Renewables. ""Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.""

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA's own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an ""energy community,"" designated due to the area's unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

""From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,"" said Alyssa Martin, President of Nelnet Renewable Energy. ""The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.""

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a May 21st memorandum titled”

Clarification regarding the Application of Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification (“Memorandum”).

The Memorandum is transmitted from EPA Office of Water Acting Assistant Administrator Peggy Browne.

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act prohibits federal agencies from issuing permits or licenses that result in exceedance of water quality standards, or other applicable authorities, of the state. This provision of the Clean Water Act requires an applicant for a federal license or permit to provide a certification that any discharges from the facility will comply with applicable Water Quality Standards. If not provided, the federal permit or license may not be granted. Further, the states can impose certain conditions upon federal permits or licenses as a prerequisite to granting the permit or license.

If a state fails or refuses to act on a request for certification in a timely manner, the certification requirements are waived with respect to such federal applications.

Examples of federal licenses and permits that may require Section 401 Water Quality certifications include (but are not limited to):

Clean Water Act Section 404 Dredge and Fill Permits.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hydroelectric Licenses.

Clean Water Act Section 402 Pollutant Discharge Permits.

Natural Gas Pipeline Certificates issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The stated purpose of the May 21st EPA Memorandum is to address questions the federal agency states have been raised in regard to a rule promulgated in September 2023 (during the Biden Administration), addressing Section 401 certifications. It states that stakeholders raised questions about potential applications of the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.

By way of introduction, the Memorandum states in part:

…The purpose of this document is to reiterate the EPA’s longstanding position that states and Tribes must utilize CWA Section 401 only for its statutory purpose – to protect water quality – and not as a weapon to shut down projects for reasons with no basis in the statute or applicable regulations. A certifying authority’s evaluation is limited to considering adverse impacts to water quality, and only such impacts insofar as they prevent compliance with applicable water quality requirements.

This position arguably constitutes a narrowing of the activities that were potentially subject to the 401 certification process under the Biden Administration’s 2023 Rule promulgated by EPA.

The Memorandum also states in part:

…the regulations do not authorize a certification condition based on generalized concerns about water quality untethered to noncompliance with a specific applicable water quality requirement or requirements. It would be inconsistent with CWA Section 401 to deny or condition a certification based on potential impacts not connected to water quality (e.g., based solely on potential impacts to air quality, traffic, noise, project preference, or economic impacts that have no direct connection to water quality). If a certifying authority imposes certification conditions or denies certification for a reason or reasons such as these, then that certification decision would not comply with CWA Section 401 or the EPA’s regulations.

The Memorandum states that EPA will promulgate in the future a Federal Register notice a recommendations docket to identify additional areas of implementation challenges and regulatory uncertainty relate to the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 10:21:12.247685

While the DOE has not explicitly linked the cancellation to budgetary issues, the decision fits with a wider pattern of federal cost-cutting by DOGE. The Trump administration’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget includes major cuts to the DOE, including a $15.2bn reduction in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding, $2.6bn cut from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and $1.1bn cut from the Office of Science. This cuts by the Trump Admin have been met with considerable criticism.

However, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), which organises the Small Business Forum & Expo, did not link the cancellation to budget cuts. Instead, they said that the decision is part of a shift to hybrid and virtual initiatives.

The fact is that access to the EV revolution has not been as good for lower income people. Of course, that’s how tech transitions tend to go, but there are reasons why we’d really like it to be different with EVs — public health matters and the need to cut emissions urgently, for example. Let’s now look at some key potential solutions.

In the briefing, T&E identifies the following as four key social risk factors with the transition to EVs:

Dependence on private cars,

The pace of electrification,

The affordability of EVs (lower prices),

The level of transport vulnerability to rising fuel prices.

Also, these factors present themselves and mutate a bit depending on the location.

The question is how to address these challenges. These are T&E’s big three recommendations:

Accelerating electrification through inclusive support schemes, such as social leasing

Improving access to EVs for middle- and low-income households is crucial. Large-scale electrification of the vehicle fleet must be achieved by 2030 to avoid leaving significant segments of the population behind. The “social leasing” scheme initiated in France may serve as a model. It targets households excluded from the EV market and most vulnerable to fuel price volatility. Based on public subsidies, the scheme aims to remove financial barriers to access by offering EVs at affordable rental prices. Member States should include social leasing schemes in their National Climate Plans targeting most vulnerable groups.

Complementary measures to boost the second-hand EV market

Support schemes such as social leasing should be combined with mandatory targets for the greening of company car fleets across Europe. Since most new cars are bought for corporate fleets, and these vehicles typically enter the second-hand market within 3–4 years, this measure would more largely accelerate the availability of used EVs, making them more accessible to a broader population.

Reducing reliance on private cars through alternative mobility options

Policies must also strengthen the availability of public transport and active mobility. The reduction of car kilometres travelled should be a key performance indicator for policies. It will ensure effective savings for households and improved control over mobility-related expenses.

I love that first suggestion. Cars are not investments — they are money drains. Unfortunately, that tends to hit poor and less wealthy people more. They are forced to buy older, used cars because of the financial barriers to getting a new car, and then they end up having to pay an arm and a leg to repair and maintain and even just fuel up those older, worse cars. Forget tax credits and other incentives to purchase prices — bring down costs and barriers to entry through smart social leasing programs! That will also get a lot more EVs on the road, combined with other measures to get automakers to care and try.

Suggestions #2 and #3 are good too, but I think it’s #1 that is worth really highlighting as a unique approach that needs more attention and needs to spread. Let’s hope it gets more popular in Europe at least.

But, yes, do all the things!",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Original-21887-scenic-week-1-selects-16-scaled-e1720464691715.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 10:19:33.522951

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week's House bill effectively renders moot many of the law's incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

""The House's plan coupled with the administration's focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,"" E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president's desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner's closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies' plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

""If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I'm not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,"" said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county's position as a global energy leader.

The U.S. and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden's environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats' ""green new scam"" — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led ""American energy dominance"" agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent ""carbon leakage,"" or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi's energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2's tally.",https://img.manufacturing.net/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/05/Energy.683862e0bbcc4.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C397%2C3791%2C2132&w=1200,N,,2025-05-29 13:19:36.040999

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-29 13:44:10+00:00,The Colorado Sun,A Q&A on federal challenges to Colorado's clean energy track,"Michael Booth, Michael Booth Environment",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/05/29/colorado-clean-energy-fight-federal-subsidies/,"Second, the House forwarded to the Senate a budget that slashes most of the clean energy and climate change subsidies championed by the Biden and Obama administrations.
If the Senate doesn’t restore the subsidies, building solar farms, buying EVs and other clean energy staples will be much more expensive.
So we asked Colorado’s electrification and clean energy czar, Colorado Energy Office CEO Will Toor, for his take on last week’s warning signs.
Unless the Senate makes some major revisions, there would also be losses of quite a lot of the other electrification and clean energy subsidies that are out there.
And I think there will be a vigorous conversation over the next year about what it looks like to move past 2030, and think about potential 2040 clean energy targets.","Mid-May in Washington, D.C., brought some loud Trump administration warning shots for states like Colorado, where majorities of voters have pushed for clean energy alternatives and action on climate change.

First, the U.S. House and Senate voted to strip California — and states that have largely copied their rules — of the right to go further than EPA minimums in selling clean electric cars and trucks. Colorado’s Air Quality Control Commission renewed and expanded the state’s clean cars and trucks mandate in 2023. Those “waivers” to promote green energy are now dead unless revived by challenges in court.

Second, the House forwarded to the Senate a budget that slashes most of the clean energy and climate change subsidies championed by the Biden and Obama administrations. If the Senate doesn’t restore the subsidies, building solar farms, buying EVs and other clean energy staples will be much more expensive.

So we asked Colorado’s electrification and clean energy czar, Colorado Energy Office CEO Will Toor, for his take on last week’s warning signs.

Sun: People in the environmental community seem pretty shaken, not just by the budget, but the waiver votes, which went further on EVs than they had really expected. So, tell me if you think you can protect Colorado’s EV targets, and what you thought of the vote.

Toor: Certainly we were very, very disappointed to see the actions by Congress on the budget, and both the House and the Senate on the waivers that allowed states to enforce both clean car and clean truck standards. Just from a procedural perspective, it was a pretty clearly inappropriate use of the Congressional Review Act. Given that both the General Accounting Office and the Senate parliamentarian had ruled that, in line with all previous interpretations, that you couldn’t use the CRA for this purpose. And clearly, states should have the ability to take action to protect clean air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their state. So we’ll see where that heads, going forward. But it was a very disappointing action.

Sun: Have you consulted with the Colorado attorney general, and do you feel you can enforce Colorado’s rules in the meantime?

Toor: I think it is probably premature for me to speak to that. It’s worth noting that there’s not an immediate impact on Colorado. Our standards will start to come into effect in the 2027 model year. There’s a one-year gap in 2026 on the standards, during which manufacturers would be able to accumulate early action credits, but there’s no direct regulatory requirement.

The other thing that’s kind of interesting is, if you look at our existing clean car standards in the state, and then you look at actual EV adoption in the state, the actual market share has been far higher than the minimum regulatory requirements. Under the original clean car standards, the 2025 requirement translates into a real world market share requirement of 6-to-7% range for the share of new vehicles that need to be zero-emission vehicles. Whereas the actuals in Colorado over the last number of quarters has varied between about 25% and 30%, so about four times higher than the minimum. So we do think that consumer demand in Colorado and the strengths of state programs that are investing in infrastructure to make sure that people know they can get where they need to go and not have to worry about charging availability, and the state incentives that have supported EV adoption by consumers, and then the state incentives through things like the clean fleet enterprise that support adoption by business and local government — those vigorous programs have led to far higher sales than would be required by the regulations. I think what the regulations have done is to ensure that manufacturers bring all of their vehicles to Colorado. They’re important, but I think we are hopeful that our vigorous programs around education, incentives and infrastructure will continue to move the market.

Sun: Not to be Debbie Downer, but that brings us to the loss of $7,500 federal tax credit that helped boost a lot of those sales, that elimination is in the House-passed version of the budget. Unless the Senate makes some major revisions, there would also be losses of quite a lot of the other electrification and clean energy subsidies that are out there.

Toor: It is certainly the case that almost all of the headwinds that we see now are coming from the federal government, and we see that in multiple arenas. There’s the House version of budget reconciliation that removes the federal EV tax credit. We’ve seen it in the illegal act by the U.S. Department of Transportation to try to yank back national electric vehicle infrastructure funds that by act of Congress had a formula that said Colorado should get $57 million for that. And the vast majority of that has been frozen. That is an arena where we think that there is a clear case that is illegal. Colorado a couple of weeks ago, along with other states, took the lead on filing litigation to restore those funds. There’s also the tariffs. Obviously there’s so much uncertainty in the implementation of tariffs by the Trump administration. It’s hard to know where that’s going to go, but we certainly worry that the imposition of tariffs will essentially create a large tax on all new vehicles, but in particular electric vehicles, and right at a time when we’ve been moving closer and closer to cost parity, that may artificially drive up the cost of vehicles. So I don’t want to sugarcoat it. I think we are very concerned about all of the actions that both the administration and now potentially Congress are taking to hurt American competitiveness. Giving the electric vehicle leadership to Chinese manufacturers, rather than American manufacturers and consumers in this country. Some real worries there.

Sun: Do you have any confidence or comfort that the Senate will push to put back some of the important subsidies?

Toor: We are certainly hopeful that cooler and wiser heads will prevail in the Senate than in the House. It was incredibly disappointing to see the extent to which many members of Congress took actions that will hurt their own constituents in their own districts, and drive up the cost of energy, drive up the cost of vehicles, drive up pollution and reduce manufacturing investment in their own districts. But I’m hopeful that the Senate will take wiser action.

Sun: What else can Colorado do to protect these policies that a significant progressive majority of voters for some time now have put into place, step by step?

Toor: We will continue to see progress moving forward in Colorado, if you look at our greenhouse gas road map and think about the major sources of pollution in the state: the electricity industry, oil and gas vehicles, manufacturing, and burning fossil fuel in buildings. The majority of actions in most of those sectors can be taken at the state level. The federal government can put wind in our sails, or can create headwinds on those actions. But in most cases, it is ultimately state decision-making. As a state, we are the ones who adopt the rules for electric resource planning, and for the emission targets of our electric utilities. As the state, we are able to adopt the rules that regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. We have the authority to move forward on programs like the clean heat plan requirements for gas utilities, and setting energy codes and building performance standards. So while there certainly are things that the federal government can do to raise costs for consumers, and create obstacles to economic development, in most areas I don’t think that they’re able to block state action.

Sun: There have been rumblings, or sometimes overt declarations, that the Trump administration will deputize the federal Department of Justice to go after states that have gone further than federal law. Are you concerned about that, that these things you are saying should be under state control won’t actually be under our control?

Toor: If you look at the history of developing these programs in Colorado, whether it be legislation, regulatory requirement, state investment, or state incentives for clean energy, they’ve all been very carefully crafted with a clear-eyed understanding of what the legal constraints are from federal law. And so I really don’t believe that the work we have done would be vulnerable to a legal attack by the administration or the Department of Justice. It’s interesting to me, if you go back in history and think about some of the really important steps that Colorado took on this journey, probably the first really big step was the adoption of the state renewable electricity portfolio standard that was challenged in federal court. There was a Commerce Clause argument made that this was unfair against state power suppliers. And the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the state in that case, the decision was written by a justice who happened to have the name Gorsuch. Who’s now on the Supreme Court. That illustrates the kind of care that’s been taken, that even very conservative courts have upheld state policy, because it is crafted with a clear understanding of what the Constitution and the law allow.

Sun: So Colorado should not be concerned that Xcel, or Tri-State, or other folks are going to start pitching new coal-fired power plants, or major new gas plants?

Toor: I certainly think there’s no new coal-fired power plants coming to the state. And I think we are continuing on the pathway of retiring expensive legacy coal generation and replacing it with lower-cost, cleaner energy. When it comes to natural gas generation, I would say that from a state perspective, our emissions targets are not technology-specific. We’re telling utilities, you need to meet an 80% reduction by 2030, but we’re not telling them which technologies they need to use to meet that. To date, what we’ve seen is that coal generation is largely being replaced by wind, solar and batteries, but that gas generation has had an important role to play in providing reliability and ensuring access. And in the modeling that we did looking out to 2040, while gas would likely continue to play an important role for reliability, as we put more and more wind and solar and batteries on the grid, then gas plays a less and less important role in actually producing energy. You need it there, because there are some hours of the year where you absolutely need it to keep the lights on, but it’s not used very much. Modeling predicted that even with some increase in gas capacity in the state, that by 2040 only 2 or 3% of that power would actually come from gas. Most hours of the year, it’s cheaper just to run your wind, and solar, and batteries.

Sun: Can you reassure people that we are comfortably still on that track for 80% reductions of emissions in that very big area of electrical generation, by 2030?

Toor: Yes. I am very confident that we are still on track for meeting our electric sectors 2030 targets. And I think there will be a vigorous conversation over the next year about what it looks like to move past 2030, and think about potential 2040 clean energy targets.",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WIND-ENERGY-KS-10052022157-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-29 10:20:02.424317

The meeting, which took place in Burns Flat, Oklahoma, marked a vital opportunity for direct engagement between federal regulators and the state’s farming and ranching community.

Secretary Arthur expressed deep appreciation for Administrator Mason’s willingness to come to Oklahoma and engage directly with the state’s producers. “We were really appreciative that the administrator made time to come to Oklahoma and sit down and talk to our ag producers,” Arthur stated, highlighting the rare opportunity for such a candid exchange.

The conversation, as summarized by Secretary Arthur, encompassed a wide range of opinions and concerns regarding EPA actions and opportunities for improvement. Key issues brought forth by producers included:

Water Regulations: A persistent and significant concern for the agricultural sector, water regulations continue to be a major focus.

Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF): Secretary Arthur noted the practical challenges faced by anyone driving a diesel pickup or tractor, with DEF issues posing a considerable burden for producers, even if the topic hasn’t “risen to the level of D.C.”

CAFO Regulations: The regulatory framework surrounding Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations also featured prominently in the discussions.

A clear message emerged from the producers: a desire to comply with regulations, provided they are “common sense.” Secretary Arthur emphasized this point, stating, “I think overall what we heard is that farmers and ranchers want to comply with the regulations, but they need to be common sense.” She believes that the presence of Administrator Mason and other Region 6 representatives in Oklahoma demonstrates a genuine willingness to listen and make necessary improvements.

Secretary Arthur underscored the profound importance of having Oklahomans like Scott Mason in key federal roles. Mason, a fifth-generation farmer and rancher from Cordell, brings invaluable firsthand experience to his position. “I think it’s a tremendous opportunity for Oklahoma,” Arthur remarked, pointing out that not only is Mason a regional administrator, but other Oklahomans also hold high-level positions within the USDA.

The presence of “common sense people who understand the function of government and certainly understand the function of regulatory agencies” is seen by Secretary Arthur as a unique advantage for Oklahoma. She believes these individuals, who “know what it’s like to be a farmer or rancher in the state of Oklahoma,” can help balance agricultural productivity with the nuances of regulatory oversight. “Having those voices to really listen to, and farmers are great at finding solutions. We have to do that every single day,” she asserted, highlighting the proactive nature of producers in finding solutions.

Secretary Arthur reflected on the historical challenges of dealing with the EPA under previous administrations, emphasizing why meetings like this are so crucial. “This meeting is incredibly important,” she stated, noting the unprecedented nature of an EPA administrator openly soliciting feedback from farmers and ranchers. “I don’t know that anyone at EPA in the past would’ve been brave enough to sit down in an open forum with farmers and ranchers and ask, ‘Hey, what’s on your mind? What can we help fix? What can we make better?”

The fact that both the EPA Administrator and the Regional Administrator were in Oklahoma within the first hundred days of the administration is, according to Secretary Arthur and seasoned agency staff, virtually unheard of. This willingness to leave the confines of offices in D.C. or Dallas and engage directly with those making a living in agriculture signals a genuine commitment to improvement from the current administration.

Looking ahead, Secretary Arthur outlined the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture’s plans for the summer. With the legislative session wrapping up, she expressed gratitude to the Oklahoma State Legislature and Governor Stitt for their strong support of the agriculture industry. The ODA will be busy reviewing applications for the Ag Youth Council and will focus on extensive outreach across the state. This includes “Ag in the Classroom” tours for teachers and continued engagement from the market development team, all aimed at supporting Oklahoma’s diverse agricultural sector.",,N,,2025-05-29 11:07:29.817375

According to E2’s latest analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, in April alone companies cancelled $4.5bn in investments in new battery, electric vehicle and wind projects in advance of the US House’s passage of a “massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits”.

An additional $1.5bn in newly found cancelled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.

As the Senate prepares to take up the legislation, E2’s analysis shows that more than 10,000 announced jobs have already been cancelled amid concerns over the advance of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Michael Timberlake, ES communications director, said: “Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancellations.

More than $12bn and over 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far, according to the analysis.

Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced — along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments — are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

While cancellations continue to rise, companies continue to invest in the potential of America’s clean economy.

Businesses in April announced nearly $500m in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states, including a $400m investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3m investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina.

Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3000 new permanent jobs if completed.

April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico.

Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers.

These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates.

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized.

California could accelerate the deployment of clean energy and save billions of dollars by adding more generation and storage at underutilized interconnections for existing power plants, according to a working paper by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission opened the door for new sources to use surplus interconnection with Order 845 in 2018.

Several experts said the research was promising, but the California Independent System Operator said the report likely “significantly overstates” commercial interest and feasibility.

Dive Insight:

Like many states, California is facing a congested interconnection queue, costly transmission upgrades and rising retail electricity rates.

The Berkeley paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, claims to have analyzed hundreds of existing renewable and thermal plants in California and identified potential for 53 GW of additional clean energy capacity, including wind and solar, as well as 23GW of storage, through surplus interconnection. In total, it says that adding 76 GW of clean energy capacity could nearly double the state’s installed generation capacity, which was 89 GW in 2024, according to the California Energy Commission.

The report was published earlier this month along with an interactive map of surplus interconnection.

The paper concludes that, in general, both renewable and fossil fuel generators underutilize their interconnections, but this is especially true of gas-powered peaker plants. Overall, the paper says about 16 GW of fossil fuel capacity is operating only 15% of the time or less.

“So for 85% of the time, the connection where that gas plant is sending electricity to the grid is essentially idle,” said Umed Paliwal, one of the report’s authors and a senior scientist at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy. “What if you could add solar and wind near these underutilized interconnections? … This is a very fast way to bring capacity online.”

In an emailed response to questions, a spokesperson for CAISO said the grid operator currently has 230 GW of resources in its interconnection queue, and has “awarded deliverability” to about 60 GW. They said a surplus interconnection service pathway is already available under the ISO tariff, however, “we have not seen significant interest in this approach from developers.”

Michael Davidson, an assistant professor at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy and the Jacobs School of Engineering, called the report “interesting,” but added that he would like to see more details of its methodology.

“I believe the authors propose a creative solution to partially addressing the interconnection bottleneck,” he wrote in an email.

However, he continued, one cannot make a straightforward comparison between gas plants and renewables in terms of levelized costs.

“If a gas peaker plant is only operating 1% of the year, it is because those are the hours in which prices are high enough to justify operation,” Davidson said. “In addition to capacity factor utilization, future analyses should examine how much the existing thermal plants are utilizing the interconnection during peak periods, and therefore how much additional supply can be put on the grid when it is needed most.”

Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford, wrote in an email that the paper’s results are “credible in principle, although it is hard to confirm the exact numbers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Icfacoo9roF6QU9aj5Xh_XhPIHkILqBn6Q3p5W3uhZ8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMDY0ODg0NjAzX0ZZNUd1NzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-29 13:20:13.939987

By intentionally boosting oil and gas production and stymying carbon-free energy, federal officials are violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty, alleges the lawsuit, filed on Thursday.
They also led agencies to stymy renewable energy production and to suppress climate research and data, flaunting congressional environmental protections, the lawsuit argues.
In the wake of her 2023 win in the Montana lawsuit, she said it felt like taking “one step forward, three steps back”.
The youth plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the three executive orders unconstitutional and block their implementation.","Twenty two young Americans have filed a new lawsuit against the Trump administration over its anti-environment executive orders. By intentionally boosting oil and gas production and stymying carbon-free energy, federal officials are violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty, alleges the lawsuit, filed on Thursday.

The federal government is engaging in unlawful executive overreach by breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health, argue the plaintiffs, who are between the ages of seven and 25 and hail from the heavily climate-impacted states of Montana, Hawaii, Oregon, California and Florida. They also say officials’ emissions-increasing and science-suppressing orders have violated the state-created danger doctrine, a legal principle meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens.

“At its core, this suit is about the health of children, it’s about the right to life, it’s about the right to form families,” said Julia Olson, attorney and founder of Our Children’s Trust, the non-profit law firm that brought the suit. “We all have constitutional rights, and if we don’t use our constitution – if we walk away from it and we walk away from our youth – we will not have a democracy.”

The lawsuit specifically targets three of the slew of pro-fossil fuel executive orders Trump has signed during his second term. Among them are two day-one Trump moves to declare a “national energy emergency” and “unleash American energy”, and another April order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel.

All three orders aimed to bolster already-booming US energy production. They also led agencies to stymy renewable energy production and to suppress climate research and data, flaunting congressional environmental protections, the lawsuit argues.

The litigation is the latest in a series of youth-led climate cases brought by the non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust. The lead plaintiff in the new case, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, was also a plaintiff in the firm’s Held v Montana lawsuit, which notched a landmark win in 2023 when a judge ruled that the state’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated their rights under the state’s constitution.

“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” said Lighthiser.

Lighthiser has already seen the impacts of the climate crisis in her life. Flood-related destruction to roads and bridges one summer even forced her family to sell their house in Livingston.

“The effects of climate change cause Eva persistent stress and anxiety about her future,” the lawsuit says. “Every additional ton of [greenhouse gas] pollution and increment of heat Defendants cause will cause Eva more harm.”

Other plaintiffs in the new case previously participated in other Our Children’s Trust lawsuits, including one which reached a historic settlement in Hawaii last year; another filed by California youth against the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and a third, the federal case Juliana v US, which was filed a decade ago and dismissed Juliana without prejudice last year.

Lighthiser said Trump’s re-election last year felt “like such a heavy thing”. In the wake of her 2023 win in the Montana lawsuit, she said it felt like taking “one step forward, three steps back”.

She fears Trump’s policies will directly impact her well-being. In moves to prop up the dying coal industry in recent months, for instance, the administration has granted relief to both the Spring Creek coal mine and Colstrip coal-fired power station in Montana; trains transporting coal from one to the other run through Lighthiser’s hometown.

“The coal cars are brimming with coal that just blows [dust] out all over my town,” said Lighthiser. “That could effect my own body and my own health, and it feels very intimidating, because it’s not something that feels like it’s in my control right now.”

The lawsuit names Trump and the US as defendants, as well as the office of management and budget, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the departments of interior, energy and transportation, in addition to the head of each agency.

“These are agencies that are really deeply involved in making sure that more fossil fuels stay online,” said Olson.

It also targets scientific organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and its parent agency the Department of Commerce, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration – agencies that are “suppressing science” in their attempts to comply with Trump’s executive orders, said Olson.

The youth plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the three executive orders unconstitutional and block their implementation. They are also demanding that it protect the rights to a clean environment granted by certain state constitutions like Montana and Hawaii, which they say the Trump directives have impinged upon.

In Olson’s view, the case is winnable, particularly because it only brings claims under rights that are explicitly granted under the US constitution, and which have already been recognized by the supreme court. (Juliana v US, by contrast, argued that Americans have an implicit, but unstated, constitutional right to a life-sustaining climate system.)

But no matter how the case is eventually ruled, Olson said, the filing of the lawsuit is “itself a success”.

“Having young people rise up at a time when democracy is threatened and when there’s retaliation against so many people in this country for standing up against the administration, that is success,” she said. “It’s about having the bravery to bring claims in the court, of not being too afraid to use their rights.”

Though it is “scary to take on the man in the highest position of power”, Lighthiser said the lawsuit is “absolutely necessary”.

She hopes it will eventually help slow global warming, which has led to more frequent and intense wildfires, droughts and floods in her home state of Montana. And she hopes it will afford youth the ability to “just be kids”.

She recalled one day during the summer of 2022, when the Yellowstone River flooded her hometown. “I spent seven hours that day filling sandbags for people to take to their homes,” she said.

“That kind of thing is going to become more common [with] climate change,” she said. “That doesn’t sound to me like we’re getting to live freely.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64138247e91fde67087b21938ff45d5734b3c944/293_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe62902ffa77668dc1a1f0fb51ef89d1,N,,2025-05-29 10:21:16.644911

News item from PV Hardware","PV Hardware USA (PVH), a global solar tracking and foundation solutions provide, claims to have the capacity to immediately Safe Harbor 5 GW of tracker product, offering solar developers an opportunity to preserve eligibility for current clean energy tax credits amid legislative uncertainty.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of business development for PVH USA. “We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics.”

Under current IRS regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of its total cost has been spent before any new legislative changes take effect — including through tracker purchases.

“PVH’s scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,” Bitar said. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country’s largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

The first-term Democrat took advantage Wednesday of the annual Emerging Issues Forum at N.C. State University in Raleigh to champion the state’s energy sector.

“North Carolina is a leader in the clean energy economy, and we are home to more than 20,000 clean energy jobs and $24 billion in clean energy investments,” Stein said. “Our state is well-positioned to continue that success, and I urge Congress to protect the clean energy investments that have contributed to our state’s prosperity.”

The Tax Foundation, a leading nonpartisan nonprofit with mission to examine tax policies leading to greater economic growth, says the tax breaks of the Inflation Reduction Act have proven more expensive than originally forecast. U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., speaker of the House of Representatives, says the reform is “somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.”

Transcribed, it’s elimination of policies not working and tweaks to those that do work, the Tax Foundation says.

Greenville is the latest new home for the clean energy industry. Boviet Solar celebrated a grand opening of the first phase of its factory there in April enabling annual photovoltaic module output capacity of 2 gigawatts. The second phase is expected to be in operation next year.

The facility is valued at $294 million. State and local incentives over a dozen years are $34.6 million for the Vietnamese solar company. The projection is for the entire project to yield 900 new jobs.

Stein said repeal of the Biden administration act would also cost “billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.” His office says families in the state would likely have an annual increase of $200 to their electricity costs.

They’ve asked the court to rule against the three asset managers’ motion to dismiss.
The federal government claims that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street used their “ESG agenda” to hide their greed and reap profits illegally.
“State Street Global Advisors acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the email said.
The tension here, as asset managers are quick to point out, is that ESG investing is very popular.","The Trump administration is throwing its weight behind a lawsuit accusing three of the world’s largest asset managers of conspiring to drive down the price of coal. While the suit is rooted firmly in the world of public equities, it underscores clearly the White House’s position on sustainability.

In a 22 May joint statement of interest filed in federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice say that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street illegally “co-ordinated use of the power of horizontal shareholdings to distort output and prices in energy markets”. They’ve asked the court to rule against the three asset managers’ motion to dismiss.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 11 other red state attorneys general filed an antitrust suit in December. It claims that the trio’s use of proxy advisers amounts to anticompetitive behaviour that drive up Americans’ heating and energy bills. The Trump administration’s petition puts the full faith and credit of the US government behind those claims.

“This case is not about ordinary activity by asset managers such as passive index investing or even procompetitive activism,” the FTC/DOJ statement claims. “As alleged, the holders of large quantities of stock in competing companies agreed to use those shareholdings to reduce the output of US coal to increase profits at the expense of American consumers and businesses. This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws.”

The real target: ESG

The FTC/DOJ statement is the latest and boldest assault on “woke” investing. The federal government claims that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street used their “ESG agenda” to hide their greed and reap profits illegally.

“The complaint alleges that each defendant publicly committed to use their common shareholdings in the coal companies to reduce carbon emissions by joining the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which required members to pursue ‘decarbonisation goals’ to reach net zero emissions by 2050 for all assets under their management,” the FTC and DOJ lawyers claim in the 34-page statement.

“Plaintiffs allege that pursuant to this initiative, each Defendant took concrete steps to engage with the management of competing coal companies to obtain their commitment to limit carbon emissions by restricting the production of coal within the United States.”

The statement also accuses BlackRock and State Street of collusion through Climate Action 100+, “an unprecedented global investor engagement initiative” that federal lawyers say is “committed to influencing corporate policies and actions, including compliance with specific coal output reduction goals”.

All three defendants have dropped out of Net Zero and BlackRock and State Street have walked away from Climate Action 100+ because of the pressure from Trump’s Washington. The red state attorneys general argue that the threat is latent and enduring.

Frontal assault: Proxy advisers

The statement is also an assault on proxy advisers, who are an age-old target of the Republican right. “A plaintiff can satisfy its initial burden with a showing that horizontal shareholdings purchased solely for investment were in fact used to cause a substantial lessening of competition in one or more relevant markets,” the FTC and DOJ lawyers claim.

They say the “statutory text” of US law “establishes liability when the effect of… the use of such stock by voting or granting of proxies or otherwise, may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly”.

A few weeks before the Trump administration weighed into the BlackRock suit, Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee held hearings on what they call the proxy adviser “cartel.”

There have long been tensions between public companies’ C-suites and their investors over governance. Proxy advisers have been a useful foil for those who back the C-suite, in part because the proxy adviser market is dominated by two firms. Republicans claim that ISS and Glass, Lewis take up 97 percent of the proxy adviser market.

Costs go up

All three firms have vowed to fight the suit.

“Though we have concerns with many of the legal interpretations promoted by the agencies,” Vanguard said in a statement. “Vanguard appreciates their explicit acknowledgement that the antitrust laws allow these three things: ‘passive fund investing’, ‘shareholder advocacy for better corporate governance’ and ‘active investing that doesn’t harm competition’. The facts show Vanguard has stayed well within this construct.”

“The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock’s statement said. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.”

In an email statement, a State Street spokesman said “we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process. Additional filings do not change our assessment”.

“State Street Global Advisors acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the email said. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies.”

At a minimum, though, the Trump administration filing is a warning to less well-heeled firms: ESG investment could be a lot more expensive.

The tension here, as asset managers are quick to point out, is that ESG investing is very popular. A recent analysis by Grand View Research estimates the global market for ESG investments reached more than $25 trillion in 2023. Grand View estimates the asset class will grow by nearly 19 percent per year through this decade.",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/05/Coal-NPM.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 13:22:36.229967

The Presidio Municipal Development District (PMDD) of Presidio County, Texas and Exceed Geo Energy have signed a 110-MW geothermal power purchase agreement, in what is described as a transformative development opportunity for the region. The agreement was formalized during the inaugural “Presidio Vision 2035” student competition.

The PPA is exceptionally beneficial for Presidio as it will deliver substantially greater electricity capacity than current local demand. This means that the future power infrastructure will be vital in attracting major industrial development to the strategic border location.

The stability that geothermal offers is particularly significant for Presidio, which currently sits at the end of the line on the ERCOT grid and has experienced prolonged outages. The geothermal facility could also potentially serve as a blackstart resource capable of helping restore power to the broader Texas grid during major outages.

“This 110-megawatt commitment represents far more than meeting our current energy needs,” said John T. Kennedy, PMDD Executive Director. “We’re creating the foundation for transformative economic growth: the kind of reliable, clean power that can support data centers, refrigerated logistics, expanded manufacturing, and value-added processing facilities that take advantage of our unique position in the North American trade corridor.”

The agreement builds on last year’s resource assessment funded by PMDD and conducted by the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, which provided crucial technical validation for the region’s geothermal potential. This comprehensive approach positions Presidio to become the first active geothermal project of this scale and type.

Tim Tarver, CEO of Exceed Geo Energy, brings decades of experience in the energy industry. “Growing up in a town even smaller than Presidio, I understand both the challenges and the incredible potential that exists in communities like this,” Tarver said. He went on to explain that the project represents more than energy development, focusing instead on building real economic opportunity that allows people to thrive in their home communities.

Exceed Geo Energy is also working on a 5-MW geothermal pilot project in Austin, Texas in partnership with local utility Austin Energy.

Project timeline

The power purchase agreement will establish comprehensive terms for energy delivery, with commercial operations expected to begin by late 2026. The initial phase will bring 9.9 MW online, followed by expansion to the full 110-megawatt capacity.

PMDD Board President Alonso Hernandez noted that the timing of the agreement framework during the student competition perfectly captured the community’s commitment to both honoring its future generations and building the infrastructure necessary for long-term prosperity.

The geothermal development represents strategic planning that recognizes Presidio’s unique advantages: a critical position in international trade flows, proximity to major metropolitan markets, and access to world-class geothermal resources. The 110-MW capacity provides the kind of industrial-scale power generation that can transform regional economics by supporting data centers, manufacturing plants, and agricultural processing facilities simultaneously.

Inside Clean Energy is ICN’s weekly bulletin of news and analysis about the energy transition.","The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where U.S. tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The U.S. renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the U.S. economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of U.S. products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the U.S. government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

DAN GEARINO: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

CHRIS SEIPLE: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of U.S. utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

GEARINO: With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the U.S. How would you characterize where that stands?

GEARINO: Is there any U.S. energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

SEIPLE: I don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

GEARINO: One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the U.S. may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?

SEIPLE: Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the U.S. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the U.S.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the U.S. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the U.S. So the U.S. is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any U.S. company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for U.S. companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the U.S. of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

GEARINO: These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

SEIPLE: I think that’s the central challenge for the industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate end game is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

For the First Time, China Invests More in Wind and Solar Than Coal Overseas: China’s state-backed Belt and Road Initiative of investments in other countries has now shifted to favor renewable energy over fossil fuels, as Katie Surma, Georgina Gustin and Nicholas Kusnetz report for ICN. The initiative had a history of supporting development of coal-fired power plants, with ripple effects on climate change and geopolitics. But a new analysis shows that more than two-thirds of China’s investment in overseas power in 2022 and 2023 were in wind and solar.

Trump’s Nuclear Orders Face Some Self-Inflicted Challenges: President Donald Trump last week signed four executive orders to accelerate construction of new nuclear power plants, making various changes to help build new reactors and alter governance of the previously independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Alexander C. Kaufman writes for Latitude Media about how Trump’s nuclear goals are running into obstacles set by his administration, such as cuts to the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy and the firing of most of the staff at the Loan Programs Office.

A New Charge for EV Owners Is Tucked Into Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’: The massive budget reconciliation bill that passed the House last week contains a provision that would impose a new annual registration fee of $250 for EVs and $100 for hybrid vehicles, as Lee Hedgepeth and Marianne Lavelle report for ICN. Experts say the charge could discourage purchases of the vehicles. The idea isn’t new as a number of states have passed similar fees that officials have said are designed to make up for the loss of gasoline tax revenue.

Tesla Sales Continue to Sink in Europe: Tesla’s European business is “collapsing,” according to Mack Hogan of InsideEVs.com, writing about sales through the first third of this year. Overall sales of EVs grew by 27.4 percent from January to April compared to the prior-year period, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. But Tesla’s sales were down 49 percent. There are many reasons, including heightened competition from other brands and the blowback from Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration and support for far-right causes.

Governor Stein is committed to supporting and developing North Carolina’s growing clean energy sector. Last month, the Governor joined Boviet Solar at the grand opening of its new solar module manufacturing facility in Greenville, which has already created nearly 400 jobs with more on the way. As part of his second recovery budget announcement last week, Governor Stein proposed $239 million to strengthen critical infrastructure in western North Carolina, including investing in projects to safeguard against future disasters.

Congress’ proposed repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act could cost North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits. Repealing the credits could also raise electricity costs for North Carolina families by $200 per year. Governor Stein is urging North Carolina’s congressional delegation to lower costs for North Carolina families by preserving the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits.

South Carolina Circuit Court Judge William Young is scheduled to hear arguments Thursday and Friday on the oil companies’ motion to dismiss the Charleston lawsuit.","(The Center Square) – A South Carolina judge is scheduled to hear arguments Thursday and Friday on whether to dismiss a climate-change lawsuit by the city of Charleston against 24 oil and gas companies.

In the lawsuit filed in 2020, the city said the companies contributed to greenhouse gas pollution, global warming, and climate change by selling fossil fuel products.

“As this lawsuit shows, these companies have known for more than 50 years that their products were going to cause the worst flooding the world has seen since Noah built the Ark,” then mayor John Tecklenburg said in a statement when the lawsuit was filed. “And instead of warning us, they covered up the truth and turned our flooding problems into their profits. That was wrong, and this lawsuit is all about holding them accountable for that multi-decade campaign of deception.”

The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages.

Charleston’s lawsuit is one of 20 filed nationwide by state and local governments against oil companies, according to federal court records.

Two of the defendants in the Charleston case, Chevron Corp. and Chevron U.S.A. Inc., tried to have the case tried in federal court. But U.S. District Court Judge Richard Mark Gergel in 2023 moved it back to state court.

On April 8, President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. attorney general to take action to stop state climate change lawsuits against oil companies.

“These state laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate Americans by driving up energy costs for families coast-to-coast, despite some of these families not living or voting in states with these crippling policies,” the executive order states. “These laws and policies also undermine federalism by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few states into all states. Americans must be permitted to heat their homes, fuel their cars, and have peace of mind – free from policies that make energy more expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life.”

The Center Square was unsuccessful before publication getting comment from Charleston Mayor William Cogswell.

South Carolina Circuit Court Judge William Young is scheduled to hear arguments Thursday and Friday on the oil companies’ motion to dismiss the Charleston lawsuit.

Regardless of the ruling in the South Carolina case and Trump’s executive order, these types of lawsuits aren’t likely to go away anytime soon, Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told The Center Square.

“I think the trajectory of the climate lawsuits is probably going to increase,” Isacc said. “As long as we have leftist elected municipalities in states who recognize there is a law firm out there that will do this for them for free, I think you are going to continue to have people take the hook.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/e1/2e1b0778-53ba-4ab4-94d9-4fcba5017763/68377a8a3c57d.image.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 09:13:56.552185

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

The automaker said it will not raise prices on its American portfolio.

That's ""despite the increased cost of doing business in the current environment.""

Volkswagen will not raise the price of the electric cars it sells in the United States until the end of June, the automaker said in a statement Wednesday. The company added that it wants to keep its cars affordable for customers, so it will cover the increased costs brought on by new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on the auto industry.

“Volkswagen of America, Inc. is pleased to announce that despite the increased cost of doing business in the current environment, it will continue to hold vehicle pricing at current MSRPs through the month of June,” the company said.

The ID.4 is Volkswagen's best-selling EV in America.

As a result, the MSRPs of the American-made ID.4 crossover, as well as the German-made ID. Buzz minivan will remain unchanged. Furthermore, the gas-powered Atlas, Atlas Cross Sport, Jetta, Taos, Golf GTI, Golf R, and Tiguan will also be protected for now.

In other words, if you were thinking about buying a new ID.4 or ID. Buzz, this might be the best time to do so. Neither of the EVs is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit when purchasing, but they may qualify for the incentive when leasing, so keep that in mind. However, time is of the essence, as the federal tax credit might soon become a thing of the past because of a recent bill passed by the U.S. Senate that moves to end the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for clean energy, including EV tax credits.

The 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 starts from $46,520 (including shipping) for the base rear-wheel drive Pro version with 282 horsepower and an EPA estimated driving range of 291 miles. This, along with the $52,075 Pro S trim, is the longest-range ID.4 on offer. Several all-wheel drive models are also available. They offer 263 miles of range and cost between $50,420 and $58,720.

Meanwhile, the 2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz is priced between $61,545 and $71,545 in the U.S. Its EPA-rated range is between 231 and 234 miles, depending on the powertrain configuration.

Earlier this month, General Motors took a similar approach to its pricing strategy. Despite it building the increasingly successful Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Cadillac Optiq in Mexico–meaning they would be more affected by the import tariff compared to American-made models–the automaker said it will hold prices steady throughout the year.

Toyota, Honda and Hyundai also said they would bear the brunt of the tariffs, at least until the end of this month.

The danger that the Trump administration expands the American sanctions regime implemented via the global dollar invoicing system and export controls remains undiminished.","The United States is now staring down the barrel of what amounts to a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits and loan authorities. Not even the House Republicans who vocally defended the law, in the end, voted against President Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” To be sure, there’s no final outcome yet — leading Republican senators don’t seem satisfied with the bill headed their way, and energy sector lobbyists are ready to push harder. But the fact that House Republicans were willing to walk away from billions of dollars of public spending for their districts and perhaps $1 trillion worth of economic growth is a flashing red sign that Trump’s politics have capsized the once-watertight argument that the IRA would be too important to American businesses and communities to be destroyed.

The Biden Administration touted the IRA as the United States’ marquee investment not just in reducing emissions and promoting economic development, but also in bringing back American manufacturing to compete against China in the market for advanced technologies. The Trump administration takes this apparent conflict with China seriously ― the threat of economic decoupling looms large ― but seems to have no desire to compete the way the Biden administration did. Rather than commit to the solar, wind, battery, grid, and electric vehicle investments that are laying the foundation for a manufacturing revival, the Trump administration has doubled down on the conjoined ideas that America should be self-sufficient and should play to its strengths: critical minerals, nuclear, natural gas, and even coal. Never mind that Trump’s tariff policy and his party’s deep cuts to energy-related spending will stop these plans, too, in their tracks. “Energy dominance” has always been a smokescreen ― of fossil fuels, by fossil fuels, for fossil fuels.

While Republicans attempt to shut down America’s entire scientific research apparatus, the rest of the world moves on. The demise of the Inflation Reduction Act would decisively surrender the global market for all types of commercialized clean energy sources (and nuclear energy, too) to Chinese companies. Chinese companies already dominate the input sectors for these technologies, whether it’s processing and refining mineral products such as polysilicon, gallium, and graphite, or producing infrastructure commodities such as steel and aluminum. The end of Biden’s climate and infrastructure laws will also leave the American car industry in the dust, as the rest of the world shifts gears toward purchasing more efficient and cheaper electric vehicles ― particularly Chinese brands such as BYD. (Ford’s CEO drives a Xiaomi electric vehicle and “doesn’t want to give it up.”) Consider it a sign of the times that Ethiopia recently banned the import of gas-powered vehicles. Electrification is in, combustion is burnt out.

It’s not just China that benefits. In November, the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins estimated that the repeal of the IRA leaves up to $80 billion in clean technology manufacturing investment opportunities for other countries to seize between now and 2032, the law’s intended sunset year. Those countries aren’t just the likely (read: wealthier) suspects such as Japan, South Korea, or the European Union. The abdication of U.S. leadership would also boost electric vehicle and battery manufacturing capacity in Morocco, Mexico, India, Indonesia, and elsewhere across Southeast Asia; solar power-related manufacturing further across Southeast Asia; and wind power-related manufacturing in Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, and Canada.

These countries won’t just benefit from investors looking to build outside the United States. A Trump-induced fall in American imports of these technologies and their inputs may also drive some degree of global disinflation, insofar as these countries can secure input goods no longer flowing into the American market at cheaper prices. The writing has been on the wall since the early Biden administration that failing to invest meant investing in failure. This is what the Trump administration is poised to do, to the detriment of American technological capabilities and standards of living.

Financial dominance

Just because the United States might be dropping out of the race for global decarbonization, however, does not mean that the rest of the world can choose to ignore the United States in return. The Trump administration can still play spoiler with every other country’s efforts to decarbonize ― even China’s ― for one overarching reason: the mighty dollar. The United States may be hemorrhaging the political capital that coordinating the energy transition requires, but it still controls the currency of decarbonization itself.

It’s hard to overstate how central the management of the U.S. dollar is to the management of global decarbonization. Let’s sketch out some of the key dynamics. First, the dollar is the world’s primary trade currency. Because most global trade is denominated and invoiced in dollars, fluctuations in the value of the dollar relative to the value of other currencies will affect the price of importing both essential commodities and capital goods in other countries. Any volatility in the prices of oil, critical minerals, food, or machinery ― including the inputs to energy systems ― is most likely measured in a currency that every other country needs to earn through trade or borrow from investors. Efforts to denominate commodity trade in other currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi, are not likely to scale up rapidly, however, thanks to the network effect of the dollar system: Market actors will only ditch the dollar if most of their counterparties do.

Second, then, the dollar is the world’s dominating financial currency. Countries seeking foreign investment must issue debt at rates and on terms that foreign investors, many of whom measure their returns in dollars, judge as safe relative to the returns on U.S. Treasury bonds, conventionally the world’s premier “safe asset.” How the U.S. Federal Reserve moves interest rates influences how every other central bank does; higher rates in the U.S. usually push up Treasury bond yields and, as other central banks also raise rates or stockpile dollars, make borrowing for investment and for refinancing debt more expensive across the whole world ― particularly for large-scale energy and adaptation infrastructure projects. The U.S. Federal Reserve also manages the dollar swap lines and repurchase (or “repo”) facilities that provide dollar liquidity to the rest of the world during a financial crisis, as in the Great Recession and the subsequent Eurozone financial crisis, or a sudden dollar cash shortage, as in 2019.

Finally, the United States maintains a comprehensive sanctions regime that operates through cross-border dollar payments systems and “clearing-house” facilities such as SWIFT, which processes interbank payments, and CHIPS, which handles over 90% of all dollar-denominated transactions globally. When the United States wants to cut target companies and whole countries out of the dollar financial system, it prevents SWIFT from processing targeted entities’ cross-border transactions and U.S.-based financial institutions from accepting them.

The Obama administration and first Trump administration used U.S. control over SWIFT and CHIPS to administer sanctions against Iran, and the Biden administration did the same to Russia. The U.S. Departments of Treasury and Commerce also administer what’s known as a “secondary sanctions” regime that imposes these financial penalties on unrelated third-parties that violate initial sanctions. And the Department of Commerce enforces export controls that restrict technology transfer to foreign targets. The Biden administration combined these authorities to limit the ability of both U.S. and foreign companies to export certain technologies to targeted Chinese companies.

Perhaps ironically, some of these dynamics don’t bite the way they used to during the Biden administration, when the dollar was expensive relative to other currencies. Trump’s inflationary and growth-destroying budget, trigger-happy tariffs, and neglect of the fracking sector have driven a sharp depreciation in the dollar and destabilized the market for U.S. Treasury debt. Some cuts to U.S. interest rates are likely given the elevated probability of a recession. All of these factors ― undeniably a bad look for the United States ― should support emerging market financial conditions by lowering the cost of commodity imports, raising the attractiveness of sovereign debt to foreign investors, and help stave off potential debt crises.

But easier global financial conditions in the short term do not diminish the threat the Trump administration continues to pose to global economic stability. The danger that the Trump administration expands the American sanctions regime implemented via the global dollar invoicing system and export controls remains undiminished. What’s more, the tension between the president and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should alert foreign central banks that their access to the American dollar liquidity facilities is ultimately contingent on the Federal Reserve’s independence from Trump’s influence. During the first Trump administration, the European Union and China alike started strategizing how to derisk their dependence on the dollar; U.S. policymakers should not be surprised if those governments are now dusting off those playbooks.

The motor and the fuels

The dollar’s dominance is in part an effect of the gargantuan size of the U.S. consumer market. Trump’s tariff threats had governments across the world scrambling to cut deals with the United States to preserve their market access ― including by promising to purchase U.S. natural gas.

The view outside the U.S. seems to be that there is no easy replacement for the U.S. consumer. As the Australian Strategic Policy Institute put it, “US household spending in 2023 reached $19 trillion, double the level of the European Union and almost three times that of China. … there are no obvious markets to replace [U.S. consumers].” Indian journalist M. Rajshekhar notes that China, too, needs external markets to absorb its products, and that it cannot count on other Global South countries to let Chinese goods flood their markets. Americans are the motor that keeps the global economy spinning.

The inability to sell goods to the United States is a threat to decarbonization abroad not just because it gives Trump an avenue to hawk natural gas, but also because U.S. consumer spending provides the world with a source of the dollars with which decarbonization is financed in the first place. And to the extent that the IRA would have supported U.S. consumer demand for clean energy technologies and electric vehicles, its de facto repeal ― while a source of potential disinflation for Global South producers ― snuffs out a key demand signal for the production of inputs to those sectors across the Global South.

Where the Global South’s clean energy transition is concerned, natural gas unfortunately remains an important alternative to coal in the absence of widespread renewable energy deployment. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas, the use of which has doubled since 2009 as global demand for the fuel rose sharply. Countries across Europe and Asia depend on U.S. gas for domestic power and industrial uses ― particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Large energy importing countries like India increasingly rely on gas to meet energy demand spikes. Over the longer term, industry leaders expect LNG demand to rise 60% by 2040, particularly on the back of persistent Asian demand. Although planned U.S. LNG export capacity is already on track to double between now and 2028, the Trump administration is supporting the buildout of even more capacity to meet this expected global demand.

Becoming dependent on “molecules of U.S. freedom” for industrial growth and for transitioning off of coal may once have seemed like a smart decision across emerging markets, particularly when prices were lower. But it has now left dependent Global South countries uniquely vulnerable to energy import price and power market shocks caused by erratic U.S. policy and volatile (dollar-denominated) natural gas prices. Will the gas-dependent countries in Europe and Asia be able to access enough Chinese imports, invest sufficiently in local clean technology, and kick their LNG fix in time to meet their emissions reduction goals? Europe might; for the rest, this question is one worth following over the coming years.

The truth is that the United States has always had a unique opportunity to weaponize these aspects of dollar dominance in the interest of playing global spoilsport. As Chen Chris Gong, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, argues in her forthcoming (not yet peer-reviewed) paper on “The geoeconomics of transitioning to the post-fossil world,” Global South countries have an urgent reason to decarbonize built into their politics, whether their governments recognize it or not. So long as much of the Global South is dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy, “local people’s livelihood and firms’ survival are made vulnerable to compound cycles of dollar capital flow and cycles of basic commodity trade.” If the Global South cannot fully avoid the United States, their governments can at least sidestep it. Countries powered by clean energy, importing less fuel, and generating their own power are far more insulated from the dollar cycle and the dollar system, simple as that.

In contrast, as Gong highlights, the only incentives for the United States to pursue decarbonization come from the pressure of competing with China ― a competition that Republicans, for all their bluster, may not actually want to win ― or the pressure of mass consumer demand for a clean economy ― for which Democrats are not exactly fighting tooth and nail ― and the profits both promise. It’s darkly funny that the Inflation Reduction Act’s defenders are seizing on these exact reasons in their attempts to protect the law in the Senate when neither sufficiently moved House Republicans to reconsider.

For posterity, then, we should add another reason, even if it won’t convince Republicans to change tack: The looming repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act portends a future where Trump and his Republican party happily use their control over the global economy to drag the rest of the world down with the United States. “Energy dominance” may always have been formless bluster, but the United States’ financial dominance remains sharp enough to cut ― if not global emissions, then global standards of living.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMxMTkwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MzE2NDgyNH0.krBqsB21IVWCSguUZ-rCP3D4V6P6uIu0wHk9FuFCXPs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-29 09:11:37.329694

The agreement, which followed a 44-day strike last fall, allows Stellantis-leased employees at StarPlus to organize through a card check system. The union said 420 workers at the Kokomo facility are now officially represented by the UAW.

“UAW members at StarPlus stood up to make sure battery jobs are good union jobs,” said Dave Green, UAW Region 2B director. “Workers in Indiana and across the region know they deserve fair wages, workplace protections, and the dignity that UAW members have been fighting for the last 90 years.”

Stellantis confirmed the process in a statement Tuesday, saying the union had been recognized as “the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative.”

The development marks a win for the UAW’s efforts to unionize EV battery facilities. The union has already organized workers at Ultium Cells LLC, General Motors’ joint venture with LG Energy Solution, using a similar process at plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee.

The outcome in Indiana stands in contrast to Ford Motor Co.’s battery joint venture, BlueOval SK, in Kentucky, where the UAW has accused the company of stalling a union vote and intimidating workers despite majority interest.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week's House bill effectively renders moot many of the law's incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

""The House's plan coupled with the administration's focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,"" E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president's desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner's closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies' plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

""If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I'm not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,"" said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county's position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden's environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats' ""green new scam"" — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led ""American energy dominance"" agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent ""carbon leakage,"" or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi's energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

“This report from the Fraser of Allander Institute offers an important snapshot of the economic value our members are creating as we move toward a future powered by clean, home-grown renewable energy. It reflects what we know about the activity in the industry through the development, construction and operation of major projects such as the Moray East offshore and Viking onshore windfarms.

“We know that the energy crisis, marked by sharp rises in wholesale costs, has had wide-reaching effects on industry and households. And while it became clear that accelerating the deployment of clean energy projects is the only way to reduce our exposure to the volatility of international gas prices, it also brought serious challenges with supply chain disruptions and rising input costs making projects more expensive to deliver.

“Our industry is working closely with government to tackle these challenges in order to build more projects and build our future jobs. Scotland is set to play a key role in achieving the UK’s clean power goal for 2030 meaning that Scotland’s renewable energy industry will continue to drive growth and employment across the Scottish and UK economy.

“We urge the UK and Scottish governments to enable more robust data collection so we can continue to track performance of the renewable energy industry and our contribution to growth across the UK.”

Scottish Renewables and the Fraser of Allander Institute have published two previous editions of this report on the economic impact of renewable energy in Scotland.

In 2022, the global energy crisis accelerated demand for renewable energy while industry also faced significant challenges, including supply chain disruptions and rising input costs, which made projects more expensive to deliver. Whilst this has boosted turnover and output across the industry, rising operational and material costs have meant constrained growth in gross value added (GVA) and the creation of full-time jobs.

Professor Mairi Spowage, Director of Fraser of Allander Institute, said

“We have seen a significant shift in economic activity associated with the renewable energy industry in 2022, as more capacity comes online and moves from construction to generation. These shifts change the nature of the supply chains supported, which is likely to continue as the industry becomes more established.

“The economics of the industry are changing and becoming more challenging, which can be seen in the squeezed GVA for the industry in 2022. Policymakers must continue to focus on creating competitive conditions for renewable energy to ensure we reap the economic benefits of the energy transition.

“We will be working in partnership with Scottish renewables over 2025 and 2026 to produce improved outputs from the data available, including a consistent time series – look out for our next update in early 2026.”",https://fraserofallander.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cropped-Shutterstock_1612511572.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 13:19:54.584168

Time is of the essence ... We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics.”

— Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA

HOUSTON , TX, UNITED STATES, May 28, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- PV Hardware USA (PVH USA), a global leader in solar tracking and foundation solutions, announced today it has the capacity to immediately Safe Harbor 5GW of tracker product, offering solar developers a critical opportunity to preserve eligibility for current clean energy tax credits amid legislative uncertainty.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While it has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, the legislation in its current form poses significant implications for the solar industry. PVH is encouraging developers to prepare accordingly.

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA. “We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics.”

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project’s total capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been incurred before any new legislative changes take effect. By procuring tracker products now, developers can lock in the current, more favorable incentive structure. PVH USA’s readiness to support up to 5GW of Safe Harbor product can help developers meet these CAPEX thresholds quickly, mitigating risk and preserving the long-term viability of their projects.

“PVH’s scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,” Bitar said. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country’s largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. To date, the IRA is cited with helping to generate 330,000 new clean energy jobs and more than $70 billion in private investment in the American economy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

It comes at a time when the future of current tax credit schemes, both for manufacturing and deploying clean energy technologies, are under threat.

The budget reconciliation bill aka ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’, passed by the House of Representatives, the lower house of Congress on 22 May, seeks to eliminate production tax credits (PTCs) and investment tax credits (ITCs) for technologies including energy storage.

If passed in its present form by the Senate, the bill would limit the availability of tax credits to projects that begin construction within 60 days of US President Donald Trump signing it into law and enter commercial operation by the end of 2028.

They had been due to run until 2032, with the percentage of capex support phasing out gradually each year.

Bill would hand competitive advantage to China, industry groups say

Response to the bill has been fierce from industry sectors, including solar PV and energy storage.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association (ACP), which represents energy storage companies since its merger with the former national Energy Storage Association (ESA) in 2022, said the House had “voted to immediately end the clean energy tax incentives that provide economic growth, good-paying jobs, and low-cost electricity to millions of Americans”.

“By a margin of one vote [the bill passed by 215 votes to 214], the House voted to retreat in our competition with China for manufacturing jobs and to weaken our technology sector in the global race for digital dominance,” Grumet said.

“For the good of our country’s energy security and energy bills—this cannot stand.”

Many others spoke out, including fellow trade associations Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE), which said in a statement that tax credits have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades, “and are key to driving America’s energy expansion as we face unprecedented energy demand.”

BCSE pointed out that tax credits have led to the creation of more than 400,000 jobs in energy, spurred more than 260 new manufacturing facilities and attracted US$133 billion of private sector investments to date.

‘US demand has skyrocketed while production moved overseas’

With the fate of tax credits—among many other things—now in the hands of the Upper House, the trade groups urged Senators to reject the approach laid out in the bill.

Fluence has long been vocal about its strategy of building up its domestic supply chain and manufacturing capabilities within the US.

It announced the Utah factory in 2022, and production there began last year, while earlier this month it opened a BESS enclosure assembly plant in Arizona. It also sources battery cells for about half of its projects in the country from a factory operated by AESC in Tennessee and buys other components from within the US.

However, the reality is that the energy storage industry remains largely dependent on imported materials, components and solutions from abroad, largely from China. The bill’s other provisions include prohibitions on relying on so-called foreign entities of concern (FEOC), and cutting off major supply chains without giving the US domestic industry enough runway to become mature could also be damaging to the fate of clean energy industries, along with the removal of tax credits.

Even the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), which praised the legislation’s pro-US manufacturing provisions, cited the need for an “all-of-the-above tax code” that would “support an all-of-the-above electricity grid that can meet rising demand and maintain affordability for American families.”

“We are concerned that prematurely phasing out key energy tax credits will slow these essential infrastructure investments, stifle economic growth and job creation, and have a chilling effect on our shared objectives of growing domestic manufacturing, expanding energy dominance, and winning the AI race with China,” a NEMA statement last week read.

“When the industry first started putting battery storage onto the grid in 2008, the core equipment was sourced from facilities in the United States,” Fluence’s Americas president John Zahurancik said.

“Since then, production has largely shifted overseas, even though US domestic demand has skyrocketed,” Zahurancik said, claiming that facilities like Fluence’s in Utah are “helping to build the foundation for the United States to once again be a leader in battery manufacturing.”

Senator Curtis said his visit to the Tooele County facility allowed him to see the value of tax credit incentives in “meeting both our energy production and economic development goals”.

Fluence posted a short video recap of Curtis’ visit, including remarks from the Utah senator and John Zahurancik, which you can see below.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fluence-Utah-senator-John-Curtis-with-Zahurancik-may25.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 09:11:46.054811

Notably, the IRA allows firms to develop and sell energy tax credits, as outlined here, to advance its goals of reducing emissions while also boosting domestic manufacturing and innovation.

In our last update, available here, we discussed how Trump’s withdrawal from global climate agreements and open disdain for the “Green New Deal” signaled a deliberate shift away from clean energy, making a reversal of the IRA seem inevitable.

That reversal is now underway. As many feared, the House advanced its budget on May 22 summarized here, which would significantly pare back the IRA’s clean energy initiatives to help offset the cost of other items, such as the anticipated extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) provisions.

Released under the banner of “Working Families Over Elites,” the bill would eliminate several consumer-facing tax credits, including credits for purchasing electric vehicles, installing charging infrastructure, and making home energy efficiency upgrades. Some limited exceptions would extend the ability to claim a credit through 2026.

The bill would also eliminate the credit for clean hydrogen production, widely viewed as one of the more innovative (if often misunderstood) technologies sanctioned by the IRA.

Most significantly, the bill would gut the technology-neutral investment tax credit (“ITC”) and production tax credit (“PTC”)—two of the cornerstones of the IRA, as we introduced here—by eliminating the credit for projects that have not begun construction within 60 days after the bill’s enactment or are not placed in service before the end of 2028 (with an exception for qualifying nuclear facilities). The bill would also disallow the credit for residential wind and solar property that is leased to a third party.

Additionally, the bill would eliminate the ability to sell the clean fuel production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2027, the latter of which was on track to become one of the most widely claimed credits under the IRA. The bill would also eliminate transferability for the carbon sequestration credit two years after its enactment, along with the investment credit for certain energy property.

Although the IRA tax credits were structured as 10-year incentives set to expire after 2032, with some credits subject to phase-outs, the bill would shorten that timeline by terminating the nuclear power production credit and the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2031. It’s possible that future revisions could further accelerate the phase-out of these credits, as proposed in the initial House draft.

Beyond these timing restrictions, the bill would impose “foreign entity of concern” limitations across several provisions—which we anticipated here—amid growing concerns over China’s dominance in critical supply chains like solar panels, batteries and critical minerals.

But even as those restrictions gain political traction, the popularity of the credits has prompted a more cautious tone from some policymakers. Earlier in May, a group of House Republicans wrote a letter urging their colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee to preserve the IRA credits, citing both the need to position the U.S. as a global energy leader and concerns over rising energy costs. That warning, however, may have fallen on deaf ears.

The Tax Foundation estimates here that fully repealing the IRA’s clean energy incentives would raise $851 billion. By contrast, the scaled-back proposal currently on the table would raise only about a third of that amount—leading some Republicans to argue that it doesn’t go far enough.

Uncertainty persists, but as the IRA approaches its third anniversary, one thing is clear: the market for credit transfers is huge, with market analysts estimating that total volume exceeded $24 billion in 2024.

“It’s going to be a boon for a lot of different resources,” Thompson replied.
These experiences create the bridge into both worlds of data center load and power generation capacity.
No one size, resource or capacity fits every data center capacity challenge.","So much noise being made at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), hyperscale data centers and the legacy power grid. Most of us hear it loud and clear like a clarion call.

Some voices are telling us that trouble is ahead, that the energy sector isn’t ready for AI. A few are saying there’s no problem, nothing to see here.

Few of those experts in AI or energy have worked extensively across both sectors, much less at the same time. Everett Thompson, founder and CEO of data center site broker WiredRE, has worked with hyperscalers, utilities, colocation developers, power engineering firms and communications infrastructure builders throughout his career.

Thompson clearly recognizes the sense of criticality facing the nation with dozens of gigawatts forecast to come online this decade even though the electric utility sector was anticipating flat load growth. No doubt there’s a challenge happening as power generation and delivery utilities grapple with artificial intelligence and quantum computing, yet maybe one answer does not fit all when it comes to satisfying data center load of the future.

We are entering an Industrial Compute Age, Thompson says. And the U.S. must stay ahead to survive as a technology leader in this unprecedented era.

The national interest cannot be served by software or private industry alone. The nation needs a new paradigm to meet the challenges of supplying enough energy while also leading the new age of AI, quantum and cloud computing.

“When you show up with experience in all those different layers, your perspective is often quite different,” Thompson said in an exclusive interview with EnergyTech. “It’s not a simple answer, and it’s almost always a regional answer.”

Creating a new paradigm for energy and big tech

The new paradigm may revolutionize the power grid like nothing since the first half of the 20th century. Data centers may revert to on-site power and become their own mini-utilities, Thompson predicted, and governments will need to play a major role as they did the evolution of railroads and power plants of the past.

Thompson and WiredRE are engaged in huge movements around the data center and cloud-based expansion happening now and anticipated for at least the next decade or beyond. The company recently acquired, re-developed and then sold a 1-GW AI-focused site west of Dallas that will house Google’s servers, creating perhaps the biggest single interconnection yet into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid system.

One gigawatt is massive by anyone’s calculations yet only a fraction of what’s coming, according to data center growth forecasts from researchers such as McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Bain and others. At the same time, and with an inverse pace of movement, the electric utility sector spent a decade accepting the notion of flat load growth, now finding itself potentially outmatched for AI and quantum computing demand.

“Nobody was paying much attention to it even two years ago,” Thompson said. Interconnection challenges are time-consuming and that hasn’t changed.

“Everybody still wants an interconnection agreement,” he said, referring to energy resources connected into the primary macro grid, “but dealing with a slow-moving utility is difficult. That’s not a cost issue, that’s bureaucratic. How do we overcome that in a way that our entire nation can be elevated?”

AI and quantum computing certainly are key to national security and economic leadership. China recently unveiled its DeepSeek AI technology that showed that the energy density of computing demand doesn’t have to be an consumption hog.

Creating opportunities to boost resources and renew infrastructure

And perhaps solutions in the national interest are, like most politics, truly local at heart. Data centers are a cluster industry, often intensely focused geographically in regions like northern Virginia and Texas, which facilitate interconnection into massive grids.

The location of data centers, however, also offers opportunities for microgrids, engaging a multitude of resources from gas-fired power to renewables, battery storage and both conventional, restarted nuclear plants and future small modular reactors. Texas and West Virginia are among the states looking into this.

“It’s going to be a boon for a lot of different resources,” Thompson replied. “I think self-generation is being adopted. . . This is an amazing opportunity to renew our infrastructure and our regional industries.”

Revolutionizing power at the edge of the grid is a good move, many say, but not the only one. Collaboration is key as federal, state and local political leadership are necessary to help fund an industrial revolution-level change on the seismic level of AI and quantum, he added.

What was not known then must be learned now and at hyperspeed pace as well as hyperscale volume.

“How do you turn the ship overnight? It must be government leadership,” Thompson pointed out. “It’s going to take public-private partnerships. If this is a moon shot, which I think it is, the government needs to create some sort of support.”

AI forces acceleration of all the game plans

In his quarter-century career cutting data center, financing and infrastructure deals, Thompson has consulted on behalf of customers as diverse as Iron Mountain, AT&T, Amazon, Goldman, Citibank and the U.S. Department of Energy. His cloud and data expertise were polished working for and with site developers such as Equinix, CoreSite, Rackspace, Digital Realty and others.

Thompson started his career with global engineering giant Foster Wheeler, spending ample time within power plant projects. These experiences create the bridge into both worlds of data center load and power generation capacity.

And yet, while he tends to accept the forecasts of 50-GW future load growth because of AI and cloud computing, Thompson also sees opportunities for micro-efficiency and local generation.

“AI is like a different voltage,” he said. “Acceleration is making the existing infrastructure more powerful.”

In fact, he’s high on the notion of on-site power for this so-called Industrial Compute Age.

Sometimes the new is forced to use the old when alternatives are not quickly available. In one controversial example, Elon Musk’s $6 billion Colossus AI supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, is being powered by a host of simple-cycle gas-fired turbines which are drawing the ire of local and national environmentalists.

Meanwhile, in a show that natural gas must play a role in the near future of AI expansion, major energy players such as Chevron are exploring gas-fired interconnections while others, such as DC Grid, are looking at direct-current and off-grid projects.

No one size, resource or capacity fits every data center capacity challenge. China’s DeepSeek has shown that efficiency can be part of power, too.

“The U.S. is so resource rich that sometimes it just throws resources at things,” Thompson noted.

But the resources are there or can be, with public-private partnerships developing an “all of the above” approach utilizing renewables, historically rich gas reserves, future nuclear, carbon capture, battery storage and perhaps even hydrogen.

Farmers benefit from a higher biofuels mandate, but oil refiners have historically opposed it.
The biofuels industry disagrees.
“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, US president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj.
“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.","After losing their biggest export market due to Donald Trump’s trade wars, US farmers are now counting on the president’s support for biofuels to prevent their next crop from piling up in storage.

The administration is set to soon unveil a plan for how much crop-based biofuels will be blended into fossil fuels starting next year. A higher mandate, still opposed by some in the oil industry, would create a much needed outlet for crops after tariffs hit China — the top commodities buyer simply has no orders for corn, soybeans or wheat from the next harvest on its books, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

“If we don’t get this done, we’ll end up with a surplus of soybeans,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is also president of the American Soybean Association, said of the upcoming biofuels mandate. “I can store one good crop, I can’t store multiple years.”

Trump instigated a $28 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the economic standoff with Beijing during his first term. While his administration is considering similar plans again, so far he has only pledged to find domestic markets to compensate for lost sales abroad.

Boosting demand at home is a key priority for growers, industry groups and some of the top agricultural commodity traders. That’s because overseas sales of soybeans from the next crop are currently running 79% below the average of the past five years, USDA data showed. Corn sales are 49% lower.

The US farm economy was already struggling before Trump’s trade disputes. Bumper crops globally boosted supplies and sent a Bloomberg gauge of grain prices tumbling more than 40% since a 2022 peak.

For Trump and the Republican party, reinforcing the farmer vote ahead of next year’s midterm elections will be key. American growers have been a loyal constituency, but some cracks in that support have started to emerge.

An AgWeb poll of almost 3,000 farmers earlier this year revealed that 54% were against Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating strategy. A group of growers from Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi also sued the administration after the USDA canceled grants under a program to install solar panels.

The April Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer found that 56% of respondents expect tariffs to have a negative or very negative impact on farm income this year. Still, 70% said the policy will strengthen the US agricultural economy in the long-term.

Domestic Demand

“If we’re going to get behind this America First policy, let’s make sure that we have a great domestic policy strategy,” said Lucas Lentsch, a North Dakota farmer who heads the United Soybean Board. “Let’s make sure we’ve got good demand here at home.”

Creating more markets at home is easier said than done. The US cattle herd is already at the lowest since the 1950s, curbing demand for crops in feed rations. That’s leaving farmers reliant on the so-called renewable volume obligation, or RVOs — a rule that’s been controversial since being enshrined into law two decades ago to safeguard energy security.

Farmers benefit from a higher biofuels mandate, but oil refiners have historically opposed it. Some of that has since changed as Big Oil invested in biofuels in recent years as part of their decarbonization efforts.

“We need a robust RVO to keep US soybeans a profitable business to be in,” said Greg Anderson, who grows the oilseed in Nebraska.

Biofuel Mandates

Agribusiness giants Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Bunge Global SA and Cargill Inc., as well as trade groups including the Clean Fuels Alliance America want the Environmental Protection Agency to set the RVO at no less than 5.25 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel starting next year, up 60% from 2025 levels.

Farm lobby groups and US Midwestern governors also want a mandate for US ethanol of at least the 15 billion gallons currently in place.

The American Petroleum Institute is also backing the requests.

“We’re certainly doing our job to push administration to help us and help the industry,” Christopher Cuddy, ADM’s president of carbohydrate solutions, said at a BMO conference in New York this month. “The most encouraging piece for me is the fact that we’re aligned with the Petroleum Institute, which at least in my time has never happened.”

Still, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents some refiners, is against it. The group argues the US isn’t selling enough gasoline to absorb so much ethanol and that there’s uncertainty over the amount of feedstock available to produce more renewable diesel and other biomass-based biofuels.

The biofuels industry disagrees. Randall Stuewe, chief executive officer of Darling Ingredients Inc., said the previous quotas set under former President Joe Biden were far too low. The company’s Diamond Green Diesel venture with Valero Energy Corp. is a top producer of renewable fuels.

That led to a number of factory closures. Biodiesel plants in the US produced at just 51% of capacity in the year through April, while facilities that make renewable diesel — a fuel that’s chemically identical to its fossil fuel peer — ran at a rate of 72%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Project Tracker.

“We used to have more demand than supply, it’s now reversed,” said Peter Zonneveld, US president for biofuels producer Neste Oyj. “Some companies are reducing run rates or shelving their investment plans for renewable fuels,” which will make it harder to curb emissions from heavy-duty industries, he said.

“It’s resulting in difficulties for the ag industry too because farmers can’t get rid of their soybeans,” Zonneveld said.

In a statement to Bloomberg, the EPA said it has already sent its biofuel-blending proposal to the White House and will make it available for public comment once the proposal is signed.

The US biofuels program “supports President Trump’s broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices,” the agency said.

A higher RVO is a chance to get domestic biofuels back up to normalized run rates of around 80%, said Brett Gibbs, a renewable energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who estimates the mandate will need to be at least 3.9 billion gallons to bring some facilities back online.

Trade Uncertainty

It’s unclear how the EPA will balance the concerns of some refiners and the agriculture industry. And even as the president announced a truce with China, lowering tariffs for 90 days, uncertainty remains.

Sales of next season’s crops to Mexico and Japan, the second and third-largest soybean buyers, are lagging well behind historical levels for this time of year. And China continues to snap up supplies from rival Brazil.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has openly hinted at a bailout, and nearly two thirds of farmers in the March Purdue/CME barometer said aid was either likely or very likely. Still, many growers say they want to sell their crops instead of receiving aid.

“As a farmer, I’d rather receive it from the market,” said Philip Good, a Mississippi farmer who’s the chair of the United Soybean Board. “We go back to the domestic markets, and developing domestic uses.”

Familiar industrial robots — but not yet humanoid Atlas robots — even install bulky car doors on the assembly line.","Driving a 2026 Ioniq 9 SUV around the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant in Georgia can feel like a victory lap for the South Korean automaker. Hyundai’s electric flagship carves out room for three America-centric rows of seats, from a booming brand whose EVs and hybrids already make up one in every four US sales.

Even better, the Ioniq 9 and smaller Ioniq 5 are emerging from a futuristic new factory in America, giving Hyundai a defensible bulwark against the tariffs and onshoring fervor of Donald Trump’s administration. As I watch these electric SUVs roll off a surgically clean assembly line, Hyundai’s opportunistic timing looms as large as the hulking robots that help build its cars.

A tour of the $7.6 billion factory also underlines how many automakers are plowing ahead with long-laid EV plans, regardless of Category 5 Washington winds that threaten to blow away Joe Biden-era support for EV manufacturing, consumer tax credits, and public charging.

Hyundai’s opportunistic timing looms as large as the hulking robots that help build its cars

Seen from the air en route to Savannah, the Metaplant resembles a printed circuit board on a green background, blown up to epic scale. Eleven low-slung, pale-green buildings dot 3,000 acres of Georgia countryside, with a total 7.5 million square feet of space. One building houses a $4 billion battery plant, a joint operation with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution, that plans to begin supplying cells for Ioniq models next year. The company is racing to open a second battery plant in Georgia, a roughly $5 billion joint operation with SK On. A forthcoming steel plant in Louisiana further underscores Hyundai’s commitment to its largest global market. It’s all part of a $21 billion investment in America between now and 2028, the vast majority pledged during the EV-friendly Biden administration.

No humans required

Pulling into the factory, I watch a conveyor carry freshly painted cars across a windowed bridge. It’s designed to let drivers on Interstate 16 see the fruits of a plant that will ultimately produce 500,000 EVs and hybrids a year — more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory, with its 375,000-car capacity. Georgians may also see their tax dollars at work. The publicly supported plant already employs 1,340 “Metapros,” enough to boost the automaker’s annual local payroll to $497 million. Hyundai foresees an eventual 8,500 jobs on-site, and another 7,000 satellite jobs for local suppliers and businesses.

That’s a lot of jobs. Compared with the Detroit-area factory where I toiled in the 1980s, a depressing maelstrom of heat, dirt, toxic chemicals, and industrial accidents, this joint is like MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.

But the factory also highlights a catch-22 of modern manufacturing, one that Trump’s economic advisors seem to overlook, intentionally or otherwise: To have any chance of competing with China’s EV-and-battery juggernaut, factories must enlist growing armies of AI-enhanced robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never demand overtime or benefits. That means employing relatively fewer humans.

At the factory loading docks, Autonomous Guided Vehicles, or AGVs, busily unload parts from semitrucks. Roughly 300 of these robotic sleds roam the factory with no tracks required, neatly avoiding workers or obstacles. AI informs the entire factory operation, from procurement to logistics to production.

Roughly 300 of these robotic sleds roam the factory with no tracks required

These AGVs are common in today’s factories, but I’ve never seen them at this scale, or a certain tag-team maneuver: A pair of sleds slide below finished Hyundais as they roll off the line. They squeeze the cars’ wheels in robotic arms, hoist them off the ground, and ferry cars where they need to go. I’ve visited car factories around the world, and this is the first I’ve seen where an employee doesn’t have to start cars and drive them away.

Automated vehicles also carry every component to the assembly line for efficient “just-in-time” installation, no humans required. That avoids wasting money and labor stockpiling huge backlogs of parts.

“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make decisions” or losing time to mistakes, says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly.

Man’s best friend does make an appearance. A pair of robotic dogs named “Spot,” bred by the Hyundai-owned, Massachusetts-based Boston Dynamics, scan and sniff out potential defects on car welds. Those yellow-coated dogs may soon be joined by humanoid robots, the AI-driven “Atlas” models that Hyundai plans to deploy throughout its factories in the future. The dexterous biped bots — whose ability to cartwheel, breakdance, and barrel roll already outdoes most auto workers — appear outwardly friendly, but will strike any sentient human as a potential Terminator of jobs. (Hyundai executives insist that is not the case).

The welding shop alone houses 475 industrial robots, piecing together the building blocks of a car chassis. A steel stamping plant is so spookily quiet that no ear protection is required, even as robots stamp out roofs, fenders, and other body panels in a whirling, complicated dance. As with many leading-edge factories, there are strikingly few workers beyond the assembly line itself; I spot only a few dozen at work in the cavernous welding hall.

Familiar industrial robots — but not yet humanoid Atlas robots — even install bulky car doors on the assembly line. Roach says that job is notoriously tough for workers to manage without potentially damaging painted surfaces. Such “collaborative” robots must be safe and reliable enough to operate alongside humans without physical separation required.

“This is a real-life factory of the future,” Roach says.

Clean energy targets

Those kinds of jobs, involving massively heavy lifting, repetitive tasks, or computerized speed and accuracy, are “prime things” to automate, Roach says. Other jobs require the tactile precision that only human hands and vision provide.

“I want my people doing craftsmanship,” Roach says. “I want to pay people well for the things they do well, and take away all the stuff that’s tedious and boring, the jobs people don’t want to do.”

Of course, some people might not mind tedious or heavy-lifting jobs that also pay a generous living wage. But there’s no going back to the days when it took many thousands of workers to keep a factory humming; Ford’s River Rouge complex, designed by Albert Kahn, employed more than 100,000 workers during World War II.

Twenty-first-century carmaking also means the latest in green tech. The Metaplant targets obtaining 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Trucks that haul parts here daily from a localized supply chain are powered by hydrogen fuel cells and produce zero tailpipe emissions. The 21-truck fleet is built by the Hyundai-owned XCIENT, the world’s first commercialized fuel-cell semis.

Employees can park in nearly 1,900 spaces beneath solar roofs, shielded from baking Georgia sun, which provides up to five percent of the plant’s electricity. The bulk of the factory’s finished cars are shipped by rail rather than truck, trimming the plant’s carbon footprint.

Credit where credit’s due

Hyundai hopes those trains will work overtime shipping the 2026 Ioniq 9. Buyers will find a spacious, more affordable foil to a Rivian R1S or Tesla Model X, with 50 percent more cargo space behind its third row than Tesla. The sister car to the critically acclaimed Kia EV9 is the most expensive Hyundai yet, starting from $60,595 for a single-motor model with a modest 215 horsepower. The cocooning, thoroughly pleasant-driving SUV gets a 110 kilowatt-hour battery that supplies a generous 335 miles of driving range, or a still-solid 311 to 320 miles for AWD versions. It’s stuffed with useful tech, including a curling pair of conjoined 12.3-inch screens, 100-watt USB-C connectors, and active noise cancellation.

Ioniq 9 prospects may focus on a particularly compelling piece of tech: an onboard Tesla NACS connector opens the wide world of Tesla Supercharging to buyers. (The smaller Ioniq 5, which kicked off Georgia production in October, was the first non-Tesla with a native NACS plug). Like other EVs with advanced architectures of 800 or more volts, the Ioniq 9 doesn’t charge at its peak rates on Superchargers. But Hyundai still cites a 10-to-80-percent refill in 40 minutes. That drops to 24 minutes on the most powerful 350-kilowatt CCS chargers from Electrify America. Ioniq 9s will come with free adapters to plug into CCS stations, opening access to a total 45,000 DC stalls in America.

The Ioniq 9 is stuffed with useful tech

Hyundai was also hoping to lure Ioniq buyers with a $7,500 consumer tax credit, including by switching Ioniq 5 production from South Korea to Georgia. For the Ioniq 9 I tested — a top-shelf, $75,000 Calligraphy AWD model with 422 horsepower from a pair of electric motors — that credit would represent 10 percent of the price. But now the Trump administration is turning on electrified cars, the majority built in Republican-led states, in unprecedented, nearly malicious fashion. It is kneecapping those credits, blocking public money for chargers, and saddling EVs and hybrids with annual fees for road maintenance.

Hyundai had also taken its lumps under the Biden administration: The IRA made its imported EVs ineligible for tax credits, despite Hyundai’s pledge of billions of dollars in US investment. José Muñoz, Hyundai’s global president, made it clear the company felt blindsided and unfairly sidelined from credits.

The Metaplant was one answer, allowing Hyundai to shift Ioniq 5 production from South Korea. That boosts the model’s percentage of US- and Canadian-made parts from a piddling two percent to 63 percent, including US-sourced batteries. For the Ioniq 9, the North American share sits at 60 percent. Finally, Hyundai could tout both American-made Ioniq models as being fully eligible for $7,500 consumer tax credits, as executives did during my plant tour.

But in a bitter irony, a Hyundai that crossed oceans and moved mountains to jump-start US production of Hyundai, Kia, and luxury Genesis EVs is about to be shut out of credits. Again.

There are lessons in there, somewhere. For tariff proponents, the Metaplant might be a $7.6 billion lesson in reality: No American factory can screw together a single car without some share of imported parts, including from a China that holds a near-monopoly on several raw or processed battery materials.

For automakers, including (surely envious) Hyundai rivals now under pressure to onshore their own factories, the lessons are different. They must deal with the Trump administration’s ever-changing tariff moods, in a business that lives for long-term clarity, regulatory consistency, and economic stability.

For every EV maker, including a Hyundai Motor that seemingly did everything by the book, a conclusion appears inescapable: They are on their own. Expect no help from Washington, but rather potential hurt. The only possible strategy is to roll up their sleeves, keep their heads down, and avoid further kicks to the teeth.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Large-64277-HMGMAReveals2026IONIQ9asNewestProductionVehicle.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.730898395945%2C100%2C78.53820320811&w=1200,N,,2025-05-29 09:12:33.462754

$14 billion in clean energy projects have been canceled in the US this year, analysis says (Photo: AP)

More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the US have been cancelled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump's pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development. Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked. The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs. The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations. Last week's House bill effectively renders moot many of the law's incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed. ""The House's plan coupled with the administration's focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,"" E2 executive director Bob Keefe said. The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president's desk. What has been canceled Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner's closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press. Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies' plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025. Of the projects canceled this year, most, more than $12 billion worth, came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say. Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis. ""If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I'm not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,"" said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved. A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate majority leader John Thune, R-SD that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county's position as a global energy leader. The US and the global stage The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden's environmental and climate-related policy - what he calls the Democrats' ""green new scam"" - withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led ""American energy dominance"" agenda. Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent ""carbon leakage,"" or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping. In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the US, April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi's energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan. Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2's tally.

The company was sold to cryptocurrency firm Bitfarms this year.

At Stronghold, Beard went on a public relations offensive. In interviews with cryptocurrency enthusiasts in recent years, he touted environmental benefits of the company’s work.

“We are remediating a waste coal problem that we didn’t create ourselves,” he told podcast host Will Foxley in 2023. “We really view ourselves as environmentalists.”

Local activists disagree. Instead, they say Stronghold made many local environmental problems much worse.

In March, spurred by litigation from Earthjustice and a local environmental group called the Scrubgrass Creek Watershed Association, Stronghold and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection struck a deal to clean up an unpermitted dump of coal ash, which is a byproduct of burning waste coal.

Bill Pritchard, a member of the Scrubgrass association, said the coal ash pile grew out of control — from only eight inches permitted by the state to a whopping seven stories high.

“Stronghold was issued a permit, and the expectation was they would follow the permit. They did not follow the permit,” Pritchard said in an interview. “I find it reprehensible. It’s a blatant disregard for the environment.”

A 2023 complaint from Scrubgrass shared with POLITICO’s E&E News outlines the Pennsylvania DEP’s inspections of the site. Scrubgrass has repeatedly violated air quality and other environmental regulations, according to EPA and the Pennsylvania DEP. Meanwhile, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in 2023 shows companies like McClymonds Supply & Transit Co. and Allegheny Mineral Corp. had to fight to get paid after performing services for Stronghold.

Bitcoin and the Trump administration

Beard adds to a striking list of cryptocurrency supporters with formal positions in the Trump administration.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a former crypto investor, gave an interview last month to Bitcoin Magazine on the White House grounds. Trump’s crypto czar, David Sacks, is heavily involved in the cryptocurrency world, as are other top Trump officials like Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for the Middle East and founder of crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and Trump adviser David Bailey, who this month launched a bitcoin company.

Even new SEC Chair Paul Atkins sat on the advisory board of crypto firm Securitize Inc. and istied to the bankrupted FTX cryptocurrency platform.

President Donald Trump’s election is proving a cryptocurrency boon in other ways too — one with a flurry of potential conflicts of interest for the president, his family and many luminaries in Trump world.

The $TRUMP memecoin sell-off is sparking accusations of pay-for-play access to Trump. American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., recently said it would go public. The White House also created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March.

On Capitol Hill last week, the Senate advanced a first-ever regulatory overhaul for digital currencies known as stablecoins, which are pegged to the dollar. More crypto legislation could move this Congress.

The price of bitcoin surged after Trump’s election in November. After a dip in February and March, it’s now fetching some of its highest prices ever.

Energy demand and DOE

Producing, or “mining,” cryptocurrencies involves sophisticated computations and a lot of electricity.

Bitcoin is particularly energy-intensive due to its use of “proof of work,” a process of validating transactions, according to experts. The Energy Information Administration said last year that cryptocurrencies could be using more than 2 percent of U.S. electricity.

Analysts expect a big jump in energy demand over the coming years, spurred by artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and broad electrification of the U.S. economy, from electric cars to household appliances. A new report from the firm ICF says U.S. power demand is likely to grow by a staggering 25 percent by 2030.

During the Biden administration, the DOE Loan Programs Office, which typically makes loans to energy projects that can’t get traditional financing from private institutions, financed a range of new energy technologies that could help to provide more power for the U.S., including advanced batteries and virtual power plants.

The loan office ultimately closed roughly $61 billion in loans and loan guarantees, much of that in the waning weeks of the Biden administration, sparking criticism from Republicans. Experts now expect the office to dramatically curtail lending.

Meanwhile, clean energy advocates, including former Biden administration officials, question Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s decision-making in bringing on personnel like Beard.

“I think Chris Wright’s actually a genuinely good guy, but then he brings in people like this who do not know how to do debt,” a former DOE official in the Biden administration who was granted anonymity to speak freely told E&E News.

For a decade, Beard worked at Apollo Global Management, a firm that lends to energy companies.

Beard’s connections to the Trump administration are unclear. Both Wright and Beard backed fracking and horizontal drilling, whose innovations reinvigorated the U.S. oil and gas industry this century by providing access to shale deposits unreachable with traditional drilling.

Before taking the DOE Cabinet post, Wright led Liberty Energy, a fracking services firm. And in a 2014 story published in Hart Magazine, Beard predicted big spending on fracking.

“As an industry, we are going to be spending hundreds of billions of dollars drilling shale,” Beard said at the time.

Apollo did not respond to a request for comment. DOE also did not make Beard available for an interview or answer questions regarding his status and history.

Waste coal

Stronghold operated two power generation facilities that supplied electricity to mine bitcoin on site: one at the Panther Creek Electric Generating Facility south of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and the other at the Scrubgrass generating facility in Kennerdell, a small town in a rural area north of Pittsburgh.

In 2023, a New York Times article listed both facilities, which operate today as part of Bitfarms, as two of the biggest vertically integrated bitcoin operations in the U.S. According to the industry group Appalachian Region Independent Power Producers Association (ARIPPA), the plants now run at 80 megawatts and 83 megawatts, respectively.

While some U.S. power plants exceed 1,000 megawatts, the Stronghold plants are considered medium-size. They’re only slightly smaller than some gas-powered plants, and they’re buoyed by big subsidies for waste coal remediation and electricity sent to the grid. Those incentives were central to the business model adopted by Beard and Stronghold.

“We get paid a payment per ton that we reclaim. And then we also get renewable energy credits,” he told podcast host Jesse Pielke last year. “We’re a reclamation business where the byproduct of that is power, and we use the power to make bitcoin.”

Meanwhile, earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cracked down on Stronghold for violating PJM Interconnection power rules. Stronghold agreed to pay roughly $1.4 million in penalties and disgorgement.

Experts say the waste coal piles need serious attention — the piles are not treated or removed, they catch fire or leech pollutive metals into groundwater.

Jaret Gibbons, executive director of ARIPPA, emphasized the incentives offered by Pennsylvania to incinerate waste coal.

“What we end up with is usable land without all of the impurities,” he said in an interview. “The state has been very supportive.”

“We don’t really look at these facilities as power plants. We really see them as reclamation facilities,” Gibbons added.

But Mike Ewall, the Pennsylvania-based founder of Energy Justice Network, says incineration for power generation is the wrong approach.

“Burning them is the worst thing,” he told E&E News. “When you burn 100 tons of waste coal, you have 85 tons of waste coal ash left over. So this notion that we’re cleaning places up and making stuff disappear is not what’s happening at all.”

Kicking tires and lighting fires

Carol Etheridge, who lives only miles from the Stronghold crypto operation at Panther Creek, said she first smelled burning tires in 2023.

“I live downwind of it,” Etheridge, a member of the Save Carbon County environmental group, said of the plant, while making pasta salad in her kitchen. “When they incinerate tires — and tire-derived fuel — and we walk outside our house, we smell burning tires.”

The problem: Etheridge says Stronghold was yet not permitted to burn tires to produce electricity.

The PA DEP held a hearing on a proposal to burn tires at Panther Creek back in December 2023. The tire-burning plan was approved only in May this year. A complaint from Save Carbon County alleges that the PA DEP knew about the tire burning and did not stop it.

“These are bad actors. These are not good neighbors,” said Etheridge.

EPA says tire-derived fuel is an “available alternative to the use of fossil fuels” with similar pollution impacts. EPA data shows sulfur dioxide emissions at the plant grew roughly elevenfold from 2020 to 2023, as the crypto operation ramped up.

“This is not a battle we’re winning right now,” Etheridge said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/0e/d0/fd58b47f45d188e574684041832e/one-time-use-ee-gregbeard.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 08:01:10.923428

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

Peter Behr reports for E&E News.

In short:

Trump’s executive orders direct the NRC to overhaul safety regulations and accelerate reactor approvals, while involving other agencies like the Department of Energy and Department of Defense in reactor vetting and construction.

Critics, including former NRC chairs and nuclear experts, warn that diminishing the agency’s independence could erode public trust and compromise nuclear safety oversight.

Advanced nuclear technologies, many using untested fuels and cooling systems, pose unique risks that experts say require rigorous, independent review rather than expedited approval.

Key quote:

“Maintaining independent, effective regulation is essential to avoid serious consequences.”

— Amir Afzali, retired utility senior director with decades of experience in nuclear power

Why this matters:

On one hand, nuclear power offers a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels at a time of soaring electricity demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and climate targets. On the other, its history is riddled with expensive delays, safety controversies, and deep public skepticism. The Trump administration’s push to weaken the independence of the NRC — a regulator created to ensure public health and safety — rekindles old concerns about promoting nuclear energy at the expense of oversight. Unlike renewables, nuclear power carries catastrophic risk if mishandled. And the new reactor designs being championed come with unfamiliar engineering challenges, such as sodium-cooled systems that can ignite on contact with air. Experts caution that sidelining NRC’s safety process could increase the chances of error, and by involving politically appointed officials in what were once technical decisions, the administration may blur the lines between innovation and accountability.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60333326/origin.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 10:20:46.535958

Using the latest data available, Strathclyde University’s Fraser of Allander Institute reports that offshore wind continues to be the renewable energy technology supporting the most employment across the Scottish economy with 19,580 full time equivalent (FTE) roles while onshore wind supports 16,865 roles and renewable heat supports 4,095 roles.

Offshore wind also powered the most activity across the Scottish economy, generating more than £6.8 billion of output, followed by onshore wind with £6.4 billion and hydropower with £1.4 billion.

The Fraser of Allander Institute’s report assessed the economic impact of the renewable energy industry and its wider benefits in terms of supply chain activity and spending within the Scottish economy.

A measure of the industry has been estimated using data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) due to the lack of detailed information available through official UK or Scottish Government data. The 2022 results should be viewed as a standalone snapshot of activity rather than part of a continuous trend but nonetheless demonstrate the continued strong economic performance of the renewable energy industry in Scotland.

Claire Mack, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said:

“This report from the Fraser of Allander Institute offers an important snapshot of the economic value our members are creating as we move toward a future powered by clean, home-grown renewable energy. It reflects what we know about the activity in the industry through the development, construction and operation of major projects such as the Moray East offshore and Viking onshore windfarms.

“We know that the energy crisis, marked by sharp rises in wholesale costs, has had wide-reaching effects on industry and households. And while it became clear that accelerating the deployment of clean energy projects is the only way to reduce our exposure to the volatility of international gas prices, it also brought serious challenges with supply chain disruptions and rising input costs making projects more expensive to deliver.

“Our industry is working closely with government to tackle these challenges in order to build more projects and build our future jobs. Scotland is set to play a key role in achieving the UK’s clean power goal for 2030 meaning that Scotland’s renewable energy industry will continue to drive growth and employment across the Scottish and UK economy.

“We urge the UK and Scottish governments to enable more robust data collection so we can continue to track performance of the renewable energy industry and our contribution to growth across the UK.”

Scottish Renewables and the Fraser of Allander Institute have published two previous editions of this report on the economic impact of renewable energy in Scotland.

In 2022, the global energy crisis accelerated demand for renewable energy while industry also faced significant challenges, including supply chain disruptions and rising input costs, which made projects more expensive to deliver. Whilst this has boosted turnover and output across the industry, rising operational and material costs have meant constrained growth in gross value added (GVA) and the creation of full-time jobs.

Professor Mairi Spowage, Director of Fraser of Allander Institute, said:

“We have seen a significant shift in economic activity associated with the renewable energy industry in 2022, as more capacity comes online and moves from construction to generation. These shifts change the nature of the supply chains supported, which is likely to continue as the industry becomes more established.

“The economics of the industry are changing and becoming more challenging, which can be seen in the squeezed GVA for the industry in 2022. Policymakers must continue to focus on creating competitive conditions for renewable energy to ensure we reap the economic benefits of the energy transition.

“We will be working in partnership with Scottish Renewables over 2025 and 2026 to produce improved outputs from the data available, including a consistent time series – look out for our next update in early 2026.”

This was the 61st year for the annual contest, and winners were announced at an awards dinner in Pittsburgh on May 28th.

Ferrell and Marusic won in the science/environment category for excellence in written journalism for their co-reported series on federally-funded hydrogen hub projects across the country, which uncovered a lack of transparency in the planning process and documented widespread frustration in communities anticipating hydrogen energy development, including those in Texas and western Pennsylvania. Videographer Jimmy Evans also received recognition for his work on the video feature for that reporting.

""It's an honor to be recognized among so many talented journalists,"" said Ferrell, who visited Pittsburgh for the first time to receive her award. ""I hope our reporting continues to have a positive impact.""

Marusic also won in both the enterprise/investigative and news feature categories for her series on chemical recycling in Appalachia, which documented community fights against proposed waste processing facilities in Youngstown, Ohio; Point Township, Pennsylvania; and Follansbee, West Virginia. That investigation also won one of four best-of-show Ray Sprigle Memorial Awards.

""I'm really proud to receive an award named for such an important journalist,"" said Marusic, who also won Golden Quill awards for her reporting on environmental health in western Pennsylvania in 2023, 2022 and 2020.

In short:

Scientists from the World Meteorological Organization and the UK Met Office predict an 80% chance that Earth will set another annual heat record by 2030, with at least one year likely to exceed the 1.5°C warming threshold.

The five-year outlook draws from over 200 simulations and signals an increasing probability that global temperatures may briefly reach 2°C above pre-industrial levels — the Paris climate agreement’s secondary limit once considered less likely.

Rising average temperatures will drive more deadly extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires, while Arctic regions warm more than three times faster than the global average.

Key quote:

“With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat.”

— Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office

Why this matters:

Even a slight uptick in global average temperature can wreak havoc on ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health. As the world flirts with the 1.5°C and 2°C warming thresholds outlined in the Paris Agreement, the risks grow starker: more heat deaths, strained water supplies, failing crops, and stronger storms. Vulnerable populations — the elderly, children, outdoor workers, and those without stable housing — will bear the brunt. With El Niño conditions amplifying long-term climate trends, the new forecast suggests the planet may settle into a more perilous climate baseline. The Arctic, already warming at alarming rates, will continue to lose ice and push sea levels higher. These changes aren't happening in isolation — they’re linked in a chain of cascading environmental stressors that endanger both public health and environmental stability.

In short:

The U.N. Ocean Conference, hosted by France and Costa Rica from June 7–13, will gather world leaders, businesses, and civil society groups to develop the Nice Ocean Action Plan targeting pollution, overfishing, and climate stress.

France seeks 60 ratifications for a high seas biodiversity treaty and plans to push for protections covering 30% of the world’s oceans, decarbonized shipping, and increased funding.

The Trump administration may open American Samoa’s seabed to mineral extraction, highlighting growing tensions over deep-sea mining, which is not addressed in the conference’s declaration due to lack of consensus.

Key quote:

“What is different this time around? Zero rhetoric. Maximum results.”

— Maritza Chan Valverde, Costa Rica’s U.N. Ambassador

Why this matters:

The health of the ocean underpins much of life on Earth, yet its systems are buckling under the weight of human activity. Rising ocean temperatures are intensifying storms and threatening marine biodiversity. Meanwhile, plastic pollution kills wildlife and contaminates seafood, while overfishing depletes key food sources for billions of people. Maritime shipping, a major carbon emitter, adds to the climate burden. Ocean degradation isn’t confined to the deep — it impacts food security, weather patterns, and economies everywhere, particularly in coastal communities and island nations. What happens to the oceans is a public health issue, a food justice issue, and a planetary one. And with some governments now eyeing deep-sea mining as a new industrial frontier, the stakes are rising. Any meaningful progress hinges on whether political promises made in Nice translate to legal enforcement and sustained funding.

In short:

Trump’s executive orders direct the NRC to overhaul safety regulations and accelerate reactor approvals, while involving other agencies like the Department of Energy and Department of Defense in reactor vetting and construction.

Critics, including former NRC chairs and nuclear experts, warn that diminishing the agency’s independence could erode public trust and compromise nuclear safety oversight.

Advanced nuclear technologies, many using untested fuels and cooling systems, pose unique risks that experts say require rigorous, independent review rather than expedited approval.

Key quote:

“Maintaining independent, effective regulation is essential to avoid serious consequences.”

— Amir Afzali, retired utility senior director with decades of experience in nuclear power

Why this matters:

On one hand, nuclear power offers a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels at a time of soaring electricity demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and climate targets. On the other, its history is riddled with expensive delays, safety controversies, and deep public skepticism. The Trump administration’s push to weaken the independence of the NRC — a regulator created to ensure public health and safety — rekindles old concerns about promoting nuclear energy at the expense of oversight. Unlike renewables, nuclear power carries catastrophic risk if mishandled. And the new reactor designs being championed come with unfamiliar engineering challenges, such as sodium-cooled systems that can ignite on contact with air. Experts caution that sidelining NRC’s safety process could increase the chances of error, and by involving politically appointed officials in what were once technical decisions, the administration may blur the lines between innovation and accountability.

In short:

U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman granted a temporary restraining order stopping the Trump administration from cutting transportation funding over New York’s tolling plan, keeping the congestion charge in place through June 9.

The M.T.A. argued that revoking the program would threaten $15 billion in funding for transit upgrades, while the Department of Transportation claimed the toll unfairly penalized drivers and misused federal road funds.

Legal challenges continue, but the judge signaled that the M.T.A. showed strong legal footing and that New York would suffer “irreparable harm” if the program were paused.

Key quote:

“If I were a lawyer at the M.T.A., I’d be feeling very good about my chances on final judgment.”

— Michael Pollack, professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law

Why this matters:

Congestion pricing is a tool that cities around the world — from London to Singapore — use to cut traffic, reduce pollution, and fund public transit. New York’s plan, the first of its kind in the U.S., aims to do all three by charging drivers who enter Manhattan’s central business district during peak hours. The logic is straightforward: Fewer cars means faster commutes, better air, and more money for trains and buses. But the policy faces stiff political headwinds, especially from car-centric interests and officials who see it as an unfair burden on suburban and working-class drivers. The battle now playing out in court could shape not just the future of New York’s streets but the broader national debate over how we fund and manage urban infrastructure in a warming world.

In short:

A Zillow study finds Black, Hispanic, and Asian homeowners are more likely than white homeowners to live in areas at high risk for extreme weather and climate-related hazards.

In Atlanta, 71% of Black homeowners face major wind risk compared with 39% of white homeowners; in San Jose, 43% of Hispanic homeowners face major wildfire risk versus 33% of white homeowners.

The disparities are linked to discriminatory redlining and income inequality, which have historically limited the housing options available to people of color.

Key quote:

“The racial wealth gap is likely a driving factor, with home buyers of color generally having fewer options within reach financially.”

— Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow

Why this matters:

Generations of discriminatory housing policies like redlining pushed families of color into neighborhoods more exposed to environmental hazards, from wildfire-prone foothills to flood-prone lowlands. Now, with rising insurance premiums and limited resources for adaptation or relocation, these families are more likely to bear the full brunt of climate disasters. A storm or heatwave can become not just a moment of crisis, but a financial breaking point, eroding intergenerational wealth and widening health disparities. Exposure to poor air quality and extreme heat can also worsen chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease. Climate injustice is mapped to ZIP codes, shaped by policy, and experienced in daily life by millions of Americans.

In short:

The high court’s decision lets stand a lower court ruling allowing the transfer of Oak Flat in the Tonto National Forest to Resolution Copper, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto and BHP.

Apache Stronghold argued the transfer violates religious freedoms and threatens a sacred site central to Apache ceremonies and beliefs, but the court rejected their plea.

Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented, warning that the ruling ends decades of government protection of Oak Flat and clears the way for its destruction.

Key quote:

“Recognizing Oak Flat’s significance, the government has long protected both the land and the Apaches’ access to it. No more. Now, the government and a mining conglomerate want to turn Oak Flat into a massive hole in the ground.”

— Justice Neil Gorsuch

Why this matters:

Oak Flat, with its oak groves and medicinal plants, holds spiritual and cultural significance for Apache peoples. The copper mine proposed by Resolution Copper threatens to permanently alter the landscape. likely collapsing it into a crater, and disrupt the delicate ecosystems and cultural traditions linked to the land. The fight over Oak Flat mirrors others across the United States where sacred Indigenous sites face industrial development, often justified by economic benefit but at the expense of cultural survival and environmental integrity. Copper mining also brings risks of groundwater contamination and long-term soil damage. With global demand for minerals increasing in the energy transition, these conflicts are becoming more frequent as legal protections for sacred and environmentally sensitive lands face growing pressure.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.

Toyota to Sell Seven EV Models in US, Send Surplus Cars Overseas Back to video

Article content

Production of two American-made all-electric models is slated to begin next year, joining three new imported EVs Toyota aims to have in US showrooms in the coming months and two currently available. By mid-2027, a total of seven EVs will be showing up in its US dealerships.

Article content

Article content

The new battery-powered cars will help fulfill the company’s pledge to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year. So far, just under 80% of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the US offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain.

Article content

Toyota typically doesn’t add a model to a plant unless it’s confident it can sell 100,000 to 150,000 units a year once production fully ramps up. Company executives say they expect slow but steady growth in US EV sales. At the same time, faster adoption in overseas markets offers an outlet for any US production in excess of domestic demand.

Article content

“We’ll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,” Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president in charge of planning and strategy at Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview. “But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the US will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.”

The state has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the electric vehicle industry over the last decade, according to records kept by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development.
Ford and GM did not respond to requests for comment on the potential rollback of consumer EV tax credits.","Congress may be poised to roll back electric vehicle tax credits and institute new annual taxes on electric vehicle owners — moves that could spell trouble for electric vehicle manufacturers in Tennessee and across the country, according to industry organizations.

The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a revised version of President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill last week. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” slashes multiple tax credits available to consumers who purchase new, used and commercial electric vehicles (EVs). It also creates a new annual tax for owners of EVs ($250) and hybrid vehicles ($100), money meant to make up for a lack of owners’ lack of gas tax contributions toward infrastructure upkeep.

The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration. Should it pass, the EV tax credits will expire on December 31, 2025, instead of the original December 2032 sunset date.

Industry advocates and analysts warn that axing the tax credits — which can save buyers up to $7,500 on new, American-made and sourced EVs — will kill the industry’s momentum in Tennessee and put investments and jobs at risk.

Tennessee has incentivized its growing electric vehicle industry with hundreds of millions of dollars of state contributions and tax breaks over the last decade. The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development estimates more than 20,000 Tennesseans are employed by companies with EV operations, and EV projects have injected $16.2 billion in capital into the state since 2017. In West Tennessee, BlueOval City’s EV assembly line for Ford’s new electric truck is still under construction, and BlueOval SK is gearing up for battery production. The massive $5.6 billion campus is expected to reshape and reinvigorate rural West Tennessee.

The Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group advocating for electric vehicle adoption and supportive public policy, called the move a “sledgehammer to Tennessee’s EV industry” in a statement published Tuesday.

EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

“It would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Electrification Coalition Executive Director Ben Prochazka stated. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting Tennessee jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

Reached by email, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development declined to comment on industry organizations’ concerns.

What does this mean for Tennessee auto manufacturing?

Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry has grown over the last two decades to include manufacturing plants for Ford, Volkswagen and GM, in addition to multiple companies that produce EV batteries or EV battery components.

Nissan also assembled its all-electric Nissan LEAF at its plant in Smyrna until recently. The 2026 LEAF will be assembled at the company’s Tochigi Plant in Japan, according to a company spokesperson, meaning the company no longer assembles any EVs or hybrid vehicles in Tennessee.

The state has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the electric vehicle industry over the last decade, according to records kept by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development. This includes a $78 million grant for the recruitment of Ultium Cells LLC, an EV battery manufacturer, to locate jobs for 1,300 workers in Maury County.

State lawmakers approved a $900 million incentive package for Ford’s BlueOval City campus in 2021, including $500 million in reimbursements for construction work on the campus in Stanton, Tennessee.

Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

While Tennessee’s growth in the industry predates tax incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden to support the production of batteries and battery components in the U.S., those incentives helped companies stand up more cost-competitive electric vehicle plants in the U.S., Harrison Godfrey, managing director of clean energy industry association Advanced Energy United, told Tennessee Lookout in November.

An October Washington Post analysis found Tennessee received an estimated $12.6 billion in investments in clean energy projects since the IRA passed in 2022.

Ford and GM did not respond to requests for comment on the potential rollback of consumer EV tax credits. But the Alliance for Automotive Innovation — an industry group with members from 42 U.S. automotive companies including GM, Ford, Nissan and Volkswagen — listed support for electric vehicle manufacturing among its 2025 policy priorities.

The organization specifically stated that policymakers should maintain both production tax credits for vehicle manufacturers and “consumer incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles.”

The Nissan spokesperson stated the company’s position on EV tax credits aligns with the policy priorities of Autos Drive America, a trade association representing international automakers in the U.S., including Nissan. Autos Drive America has worked to increase the number of electric vehicles that qualify for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit since the IRA’s passage in 2022.

The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment.

Budget politics

In April, Gov. Bill Lee celebrated the latest EV-related business expansion in Tennessee: a $54 million investment from automotive supplier Avancez in assembly operations at the BlueOval City Supplier Park.

A spokesperson for Lee did not respond to a request for comment on how EV tax credit rollbacks may impact Tennessee’s continued industry growth.

Lee voiced his support for the budget bill in a post on X on May 21, saying it will “secure the border, unleash American energy & deliver tax cuts — all measures that guarantee opportunity, security & freedom for the American people.”

The Electrification Coalition urged U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty to “take a more balanced approach” and preserve the tax credits to ensure the U.S. does not fall “further behind” in the global EV market.

Blackburn and Hagerty did not respond to requests for comment.

All of Tennessee’s U.S. Representatives voted in favor of the budget reconciliation bill, except for U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat based in Memphis. The bill passed in the House 215-214. All Democratic representatives voted against the bill.

Cohen could not be reached for comment by press time. U.S. Republican Reps. DesJarlais, Fleischmann, Green, Harshbarger, Kustoff, Ogles and Rose did not respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican representing East Tennessee, said in an emailed statement to Tennessee Lookout that he voted in favor of the bill due to national debt concerns.

“Our nation is currently $36 trillion in debt,” Burchett stated. “This bill rolls back Biden’s Green New Deal tax credits that we don’t have the money to pay for. I believe in an all-of-the-above energy approach, but we shouldn’t plunge our country deeper in debt as a result.”

Burchett also stated that the new tax for EV and hybrid owners “makes sure all drivers contribute towards our nation’s infrastructure,” as “electric vehicle owners don’t pay a gas tax which is used to fund vital highway projects.”

The Electrification Coalition and Nissan both expressed support for EV and hybrid drivers paying their “fair share” toward infrastructure, but the new tax level is more punitive than practical.

“We believe the new annual tax should be more in line with the gas tax equivalent ($150) rather than being set at a level that seems punitive,” the Nissan spokesperson stated.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka, of the Electrification Coalition, stated. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-97/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ford-blue-oval-city-1024x6501748513065.jpeg?h=16f2671a&itok=7h7XO2YT,N,,2025-05-29 08:01:54.290605

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition . E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week's House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president's desk.

What has been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county's position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden's environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement , rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives , reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action , blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping .

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi's energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2's tally.

Mary Barra, GM's chair and CEO, said it was the largest single investment GM has ever made in an engine plant.
These vehicles, these trucks – they’re some of the highest quality vehicles GM has.” Jensen said the project brings with it long-term viability for the Tonawanda plant.
U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said the Tonawanda plant and its workforce have proven their staying power with investments such as this one.
Even if the automakers make their electric vehicles in the United States, a lot of their supply chain is offshore, he said.","General Motors’ planned $888 million investment in its Town of Tonawanda engine plant reflects the automaker’s emphasis on current demand for vehicles over what might be to come.

The newly announced investment to make the next generation of V-8 engines for full-size trucks and SUVs takes the place of the $300 million commitment that GM made in 2023 to make drive units for electric vehicles at the site.

That EV production hasn’t been launched, but at the time it was announced, it was viewed as a key step for keeping the engine plant viable as electric vehicles gained a bigger share of the U.S. auto market.

Now, the $888 million will go toward equipping the plant to make a sixth generation of its V-8 engines, for gasoline-powered full-size trucks and SUVs. GM called it the single-largest investment it has ever made in one of its engine plants.

The shift also reflects GM’s push toward meeting ongoing demand for vehicles with internal combustion engines. While GM still has a goal of selling an all-electric fleet starting in 2035, Mary Barra, the company’s chair and CEO, has acknowledged the need to stay attuned to customers’ buying preferences today.

GM’s investment announcement also comes amid an altered political climate at the federal level this year. The Trump administration has aggressively pushed to bolster domestic manufacturing and scrapped the Biden administration’s target that electric vehicles account for 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2035.

Barra in a statement said GM’s investment at the Tonawanda site demonstrates the automaker’s “commitment to strengthening American manufacturing and supporting jobs in the U.S.”

Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations in Buffalo, said the GM Tonawanda announcement is “good politically for General Motors, saying ‘See, we want to build them in the U.S., and we don’t have to have this production elsewhere.’”

“I think the timing works out well,” Wheaton said. “It sounds like a lot of money, but a billion dollars for political goodwill is probably worth it for Mary Barra.”

For the Tonawanda plant’s 870 workers, the new investment protects jobs and gives the 87-year-old complex new production to keep the site viable as older products are phased out.

“It means it’s going to lengthen the amount of time they want to keep (the plant) there,” Wheaton said. “You wouldn’t make the biggest investment (in a GM engine plant) if you were going to turn around and close it right away.”

GM said the Tonawanda plant will continue making the fifth generation of its V-8 engine until production of the next generation of engines begins, in 2027. If past timelines hold up, that new engine could be produced for a decade or more.

“It’s all good news from the workers’ perspective, having that big chunk of money put into the plant,” Wheaton said.

Mary Barra, GM's chair and CEO, said it was the largest single investment GM has ever made in an engine plant.

Mike Grimmer, shop chairman of United Auto Workers Local 774, said in a video posted online that this was the first new engine program awarded to the plant in nearly 15 years and gives the workforce “job security for many years to come.”

Ray Jensen Jr., assistant director of Amherst-based UAW Region 9, said the investment connects the plant and its workforce to hot-selling GM vehicles.

“We see the profits GM is making quarter over quarter, year over year,” he said. “The demand for internal combustion engines is there. These vehicles, these trucks – they’re some of the highest quality vehicles GM has.”

Jensen said the project brings with it long-term viability for the Tonawanda plant. “It’s triple the investment and it’s going to at least keep the jobs that are there, and we’re hopeful it will create new jobs, as well.”

GM has not announced any new jobs tied to the $888 million investment. But Gov. Kathy Hochul said the investment will support the site’s employees, including 177 jobs “deemed at risk.” The state will provide up to $17 million in Excelsior Jobs program tax credits linked to the automaker’s investment.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said the Tonawanda plant and its workforce have proven their staying power with investments such as this one.

“If people doubted before, they should certainly have no doubts now that the future of America’s auto industry will be powered by engines made right here in Western New York, and Buffalo’s powerhouse UAW workforce will be fully involved,” he said.

Schumer said he has advocated for the plant through the years. “There is not a time when I talk to Mary Barra or any other previous CEO of GM when the word ‘Tonawanda’ was not coming from my lips repeatedly,” he said.

Schumer was asked about GM’s pivot away from an investment that would support electric vehicles toward a project to make internal combustion engines.

“Our No. 1 goal is jobs in Tonawanda,” he said. “I believe that electric cars still have a very good future. But getting ($888) million to redo this plant and keeping the workers working, and keeping the secondary suppliers supplying is No. 1, very important.”

GM’s electric vehicle sales in the first quarter rose 94% over a year ago, but they remain a small percentage of the automaker’s total sales.

Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst with Edmunds, said GM has done an effective job of creating an electric vehicle lineup that car buyers have asked for: electric-powered versions of vehicles they have driven for decades.

“They don’t want to see something super-futuristic,” he said. “They don’t want it to have a different name.”

But Yoon said from GM’s viewpoint, it makes sense to still make such a big investment in a new V-8 engine line.

“I think from a sales and profit perspective, V-8s are still their bread and butter,” he said. “It goes into all their trucks.

“I think it’s also a response to perhaps the difficult landscape that the automakers face with the current (presidential) administration toward electrification,” Yoon said.

Even if the automakers make their electric vehicles in the United States, a lot of their supply chain is offshore, he said. “It’s not easy to onshore them, especially within the timeframe of this current administration, and ramp up quickly.”

Yoon said he doesn’t believe any of the automakers intend to abandon their electrification projects, “but maybe ease off the pedal a little bit to see how the situation shakes out with this current administration.”

Peter Ahrens, executive director of the Buffalo Niagara Manufacturing Alliance, said GM’s investment was welcome news after local manufacturing shutdowns at facilities including Sumitomo Rubber USA and Oldcastle APG.

GM’s big investment is significant in light of the headwinds manufacturers face in New York State, such as the climate law and other regulations, Ahrens said.

GM’s manufacturing operations also are a boon to local vendors that supply its facilities, he said. “I’m hoping that (the new investment) bodes well that they increase their local supplier base.”

Wheaton noted the Tonawanda plant has a vast amount of space for production that is not being used.

“Having that ($888 million) investment to maintain it is great,” he said. “There’s plenty of room for expansion if they decide to go down that path in the future.”

The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a revised version of President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill last week. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” slashes multiple tax credits available to consumers who purchase new, used and commercial electric vehicles (EVs). It also creates a new annual tax for owners of EVs ($250) and hybrid vehicles ($100), money meant to make up for a lack of owners’ lack of gas tax contributions toward infrastructure upkeep.

The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration. Should it pass, the EV tax credits will expire on December 31, 2025, instead of the original December 2032 sunset date.

Industry advocates and analysts warn that axing the tax credits — which can save buyers up to $7,500 on new, American-made and sourced EVs — will kill the industry’s momentum in Tennessee and put investments and jobs at risk.

Tennessee has incentivized its growing electric vehicle industry with hundreds of millions of dollars of state contributions and tax breaks over the last decade. The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development estimates more than 20,000 Tennesseans are employed by companies with EV operations, and EV projects have injected $16.2 billion in capital into the state since 2017. In West Tennessee, BlueOval City’s EV assembly line for Ford’s new electric truck is still under construction, and BlueOval SK is gearing up for battery production. The massive $5.6 billion campus is expected to reshape and reinvigorate rural West Tennessee.

The Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group advocating for electric vehicle adoption and supportive public policy, called the move a “sledgehammer to Tennessee’s EV industry” in a statement published Tuesday.

EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

“It would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Electrification Coalition Executive Director Ben Prochazka stated. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting Tennessee jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

Reached by email, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development declined to comment on industry organizations’ concerns.

What does this mean for Tennessee auto manufacturing?

Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry has grown over the last two decades to include manufacturing plants for Ford, Volkswagen and GM, in addition to multiple companies that produce EV batteries or EV battery components.

Nissan also assembled its all-electric Nissan LEAF at its plant in Smyrna until recently. The 2026 LEAF will be assembled at the company’s Tochigi Plant in Japan, according to a company spokesperson, meaning the company no longer assembles any EVs or hybrid vehicles in Tennessee.

The state has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the electric vehicle industry over the last decade, according to records kept by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development. This includes a $78 million grant for the recruitment of Ultium Cells LLC, an EV battery manufacturer, to locate jobs for 1,300 workers in Maury County.

State lawmakers approved a $900 million incentive package for Ford’s BlueOval City campus in 2021, including $500 million in reimbursements for construction work on the campus in Stanton, Tennessee.

Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

While Tennessee’s growth in the industry predates tax incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden to support the production of batteries and battery components in the U.S., those incentives helped companies stand up more cost-competitive electric vehicle plants in the U.S., Harrison Godfrey, managing director of clean energy industry association Advanced Energy United, told Tennessee Lookout in November.

An October Washington Post analysis found Tennessee received an estimated $12.6 billion in investments in clean energy projects since the IRA passed in 2022.

Ford and GM did not respond to requests for comment on the potential rollback of consumer EV tax credits. But the Alliance for Automotive Innovation — an industry group with members from 42 U.S. automotive companies including GM, Ford, Nissan and Volkswagen — listed support for electric vehicle manufacturing among its 2025 policy priorities.

The organization specifically stated that policymakers should maintain both production tax credits for vehicle manufacturers and “consumer incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles.”

The Nissan spokesperson stated the company’s position on EV tax credits aligns with the policy priorities of Autos Drive America, a trade association representing international automakers in the U.S., including Nissan. Autos Drive America has worked to increase the number of electric vehicles that qualify for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit since the IRA’s passage in 2022.

The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment.

Budget politics

In April, Gov. Bill Lee celebrated the latest EV-related business expansion in Tennessee: a $54 million investment from automotive supplier Avancez in assembly operations at the BlueOval City Supplier Park.

A spokesperson for Lee did not respond to a request for comment on how EV tax credit rollbacks may impact Tennessee’s continued industry growth.

Lee voiced his support for the budget bill in a post on X on May 21, saying it will “secure the border, unleash American energy & deliver tax cuts — all measures that guarantee opportunity, security & freedom for the American people.”

The Electrification Coalition urged U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty to “take a more balanced approach” and preserve the tax credits to ensure the U.S. does not fall “further behind” in the global EV market.

Blackburn and Hagerty did not respond to requests for comment.

All of Tennessee’s U.S. Representatives voted in favor of the budget reconciliation bill, except for U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat based in Memphis. The bill passed in the House 215-214. All Democratic representatives voted against the bill.

Cohen could not be reached for comment by press time. U.S. Republican Reps. DesJarlais, Fleischmann, Green, Harshbarger, Kustoff, Ogles and Rose did not respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican representing East Tennessee, said in an emailed statement to Tennessee Lookout that he voted in favor of the bill due to national debt concerns.

“Our nation is currently $36 trillion in debt,” Burchett stated. “This bill rolls back Biden’s Green New Deal tax credits that we don’t have the money to pay for. I believe in an all-of-the-above energy approach, but we shouldn’t plunge our country deeper in debt as a result.”

Burchett also stated that the new tax for EV and hybrid owners “makes sure all drivers contribute towards our nation’s infrastructure,” as “electric vehicle owners don’t pay a gas tax which is used to fund vital highway projects.”

The Electrification Coalition and Nissan both expressed support for EV and hybrid drivers paying their “fair share” toward infrastructure, but the new tax level is more punitive than practical.

“We believe the new annual tax should be more in line with the gas tax equivalent ($150) rather than being set at a level that seems punitive,” the Nissan spokesperson stated.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka, of the Electrification Coalition, stated. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ford-Blue-Oval-City-2048x1300.jpeg,N,,2025-05-29 09:12:37.566104

The power(s) of state AGs

No one understands the power of state AGs better than Trump. Why else would the Department of Justice seek to preempt a state’s right to sue oil companies for the damages it knowingly causes to the environment through the emission of greenhouse gases on much the same grounds that state AGs – Republican and Democrat – were successful in suing cigarette companies in the 1990s?

Why else, too, would the president attack white shoe law firms that often take on these sorts of challenges to congressional or presidential overreach on a pro bono basis? State attorneys general are much harder to intimidate, given that their bottom line is the health and welfare of their state’s citizens, not annual revenues.

The use of litigation by AGs “as a policymaking tool gained prominence in the mid-1990s, when over 40 states—Republican and Democrat—initiated lawsuits against the tobacco industry. It ultimately resulted in a national settlement that included strict federal regulations on tobacco labeling and marketing, as well as financial relief for states.” Since that time, AGs have successfully “changed the rules of the game for banks, brokerage firms, and pharmaceutical companies, along with countless other industries.”

“If you think a congressman is more important than [an] attorney general, you’re wrong. The only hope you have of getting something done [as a member of the Congress] is if you stay four or five terms.”· James Tierney, former Maine AG

State AGs are part of the executive branch and popularly elected in forty-three states, while the governors of Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wyoming appoint their state’s attorney general. Maine’s legislature selects its state attorney general. In Tennessee, it’s up to the state supreme court to choose the AG.

According to the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG):

“The structure of the office and the duties of the attorney general vary … and are defined in state constitutions, statutes, and court decisions in different degrees of detail and emphasis, although the individual functions and priorities of each AG’s office vary by jurisdiction, there are a set of core tasks undertaken by the chief legal advisors in every state.

State AGs act as the public’s advocates in child support enforcement, labor relations, consumer protections, antitrust, and utility regulation. They propose legislation and enforce federal and state environmental laws and regulations.

The independence of state AGs

Although part of the executive branch, AGs can be independent actors. In April, Pennsylvania was joined by 22 other states and the District of Columbia in challenging the Trump administration’s abrupt cancellation of more than a half billion dollars in public health grants for Pennsylvanians for various services, e.g., immunizations and eldercare. Governor Shapiro appears on the plaintiff’s list on behalf of the Commonwealth rather than Pennsylvania’s AG, David Sunday, who is a Republican wanting to take a “less aggressive” approach toward President Trump” than his Democratic governor.

“Disputes between governors and attorneys general are fairly common and usually occur along partisan lines.” In 2017, then Kentucky Attorney General (D) sued his Republican governor over an executive order on the structure and membership of three existing state educational boards.

The same year, Maine’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, sued the state’s Democratic Attorney General, Janet Mills. The issue in this case was Mills “allegedly obstructing his ability to participate in a lawsuit supporting President Donald Trump’s (R) March 6, 2017 executive order impacting refugee admissions and immigrant and nonimmigrant travel.

“There’s an old joke about the National Association of Attorneys General—their registered name should be the National Association of Aspiring Governors.”· Larry J Sabato, The Center for Politics

Often, the AG’s office is a stepping stone to bigger things. Jeff Sessions (R) became a US senator from Alabama and was appointed as Trump’s first Attorney General. Scott Pruitt went from joining with and leading legal assaults on environmental regulations to becoming Trump’s first EPA administrator—responsible for drafting and defending federal environmental policies.

State AGs have become president, vice president, and chief justice of the Supreme Court. With some regularity, state AGs move from the courtroom to the governor’s mansion. Supporting AG candidates is an investment that keeps paying off. They take their environmental positions with them as they move up the political line.

The most litigated administration in US history

Even before President Trump took the oath of office for the second time, Democratic state attorneys general were standing at the courthouse door with dozens of petitions “asking judges to overturn executive actions. The dozens have since turned into a deluge on matters ranging from immigration, the environment, tariffs, guns, and the power to re-write the US Constitution.

The rise in AG activism is part and parcel of these profoundly partisan times. As much a consequence as a contributing factor to today’s culture wars, their involvement is intended as a foil to presidential policymaking through executive orders.

Following the election of George W. Bush, a partisan pattern of multistate lawsuits challenging the policy actions of opposition presidents in the courts began to emerge. Over his two terms, the Bush administration was sued 76 times. Of those, 38 were led by Democratic AGs. The Obama administration encountered 80 multistate legal challenges — 58 were Republican-led.

In Trump’s first four years, the number of coordinated multistate suits by Democratic AGs burgeoned to 160. The upward trend continued through President Biden’s term when Republican AGs sought intervention by the courts on 60 occasions. The number of times Trump and his second administration is challenged in court is likely to records—given the depth and breadth of his promised deconstruction of the federal establishment.

State AGs on both sides of the aisle have enviable success rates when suing opposition presidents. The overall win rates were 75.8 percent during the Biden administration, 83 percent in contests between Democratic AGs and the Trump administration, and 63.5 percent during Obama’s two terms.

As of May 21, 2025, the Trump administration has been sued nearly 250 times since taking office. The number grows daily, and so do the administration’s losses in court. During its first term, many of the administration’s losses in court were based on its failure to follow the Administrative Procedures Act, which controls much of how the executive branch goes about its business.

Hundreds of lawsuits – many brought by Democratic AGs – have been filed in the first four months of Trump 2.0. Before it’s over, thousands more will be. (There are excellent trackers that follow all the lawsuits and are regularly updated. These include the New York Times,Lawfare, and AP News.)

Trump has enacted his agenda at breakneck speed as part of an intentional plan to knock his opponents off balance and dilute their response.

In the final analysis, there are no more important elections in 2026 from an environmental perspective than the 30 state AGs running for office.

This move is in line with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. Countries around the world are increasingly shifting from coal-based energy to cleaner alternatives like solar, wind, and green hydrogen.

The Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy have been directed to work on this policy. According to officials, necessary changes will be made to implement this plan effectively.

It is expected that the policy will be rolled out soon and will help reduce carbon emissions from factories and industries.

Currently, India has a total power generation capacity of 4.70 lakh megawatts. Out of this, 2.14 lakh megawatts come from renewable energy sources, while the rest is generated using conventional sources like coal and gas. Industrial power consumption accounts for 42 per cent of the country’s total electricity usage.

By 2025, industrial electricity consumption is expected to rise to 2.35 lakh megawatts. To meet this future demand, around 1.10 lakh megawatts of power would need to come from renewable energy sources.

The policy aims to shift all new industrial power demand to green sources. This includes energy from solar, wind, biomass, and green hydrogen.

Officials also noted that this change will not only help reduce pollution but also attract more foreign investment in India’s renewable energy sector.

With a target to increase the share of clean energy, the government is focusing on making India a leader in green manufacturing, which could also create new employment opportunities and boost sustainable growth.",https://knnindia.co.in/uploads/newsfiles/REN-Energy-1-3-202411.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 06:05:42.129094

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated in a May 14 release announcing the changes.
""The EPA is pulling the rug out from communities that have already waited decades for protection and for clean drinking water.""
The nonprofit, non-partisan environmental group has estimated that there could be up to 30,000 polluters dumping PFAS into the environment, including into many water sources used for drinking water, across the country.
""When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean − allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.","The move has drawn criticism from environmental groups and activists, who argue it prioritizes industry over public health.

While federal action stalls, efforts to regulate PFAS are ongoing at the state level in North Carolina.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to delay the rollout of new regulations for some ""forever chemicals"" like GenX. The move comes as the Trump administration moves quickly to reduce the size and the regulatory scope of the EPA, an agency that many Republicans think is a shackle on businesses and impedes economic growth.

But the decision has hit many in the Cape Fear region hard, considering Southeastern North Carolina has been the epicenter of the national pollution crisis since the StarNews first reported in 2017 the presence of manmade chemicals in municipal drinking water systems and groundwater wells that couldn't be filtered out. Decades of uncontrolled dumping of the chemical compounds into the environment, including into waterways and groundwater that serve as drinking sources for millions, and their widespread use, including in fire-fighting foam, has seen contamination and health concerns from the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including GenX, proliferate across the country. The substances are often called forever chemicals because they do not easily break down in nature or the human body.

The resulting outrage set the stage for Michael Regan, then EPA administrator and North Carolina's former top environmental regulator, in April 2024 to announce in Fayetteville its first-ever drinking water standards to protect people against the toxic chemicals.

Spin forward a year and with a new administration in the White House, the application and efficiency of those proposed rules now seems murky.

What is the EPA now proposing?

The EPA in mid-May announced that it would uphold standards announced by the Biden administration last year for two manmade chemicals, but re-evaluate rules − including at what levels PFAS producers can safely release the contaminants into the environment − for four others, including GenX, the substance produced at the Chemours' Fayetteville Works plant about 75 miles upstream from Wilmington.

The new proposal also gives utilities an extra two years, until 2031, to comply with the federal standards to reduce the amount of manmade chemicals in their water supplies to what are considered levels safe for human consumption.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated in a May 14 release announcing the changes. ""At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.""

The Trump administration's move received support from some industry groups like the American Chemistry Council, which had questioned the science the Biden administration had used to make the initial rules and the costs it could impose on local communities and utilities.

“The question is not whether to regulate specific substances but how to best do so in a manner that is consistent with the state of the science and focuses on the most pressing drinking water priorities for local communities,"" the group said in a release. “We will continue working with EPA and other policymakers on strong, science-based regulations that protect our health and environment while supporting the needs of local water systems.”

How have the proposed changes been received?

Clean water activists and environmentalists see the changes as another giveaway by the Trump administration to its business backers, in this case the chemical industry, and an attempt to shift the burden of PFAS contamination, needed clean-up efforts, and current and future health risks from industry to local utilities and the general public.

""The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it’s sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come,"" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, in a release. ""The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases.

""The EPA is pulling the rug out from communities that have already waited decades for protection and for clean drinking water.""

The nonprofit, non-partisan environmental group has estimated that there could be up to 30,000 polluters dumping PFAS into the environment, including into many water sources used for drinking water, across the country. In the Wilmington area, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority and H2GO, which serves customers in Brunswick County, have spent millions installing filters and other upgrades to remove PFAS from their water supplies − costs that the utilities have had to pass on to ratepayers.

Kelly Moser is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has helped many North Carolina groups, residents and municipalities go after the businesses that have polluted their water supplies.

""When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean − allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.

What happens now?

While more stringent PFAS requirements appear to be stuck in mud at the federal level, activists are still hopeful they can be expanded through action in Raleigh. Federal standards are generally considered the bare minimum state's need to comply with and do not limit more stringent rules being adopted by state regulators, something California has done numerous times when it comes to environmental concerns.

But N.C.'s Environmental Management Commission, which develops the state's environmental regulations, has been slow-footing a push by first Gov. Roy Cooper's and now Gov. Josh Stein's administration to adopt new rules regarding maximum discharge limits for PFAS and 1,4 dioxane, another worrisome carcinogen that's been found in the Cape Fear River.

Action by the N.C. General Assembly to address the contaminants is another option, with state Sen. Michael Lee, R-New Hanover and the Senate majority leader, sponsoring the ""Water Safety Act"" that would force the state to adopt safe drinking water standards and discharge limits for major PFAS dischargers and users. It also would include funds to reimburse public utilities for their costs in filtering out the forever chemicals.

State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., R-New Hanover, also has sponsored a bill in the House that would hold companies that make PFAS from scratch, like Chemours, responsible to pay for upgrades implemented by public water utilities to filter out the manmade compounds.

South-South cooperation refers to the concerted efforts to collaborate among developing nations across these areas to meet global goals, and promotes knowledge sharing and technology transfer.

The forum was held under the Chatham House Rule which prohibits the direct attribution of sources.

The delegation from Ghana shared how they were making progress on the implementation of a carbon market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and how they have managed to capitalise on opportunities with partners. They are currently running 12 projects, with eight million tonnes of carbon credits and 5,000 green jobs created as a result.

The country is generating carbon credits from avoided emissions, which they can sell on the international market, with existing international buyers including Switzerland, Sweden and Singapore. They have benefited from learning from peers in Kenya and Senegal and proposed South-South cooperation within the Commonwealth to advance progress. This proposal was accepted by the Commonwealth Secretariat and will be developed by the Commonwealth Sustainable Energy Transitions Agenda team.

Dan Dorner, Head of the Strategic Initiatives Office at the International Energy Agency, said on the sidelines of the forum that globally, large, long-term investment is needed, but geopolitical and economic uncertainty can cause hesitation when it comes to taking those actions. He added:

“One of the most exciting aspects when it comes to the Commonwealth is the fact that it brings together such a large and diverse number of countries from around the world and can really share experience, knowledge and best practice to ensure that those leading in the transitions and learning from the transitions can then share with others and help them move more quickly to achieve the goals and aspirations that they want to.”

Louise Hangero is a Senior Petroleum Inspector at the Namibian Ministry of Industries, Mining and Energy. On the second day, she chaired a session on clean energy and innovation. By having clean energy, a country can generate carbon credits. She said on the sidelines of the event:

“If we wanted to add more renewables into our space, we would have to reconfigure our grid to be able to accommodate the energy from the renewables and, as it is, our energy access is not optimal. We need to deal with access before we can fully deal with an energy transition.""

On the closing day, delegates talked about the complexities of and challenges with carbon pricing and carbon tax. There was also discussion on how they can disproportionately affect people on the lower income scales. Suggestions from the floor were around ensuring such taxes are comprehensive to avoid the “leaky bucket” problem where industries relocate to areas with less stringent carbon pricing and compensation to cushion the tax burden on low-income households.

Further suggestions included ringfencing, exploring both benefits and challenges, recycling of carbon tax revenues, and promoting the sharing of experiences from how other countries in the Commonwealth are implementing their country-specific carbon-pricing models.

The Commonwealth Secretariat will reconvene the CSET forum in 2027.

Oklo and Centrus in the news

Yesterday, Oklo said it will collaborate with its Korean partner to advance the technology of its new Aurora powerhouse, as well as Korea Hydro's own ""innovative domestic advanced nuclear technology, the i-SMR."" The announcement seems to have caught the attention of investment bank William Blair, which initiated coverage of Oklo stock today with an ""outperform"" rating.

Oklo plans to build a 75-megawatt Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory site, and says it has another 14 gigawatts of nuclear power plants lined up after that, in its ""growing order pipeline."" Blair says the company has laid out ""a fast-tracked regulatory pathway called a custom combined construction and operating license approval (COLA)"" that ""will permit Oklo to capture upside from rising electricity prices, especially from premium clean energy PPAs,"" as StreetInsider.com reports today.

The analyst also likes Oklo's vertically integrated business model, in which the company intends to not only design but also build, own, and operate its own nuclear power plants.

Blair also likes Centrus Energy, but for different reasons. In today's note, the banker pointed out that Centrus currently holds one of only two Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses that have been issued for low-enriched uranium (LEU). Centrus holds the only NRC license issued for enriching uranium to high levels, turning it into what is called ""high-assay low-enriched uranium,"" or ""HALEU.""

This places Centrus in a prime position to benefit from U.S. government policy to decrease reliance on Russia to sell us enriched uranium for use in U.S. nuclear power plants. And Blair places a value of about $15 billion on this market -- which Centrus apparently owns 50% to 100% of!

Which nuclear power stock should you buy?

Blair values Oklo stock at $70 per share, versus the $55 and change that the stock costs today. The prospect of a 27% profit may tempt investors, but beware: Oklo remains in start-up mode, has no revenue coming in, and isn't expected to begin generating revenue before 2027. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence don't expect to see profitability before 2029.

And Centrus?

Blair has a $185 fair valuation on Centrus stock, implying that one could go up as much as 45%. What's more, Centrus is already more of a going concern, with $471 million in revenue collected over the last 12 months, and a very respectable $106 million profit.

At $2.2 billion in market capitalization currently, the stock only costs about 20 times earnings. With a big Trump tailwind at its back, Centrus stock could be a winner.

And what about AES?

What about AES stock, today's big loser?

AES has been in a downtrend since reporting a sizable earnings miss early in the month. (AES was supposed to earn $0.34 per share in Q1, but reported only a $0.27 adjusted profit). The Fly points out that the company's guidance for the rest of this year looked weak as well. And just yesterday, Argus Research analyst John Eade downgraded AES stock to ""hold,"" warning of a ""strained"" balance sheet and growth prospects that don't get out of the mid-single digits this year.

That may not sound exciting to momentum traders swept up in the nuclear wave this week. But AES stock has a lot to recommend itself to value and dividend investors. Its $7.2 billion market cap and $1.3 billion in trailing earnings mean the stock costs barely 5.5 times trailing earnings, and AES pays a generous dividend yield of nearly 7%.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/819799/mother-and-son-hold-hands-in-a-field-of-flowers-outside-a-nuclear-power-station.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 09:13:41.336611

A new report shows that businesses canceled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in renewable energy and clean vehicle factories since January. These cancelations come amid rising fears over the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy, according to E2’s latest analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and Atlas Public Policy.

In April alone, companies canceled a record $4.5 billion in investments in new battery, electric vehicle and wind projects in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits. An additional $1.5 billion in newly found canceled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.

As the Senate prepares to take up the legislation, E2’s analysis shows that more than 10,000 announced jobs have already been canceled amid concerns over the advance of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2. “If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are canceled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancelations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been canceled in Republican districts so far.

Through April, more than 61% of all clean energy projects announced — along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments — are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

While cancelations continue to rise, companies are still investing in the potential of the U.S. clean economy. Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states — including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.

April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been canceled, closed or downsized. Nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

A full map and list of announcements is available at e2.org/announcements/. Cancelation data will be incorporated in the coming months.

While government documents about projects like Avenida Liberdade are made available to the public, they are light on details.","Avenida Liberdade (“Freedom Avenue”) took one of its first victims months before its planned completion.

A construction worker was using a tractor to fell trees just outside Belém, a major metropolitan area in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, to make way for the new expressway when the machine ran over an armadillo. The ground-dwelling mammal’s camouflaging, tile-shaped bony plates and ability to curl into a tight ball offer it protection from the jaguars, maned wolves, and crocodiles that usually cross its path. But these defenses were no match for the heavy machinery churning up its habitat that day.

Once the high-speed highway is complete, vehicles traveling on it will bring a slew of new threats to the flora and fauna that call this 8.3-mile stretch of forest home. In November, Belém will host COP30, the United Nations’ annual global climate summit that will host some 50,000 to 60,000 world leaders, scientists, representatives of NGOs, and members of civil society over 12 days. The construction of this four-lane thoroughfare, complete with wide shoulders and bike lanes on either side, is meant to alleviate the already heavily congested traffic entering and exiting the city ahead of the upcoming international climate summit. It is among dozens of similar infrastructure projects in progress now.

“When these projects are in some way presented as being for COP30, it becomes very difficult for civil society—especially those who are most impacted by what’s happening—to question or oppose them.”

These projects have left experts and environmentalists perplexed and concerned. Hosting COP30 in the heart of a region whose protection is crucial to mitigating global climate change is an opportunity to create a legacy of conservation. Instead, the development preceding the event could cause more harm than good, leaving a trail of destruction in the world’s largest rainforest.

When the UN chose Belém to host COP30 in 2023, concerns from experts and local nonprofits related to its preparedness abounded. The city, located in the southeastern corner of the Amazon in the state of Pará, already struggles to provide its 1.3 million residents with basic necessities (more than 59 percent of the population does not have access to the city’s sewage system, according to Brazilian census agency IBGE). With six months to go before the event, the city is still so severely lacking in accommodations that some hotels have waitlists of 1,000 people per bed. The Federal Revenue Agency building, public schools, and cruise ships are being transformed into temporary lodgings.

In an attempt to improve conditions for visitors during COP30, at least 38 infrastructure projects in Belém have been planned specifically for the summit, including new lodging, improvements to the city’s sewage system, and expansions of some of its roadways. And experts are worried about as many as 60 additional projects happening in and around the Amazonian city. Several, like Avenida Liberdade, are not directly linked to the planning of COP30, but because of the upcoming event, officials gave them a boost in resources or, sometimes even more significantly, in importance.

“The COP ends up acting as a major catalyst for projects in the city, which is what is happening with Avenida Liberdade,” said Tiago Santos, a geographer at the Federal Institute of Pará (IFPA) and member of the COP30 Observatory, a group of some 40 researchers monitoring the environmental and social impacts of the megaevent. “When these projects are in some way presented as being for COP30, it becomes very difficult for civil society—especially those who are most impacted by what’s happening—to question or oppose them.”

Avenida Liberdade, Santos said, is one of the most environmentally concerning projects that officials are pushing to completion ahead of the climate summit, a worrying speed for such a large project, particularly because of the need to carefully study its potential effects on the environment and how to properly carry out mitigation methods. While plans for the road started in 2020, construction began in June 2024, and the governor of Pará, Helder Barbalho, has promised it will be ready by November.

The expressway will make its way through several municipalities, slicing through the Belém Metropolitan Environmental Protection Area (APA) along the way. The conservation unit is meant to protect biodiversity in an area just over 18,500 acres, while allowing limited, sustainable use of natural resources under specific rules laid out by the Pará state government.

According to the environmental impact study of Avenida Liberdade, the highway will cross the Murutucu and Aurá rivers, as well as the Pau Grande creek, all tributaries of the Guamá river in the APA. It will also run about 500 yards from the Utinga State Park, which alone is home to roughly 151 plant and 330 animal species. For the fauna in the area, that could mean collisions with vehicles. It’s a problem on high-speed roadways across Brazil, including the BR-262—also known as the Highway of Death—which registers 3,000 animal deaths a year.

Pará’s state secretary of infrastructure and logistics, Adler Silveira, said just two months after construction of the road started last year that Avenida Liberdade would be “completely fenced in to protect the native vegetation, maintaining the preservation of the surrounding ecosystem, preventing users from accessing regions bordering the highway.”

But isolating sections of the forest like this can modify the border of where it grows, making it harder for flora, and the fauna that depend on it, to survive. Another concern not listed in the environmental impact study is the new highway’s proximity to the Federal Rural University of Amazônia (UFRA). Clearing for the portion of the highway that will run some 100 feet behind the UFRA campus took off early this year, causing concern for employees like Ana Sílvia Ribeiro, who teaches veterinary medicine and treats animals at the public institution’s Wildlife Triage and Rehabilitation Center.

Ribeiro remembers five pregnant sloths being transferred to other areas of the forest when the trees they were living in were set to come down to make way for the highway. Many of the animals treated at the rehab center—mammals, birds, reptiles, and aquatic species among them—are released back into the wild once they’ve recovered from their injuries, but the presence of the construction site has already made Ribeiro and her colleagues rethink reintroducing them into the rainforest in areas that they once considered safe.

For now, releases near the university have been suspended. Ribeiro and her colleagues now rely on the government’s environmental agents to pick up the rehabilitated animals and release them in sometimes distant areas of the rainforest, depending on the environmental and ecosystem needs of the species.

The soon-to-be-inaugurated expressway has also led the veterinary team to worry that the rehab center will receive more injured patients due to collisions with vehicles. Experts say one of the best ways to keep animals off roads are aerial, terrestrial, and arboreal fauna passages. These are built with the specifications of each region’s wildlife in mind and use strategically placed fencing that can’t be broken, climbed over, or dug under to guide animals for safe crossing. (Silveira, who did not respond to requests for comment, had previously said there would be 34 fauna passages along Avenida Liberdade, but provided no specifics about them.)

Fernanda Abra, a biologist specializing in the ecology of roads and a cofounder of environmental consultancy firm ViaFauna, said that while collisions are a major concern when it comes to roads and animals, so is the fragmentation of their habitats, which can leave them without access to areas necessary to hunt, forage, and breed.

“When individuals of a species stop crossing the area where a highway is built, we see a fragmentation effect and population isolation,” Abra said. “It’s especially a problem with animals that are strictly arboreal, like howler monkeys and spider monkeys, which need connection at the forest-canopy level to move around.”

Avenida Liberdade will run about 500 yards from the Utinga State Park, which alone is home to roughly 151 plant and 330 animal species.

Since construction of Avenida Liberdade began, Ribeiro has already noticed some strange movements from the animal populations living around UFRA, including monkeys, coati, and armadillos—like the one killed by the tree-felling tractor.

“It’s something we shouldn’t be seeing and that we’ll have to monitor closely,” she said. “The armadillos should be deeper in the forest, but they’ve moved to its border and are more exposed.”

That visibility could also make armadillos more vulnerable to poachers and traffickers who are already roaming the region in search of sought-after species, many of which are endangered.

For Ribeiro, the crux of the issue, and what has led to this series of trickle-down worries, is a lack of transparency. While government documents about projects like Avenida Liberdade are made available to the public, they are light on details. “We knew trees would be cleared for construction of the road, but not when the process would start and stop,” she said. And there has been no opportunity for dialogue in order to better understand them.

“We know Belém needs to be expanded and needs to be updated, but not like this,” said Ribeiro. “Why not take the time to talk with the people who work with the forest every day? We could find a better way, and one that takes less of a toll. Because no matter what, we know there will be impacts.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-29 10:21:02.783332

These projects, currently under construction, will collectively add 265MW of new energy for Indiana and are part of Arevon’s expansion in the Midwest/Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) territories.

The 192MWdc Ratts 1 Solar has secured a long-term power purchase agreement with the Indiana Municipal Power Agency, while Meta will be the offtaker for 73MWdc Heirloom Solar.

Both projects are expected to commence operations in the second half of 2025.

The partnership with Fifth Third Bank leverages the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit transfer provision, offering Arevon enhanced capital structure flexibility.

Fifth Third Bank Head of Renewables Jon Stark stated: “Supporting premier platforms like Arevon squarely fits our future growth, and we look forward to continuing to grow our relationship with Arevon as they continue to execute on their high-quality US renewables pipeline.”

The Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects represent a nearly $400m investment and are projected to contribute more than $86m to local governments, benefiting public services and infrastructure.

The construction has created 200 full-time jobs and boosted local businesses.

Arevon chief investment officer Denise Tait stated: “The complex and highly successful structure of this transaction marks another notable financial accomplishment for Arevon. This is a great example of what happens when all the right pieces come together.

“We were proud to work with Fifth Third Bank and our other financing partners on all we have achieved across our projects’ financing packages. The Arevon team’s deep expertise and experience will enable us to continue to innovate on future financial transactions.”

Advisory and legal firms Paragon Energy Capital, Latham & Watkins, and Norton Rose Fulbright played key roles in closing the latest tax equity commitment.

President Trump, in celebrating last week’s narrow passage of his “big, beautiful bill” by the House, called it “arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.”

Trump’s social media post was on-brand in terms of its hyperbole, yet — if not significantly altered by the Senate — Trump’s exaggeration could prove accurate; just not in the sense of outcomes most Americans will want to live with.

Much of the concern regarding the 1,100-page bill — meant to extend the tax-cut package adopted in 2017, the last time Republicans had unified control of the legislative and executive branches — has focused correctly on how the continuation and expansion of those tax cuts will be “paid for” in terms of the elimination of benefits for millions enrolled in Medicaid and Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), the expiration of Obamacare subsidies and the saddling of future generations with the addition of between $3 trillion to $5 trillion over the next 10 years to the national debt, which now stands at $36.9 trillion.

As significant as those looming outcomes are, the legislation also has taken aim at work accomplished by the Biden administration and Congress in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act to address the climate crisis and begin the transition to a clean energy economy, which was already delivering benefits; in the form of new jobs, lower energy costs and hopes for reduction of climate-warming greenhouse gases and pollution, especially in communities and states that had voted for President Trump in 2017 and 2024.

The bill repeals or speeds the sunsets of clean energy tax credits — $522 billion that Congress had promised the local communities across the country — ending incentives for renewable energy, specifically wind, solar and battery storage projects and reneges on the largest investment in clean energy in history, while at the same time increasing tax incentives and subsidies for the fossil fuel industry.

Homeowners and vehicle owners considering solar panels and electric vehicles will see federal rebates and tax credits disappear. Along with the end of the $7,500 tax credit for EVs, a similar tax credit for home solar panels will be eliminated as will a credit for companies that lease solar panels to lower their initial cost to homeowners and businesses.

Hoping to win support of Republican congressional districts that could ensure the clean energy investments’ survival, the act made a point of delivering about three times the spending to Republican districts as it has to Democratic districts, even though not a single Republican voted for the IRA. A Washington Post analysis last year found that of the top 10 districts that had attracted the most clean energy investments, nine were represented by Republican lawmakers.

In Washington state, Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse’s Central Washington 4th District was allocated $323 million in such investments. Next door, Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier’s 8th District was to see just $2.6 million, while Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen’s 2nd District was promised $42 million in clean energy investments. The comparison is made not to bemoan that Democratic districts were denied their fair share of such investments; but to note that House Republicans’ allegiance to Trump and to the extension of tax cuts for those in upper income brackets appears to outweigh the promise of such benefits to the GOP’s own constituents, adding to the adverse economic impact for those Republican districts that depend on Medicaid and SNAP benefits.

The broader effect of the end of such investments could significantly slow progress on climate efforts, especially when added to other recent moves such as the Senate’s vote last week to revoke waivers that California, Washington and other states had relied upon to seek the phase-out of the sale of new gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035; and the Trump administration’s clawback of funds already allocated by Congress — $71 million for Washington state — for a network of electric vehicle charging stations.

The momentum of the clean energy transition, ultimately, may prove resilient. This year, solar, wind and battery storage projects are expected to account for 63 gigawatts — 93 percent — of new electric grid capacity, a 30 percent increase from the year prior, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But that’s growth that U.S. electrical grids need desperately as demand increases to meet the growth in computer servers for AI, as well as clean transportation and home energy, growth now threatened by the legislation. And its demand that construction of natural gas generating plants likely will not be able to satisfy because of increasing costs, material shortages and supply chain problems for such plants. Without continued investments in clean energy, the Center for American Progress reports that a pullback of clean energy projects could increase home electricity bills by $70 to $110 annually by 2030.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement, reported by Reuters.

Washington Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell are well on the record in opposition to the Republican legislation now before the Senate for consideration.

Washington residents, regardless of party alliance, should add their voices to remind Congress and president to represent their needs and interests by rejecting a transfer of wealth to the nation’s most affluent individuals and corporations from its its poorest families, its future generations and the climate’s health.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/39507924_web1_TSR-240425-edh-opi-RooftopSolar.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 09:12:47.751485

TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)’s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement without any upfront capital investment.

“This project is a testament to what’s possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,” said Anna Toenjes, associate VP of impact and business development at Sol Systems. “From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we’re proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.”

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL’s manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kWh of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA’s largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

“We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we’re taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,” said Kenji Sugito, TBIL president. “We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.”

Onyx Renewables completed the project’s final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

“This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,” said Patty Rollin, chief commercial officer at Onyx Renewables. “Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.”

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA’s own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an “energy community,” designated due to the area’s unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

“From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,” said Alyssa Martin, president of Nelnet Renewable Energy. “The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-29 08:19:46+00:00,Canary Media,Why the solar industry is counting Ohio's newest energy law as a win - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/ohio-law-power-generation-hb-15,"We need the energy,” said Michael Benson, board president of Green Energy Ohio, whose members include a variety of clean energy companies.
And the Ohio Power Siting Board will speed up its review of energy projects in those areas.
For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board.
Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories.
Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.","A new state law aimed at expanding gas and nuclear power plants in Ohio may also provide opportunities for solar developers — if they can overcome other policy and political barriers.

Solar industry advocates say House Bill 15, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in mid-May, contains several technology-neutral provisions that could benefit clean energy projects, including property tax breaks for siting them on brownfields and former coal mines. The law also loosens restrictions on behind-the-meter electricity generation and lowers the overall tax burden for new power plants.

“This is just smart economic development. We need the energy,” said Michael Benson, board president of Green Energy Ohio, whose members include a variety of clean energy companies. In his view, a market-based approach should work in favor of renewables and battery storage, which can generally be deployed more quickly and cheaply than power plants that burn fossil fuels.

Much of the public discussion around the legislation focused on its repeal of coal plant subsidies mandated by HB 6, the 2019 law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing public corruption scandal. HB 15 also will end the use of ​“electric security plans,” which let utilities add special charges to customer bills without reviewing all revenue and expenses in a full rate case.

But many of the measures in HB 15 are meant to encourage new electricity production in the state.

“We should open the market to dispatchable energy generation to address future energy shortages,” the bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Roy Klopfenstein (R-Haviland), said in his February testimony, in which he also noted growing energy demand from data centers and other large electricity users, and energy supply issues raised by grid operator PJM Interconnection. The term ​“dispatchable” is often used to refer to power plants that can be turned on or off as demand requires, as opposed to solar or wind without battery backup.

Most of the law’s incentives for new energy production are technology-neutral, however.

Under HB 15, new electricity production on brownfields and minelands designated as priority investment areas will be exempt from property taxes for five years. Grants of up to $10 million each will be available to clean up or prepare the sites for construction. And the Ohio Power Siting Board will speed up its review of energy projects in those areas.

“It’s a huge opportunity,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy in Ohio. Last year the organization estimated that Ohio has more than 600,000 acres of minelands and brownfields suitable for renewable energy production. The sites often have good access to roads and transmission lines, too.

As Mellino sees it, solar in priority areas would avoid objections raised by some people about displacing farmland. And counties with renewable energy bans could presumably modify them to allow development in priority investment areas without affecting other parts of their jurisdictions, she suggested.

The law also removes a restriction that has required behind-the-meter generation to be located on the premises of the customer who is using the power. The change might allow data centers to tap into gas-fired backup generators on an adjacent property, for example. But it could also create new opportunities for clean energy-powered microgrids, in which a group of customers share solar panels and a large battery.

“That is significant, all by itself,” because it provides more flexibility, said Dylan Borchers, an energy attorney with law firm Bricker Graydon in Columbus, Ohio. Just as importantly, the law ​“allows essentially a portfolio approach for customers and energy resources.”

In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared ​“self-power” system with equipment for electricity generation or battery storage on adjacent land or on premises controlled by one or more of them. Such a system could include numerous generation or storage facilities, allowing a cluster of data centers, factories, or other large energy users to combine multiple behind-the-meter resources, whether they be natural gas, solar, batteries, or small nuclear when it becomes available.

The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. ​“If you want the most power quickly and cleanly, you can use rooftops and parking lots and build out a lot of small-scale generation.”

The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.

Ohio’s current tangible personal property tax rates have been so high that companies have often used ​“payments in lieu of taxes,” also known as PILOT programs, to avoid getting walloped by huge tax bills as soon as energy production starts. But counties face somewhat strict requirements for how they must allocate PILOT payments. Developers that take advantage of the lower tax rates available under HB 15 may have more financial flexibility to be able to fund some projects that local governments want most, such as a new fire station or community center, Borchers said.

Taken together, the provisions in HB 15 promise to make it easier to build more solar in the state, industry representatives say.

The governor and legislature saw ​“the urgent need to expand energy generation as Ohio confronts rapidly increasing demand and the threat of escalating costs and supply shortages,” said Will Hinman, executive director for the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio. ​“House Bill 15 is a critical step towards addressing these challenges by reducing barriers to energy development — including utility-scale solar projects.”

Ohio is still not a level playing field for clean energy

The law still requires projects to meet multiple criteria to benefit from its provisions. For example, power-generating facilities and transmission lines exceeding certain thresholds may need approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board. The state’s director of development must approve local governments’ designations of priority investment areas. And self-power systems have to be independent of the main power grid.

The biggest downside is that the new law left in place a 2021 statute, Senate Bill 52, which requires utility-scale renewable energy developments to get local approval, said Molly Bryden, a climate and sustainability researcher with think tank Policy Matters Ohio.

Under that earlier law, 34 of Ohio’s 88 counties have banned new solar generation in all or part of their territories. Even where the local law doesn’t bar a new project, local officials can still block projects before a developer even seeks a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board. A county representative and a township representative also get to vote with state siting board members on whether facilities get a permit, even for some projects that were in the grid operator’s queue before the 2021 law.

Another law took effect in early 2023, letting local governments limit small solar and wind projects that connect to the grid but don’t otherwise fall within the scope of the 2021 law.

Requirements of the 2021 and 2023 laws don’t apply to generation fueled by natural gas, coal, or nuclear power. And Ohio’s high court has ruled local governments can’t ban or regulate gas wells and related infrastructure or even enforce broader zoning laws that would prevent such development.

Lawmakers also cut out provisions from an earlier version of HB 15 that would have allowed community solar development. Community solar lets residential customers save money by sharing the electricity from a local solar array, which doesn’t have to be on their own property.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-panels-in-a-field.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c32992994889c90fec92357fb7e6b769,N,,2025-05-29 10:20:34.912363

Current opportunities

The biofuel sector was once considered a niche space which had limited awareness and fewer opportunities available. However, the sector has been completely transformed over the last decade. The industry now offers lucrative opportunities for people with skill sets across engineering, supply chain, quality control and strategic roles around sustainability. From on-ground management to leadership roles, the biofuel sector will play a leading role in employment generation and in driving India’s green economy.

Building the green collar workforce

A report titled ‘World Energy Employment 2024’ published by the International Energy Agency indicates that biofuel jobs in India grew more than twice as fast as fossil fuel jobs. This is a clear indicator of the shift in the energy employment landscape in India and the country’s steadfast focus on clean energy.

While there is an increasing demand for a workforce, the lack of skilled talent continues to remain a challenge. As per a TeamLease report, India’s renewable energy sector has a skill gap of around 1.2 million people, and by 2027, India will need 1.7 million workers as the demand is expected to increase by 26%.

For India to realise its clean energy goals, it must be supported by a skilled workforce that caters to the growing needs of the sector.

What needs to be done?

Build training ecosystems: Since sectors such as CBG are still at their nascent stages, there is a lot of potential for introducing structured vocational training that can prepare workers of tomorrow with all the right skills. On-the-job training modules, certification programmes, technical training, and internship opportunities must be provided for youth interested in pursuing green careers.

Collaboration with colleges and universities: One of the key challenges currently is the lack of communication channels between academic institutions and the renewable energy sector. Not many universities and even students are aware of the remarkable opportunities that exist in clean energy sectors. If there is a bridge between academia and the industry, students can be aware of what the sector has to offer and the real-world skills required to excel in these jobs.

Need for public and private partnerships: A collaboration between the government and leading private players in the clean energy sector can play a defining role in meeting the rapidly growing demand for skilled workers. Introducing financial incentives to encourage private players to invest in training initiatives and offering apprenticeships can go a long way in building the right workforce for the sector. Additionally, it can also ensure that the skills being taught are aligned with real world job requirements.

While the focus remains on skilling the upcoming workforce, attention must be given to upskilling the existing workforce by ensuring they are updated with emerging technologies and skills required for the evolving clean energy sector.

Create a gender balance – can we get more women into the green workforce?

A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency indicates that globally only 32% of the workforce in renewable energy are women. This percentage will be far lower in India. If India has to reach its net zero goals, we need more women to be a part of the green workforce.

One of the challenges currently is the perception that biofuel jobs are for men. The gendered notion discourages many women from pursuing careers in the green energy sector. Very recently, our collaboration with Nimaya, a not-for-profit career accelerator for women in rural communities, was an example of how women can and are keen on taking on roles in the clean energy sector. In biofuel, there is a lot of scope for grassroots-level involvement with roles around feedstock collection, plant operations, managing logistics and supervisory roles.

We need to create an ecosystem that can provide women with immersive soft skills training, covering behavioural and workplace skills, digital proficiency, leadership development and placement support for career-building opportunities in the biofuel sector. By equipping women with the right skills, we are creating a future powered by a skilled and passionate workforce ready to drive the biofuel revolution forward.

Creating meaningful livelihoods

The biofuel sector is not only enabling a cleaner planet, but it’s also creating meaningful livelihoods for people. For India to achieve its net zero goals, we need to create a workforce that is skilled, inclusive and future-ready. Investing in building the right training infrastructure, focusing on creating gender balance in the workforce and ensuring awareness and easy access to biofuel jobs can be pivotal in India’s smooth transition to clean energy.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/05/29/Untitled-design-97.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 06:05:53.190562

The court, however, rejected Lliuya's claim against RWE, saying there was ""no concrete danger to his property"" from a potential flood.
- 10-year legal fight - RWE said in a statement it had ""always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law"".
The Essen court dismissed the case, but in 2017 the higher district court in nearby Hamm allowed an appeal.
The decision by the court in Hamm would ""a powerful precedent to support those efforts"", she said.","A German court on Wednesday rejected a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, but set a potentially important precedent on polluters' liability for their carbon emissions.

The judge in the case ruled that companies ""may be obligated to take preventive measures"" to counter their emissions, according to a statement from the higher regional court in Hamm.

""If the polluter definitively refuses to do so, it could be determined, even before actual costs are incurred, that the polluter must bear the costs in proportion to their share of the emissions,"" the court concluded.

The ruling supported arguments made by Saul Luciano Lliuya, who claimed that RWE, a global energy company headquartered in Germany, should pay towards the cost of protecting his hometown of Huaraz from a glacial lake swollen by melting snow and ice.

RWE has never operated in Peru, but the 44-year-old farmer argued that, as one of the world's top emitters of carbon dioxide, the firm was partly responsible for the flood risk.

The court, however, rejected Lliuya's claim against RWE, saying there was ""no concrete danger to his property"" from a potential flood.

Lliuya, who did not attend the presentation of the verdict in person, said in a statement he was ""disappointed"" the court had not overall ruled in his favour.

But speaking to journalists in a video call from his hometown, the farmer said he was ""very happy with the precedent"" set by the ruling.

Lliuya's lawyer Roda Verheyen said the court's reasoning showed ""that large emitters can be held responsible for the consequences of their greenhouse gas emissions"".

The outcome of the case would ""give a tailwind to climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, and thus to the move away from fossil fuels worldwide"", she said.

- 10-year legal fight -

RWE said in a statement it had ""always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law"".

Establishing such a liability could make it hard to do business in Germany, ""because it could ultimately allow for claims for climate-related damages being asserted against every German company anywhere in the world"", it said.

RWE had ""always operated its plants in compliance with applicable law"", it said.

""It would be an irreconcilable contradiction if the state permitted CO2 emissions, regulated them in detail and in some instances even required them, but at the same time retroactively imposed civil liability for them.""

Lliuya first filed a lawsuit in 2015 at a court in the western city of Essen, where RWE has its headquarters, demanding 17,000 euros ($18,400) towards flood defences for his community.

The Essen court dismissed the case, but in 2017 the higher district court in nearby Hamm allowed an appeal.

Lliuya based his claim on a study that concluded that RWE, which today uses a variety of power sources including wind, coal and gas, has been responsible for 0.38 percent of all global carbon emissions since the start of the industrial era.

In Wednesday's ruling, however, the court said the chances of Lliuya's home being flooded in the next 30 years was ""only about one percent"" and that high waters would ""not be able to endanger the structure of the house"".

The court in Hamm said the ruling was not open to appeal.

Despite going no further, the verdict in the farmer's case ""adds strength to a growing field of climate litigation"", said Joana Setzer of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

""Over 60 cases around the world are currently seeking to hold companies liable for climate-related losses and damages,"" Setzer said.

The decision by the court in Hamm would ""a powerful precedent to support those efforts"", she said.

While some Republicans in Congress have questioned the impacts of the IRA and have opposed it because they claim it would raise taxes without helping curb inflation, Stumpf said it has been ""nothing but a success so far,"" and encourages local elected officials to advocate for the clean energy investments that have been made possible.

""We're having really positive conversations on both sides of the aisle and we're hopeful that both sides can come to meaningful compromise.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

The transformer solution helps ensure a reliable power supply for hydrogen production from renewable energy, contributing to a sustainable energy future.

China is the world's largest hydrogen producer, listing hydrogen as a core part of its national energy strategy. It is pushing to replace fossil fuels with hydrogen in industries and promoting green ammonia and methanol production by using hydrogen.1 In late 2024, China released a plan to speed up clean hydrogen use in industry, providing clear steps for lowering carbon emissions and upgrading the sector.

The hydrogen energy project developed by CEEC is one of China’s largest green hydrogen-ammonia-methanol integrated projects globally. The project plans to build a 3-gigawatt (GW) new energy facility in phases using wind and solar power to produce hydrogen through water electrolysis. It then synthesizes ammonia and methanol from green hydrogen to achieve an integrated development of the entire value chain from clean electricity to hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol.

In water electrolysis for hydrogen production, the rectifier transformer is a key device that enables stable power supply and improves production efficiency. Hitachi Energy's transformer features a compact structure, low losses, and high stability. It provides excellent harmonic resistance and current impact resistance, ensuring safe, reliable, and cost-effective hydrogen production.

These tax credits have been working.
A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Montana’s residents who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills.
Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana.
I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.","On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Montana if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Montana. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

These tax credits have been working. Since 2022, Montana has benefited from $2.4 billion in specific investments covering 14 projects, and creating 3080 jobs. Mayors and county commissioners have been writing to our Montana delegation asking them to keep these tax credits because they are so beneficial.

The legislation has overwhelmingly helped Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Montana, where companies like Northwestern Energy (MT Hydro), Calumet/Montana Renewables, and NextEra, among others, have announced major investments thanks to these tax credits.

Counties from Cascade to Custer are thrilled — the tax revenues generated by the companies’ projects enable the counties to make large-scale renovations, build civic centers, and keep roads, bridges, and schools in great shape. If the tax credits are left intact, they could assist more companies to implement projects in all 56 counties, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in property taxes per year—money the counties won’t have to tax their citizens.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Montana ratepayers will face electricity prices that are up to 7% higher in the coming years.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean-energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects like upgrading and building transmission lines, hydroelectric power expansion, solar/wind farm projects, or even a potential nuclear plant in Colstrip currently being discussed in town hall meetings.

Households and local businesses will take a hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Montana’s residents who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners and ranchers to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

But, if they are protected, it would be a huge boost to Montana’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $8 billion to the state’s economy from 2025-2035 and support 5,200 full-time jobs in Montana annually. That’s real money and real livelihoods for Montanans.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are speaking up. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.” Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., wants to keep tax credits such as 45Q for carbon capture and 45U for existing nuclear power to also help reduce emissions while helping maintain dependable, affordable electricity.

Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.

Texas’s ample land and relatively hands-off regulatory environment have made it easier for developers to enter the state’s energy storage market, the Texas comptroller says.
Additionally, today is the last day for the Texas House to consider all bills on their second and third reading.
Nearly 12,500 Texans are employed and more than $50 billion is invested in the state’s solar industry, according to SEIA.","Three “anti-solar” bills, SB 819, SB 388 and SB 715, appear dead after failing to meet the state’s deadlines that would otherwise allow them to progress.

SB 819 would have placed additional fees, permitting restrictions, mandated setback and regulatory requirements on utility-scale solar and wind projects in Texas, which the state does not impose on other forms of energy. Despite the army of opposition the bill received while in committee, with more than 100 groups registering against the bill, the legislation passed the Senate 22-9 in April. Legislators did not take any action on SB 819 after it was engrossed and moved to the Texas House of Representatives.

“With people and energy-hungry industries flocking to Texas, we need an all-of-the-above strategy to meet demand, and solar and storage are the quickest resources able to be deployed to the grid,” Daniel Giese, the Texas state director for Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), told pv magazine USA.

SB 388 would have required at least half of all new generation in the ERCOT region come from “dispatchable generation other than energy storage.” The bill originally mandated the 50% threshold come from natural gas, but was amended to dispatchable generation “other than battery energy storage.”

Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, said that while the grid needs dispatchable energy resources, “we are not aware of any study by ERCOT, or any other entity that had determined that proportion to be optimal, or even an improvement from the status quo.”

Giese said Texas would be far more vulnerable to grid outages if new generation were limited to a small number of facilities. “The simple fact is Texas needs every resource on the grid to keep prices low for consumers and meet the demands of future population and business growth.”

Excluding California, Texas has more battery storage than the rest of the United States combined, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Additionally, the majority of Texas residents from both sides of the aisle believe solar paired with battery systems would make the grid more reliable and resilient, a survey by the SEIA, Global Strategy Group and North Star Opinion Research found last year.

Texas’s ample land and relatively hands-off regulatory environment have made it easier for developers to enter the state’s energy storage market, the Texas comptroller says. Added to this are plunging costs of lithium-ion batteries found by a BloombergNEF analysis and the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives, and energy storage’s position in the free market is bound to boom.

SB 715 aimed to establish a retroactive mandate that existing renewable energy installations install a backup energy source.

The legislation “would reduce reliability of the Texas power grid while increasing electricity costs for consumers, if enacted,” said Aurora Energy Research stated in a report.

The three bills missed Saturday’s deadline for legislation passed in the Senate to clear a committee vote in the House of Representatives. Additionally, today is the last day for the Texas House to consider all bills on their second and third reading.

“The failure of these three bills is a victory for ratepayers,” said Adrian Shelley, the director of Public Citizen’s Texas office. “It is also a tacit recognition by a legislature that is too friendly to fossil fuels that renewable energy sources are an indispensable part of powering the state,” he said.

Shelley said signing the bills into law would have meant higher energy prices and slowed the growth of energy sources that keep the Texas electric grid stable. He added, “When lawmakers return for their next session, the attacks on renewables must end in favor of legislation that will slow or reduce the state’s fast-rising demand for electricity.”

The anti-solar legislation came just as Texas began to take its place as one of the top states for installed solar capacity, which, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), is ranked first in the country for its utility-scale solar capacity. Nearly 12,500 Texans are employed and more than $50 billion is invested in the state’s solar industry, according to SEIA.

The conference brought together industry leaders from across the world to address the most pressing energy challenges and opportunities, including navigating the next wave of energy transition growth with a focus on reinvention, decarbonization, and business growth in an era of generative AI and increasing energy demand.

During a fireside chat with Exelon President and Chief Executive Officer Calvin Butler, the governor shared his perspective on leading the clean energy transformation; promoting clean energy as a means to promote economic growth and promoting sustainability in our energy sources.

Governor Moore on clean energy as a vehicle for economic growth:

“I knew that I could sum up what we needed to do in the State of Maryland in one word, and that was growth. We needed to make sure that our economy was growing. We needed to make sure that our economy was more competitive, and we needed to make sure that that growth was gonna be inclusive growth, And the thing that I always felt, and why this conversation around utilities and power became so important, was something had to power the growth. Something had to be the engine behind what we were getting going.”

“We really focused on how can we re-center the relationship that we have with our industry partners; do a better job of incentivizing people to be able to choose Maryland; come up with other additional avenues to be able to have grid enhancement and alternative sources while knowing that we can champion alternative sources and still do good things for consumers — but then also being able to listen and be a good partner with the industry about what is required.”

Governor Moore on energy affordability:

“I think we need to broaden our view of what clean energy actually is and how it correlates to the needs of our people. We can be a clean energy state while at the same time focusing on affordability for ratepayers — I don't think those have to be conflicting ideas. I just think we have to have the right infrastructure to be able to make those individualized things happen. And so I do think it goes back into — how are we focusing on both, short term diversification of options that people have.”

Governor Moore on promoting critical infrastructure and sustainable growth:

“Maryland should be the place where you can have additional measurements of growth, but it takes a measure of intentionality.”

“Passing legislation and working with industry to be able to pass what that legislation looks like; being able to do a better job of site readiness and identification of which places in the state could build and build fast to get that kind of infrastructure in place; and having that partnership with our utility partners to know that they could then power that level of growth—those were the three ingredients that we needed to create the correct kind of formula for the type of economic growth that I believe deeply and strongly is going to help create within our state.”

The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to advancing more sustainable, equitable, and affordable energy for all Marylanders. Over the past two and a half years, the governor has taken historic executive action to reduce emissions and promote clean energy standards; dedicated funding to create more equitable access to renewable energy sources; and secured more than $130 million in federal funding to create tens of thousands of green jobs—many of which do not require a college degree.

Most recently, Governor Moore signed the Next Generation Energy Act into law, which will modernize the state’s energy infrastructure, promote more in-state generation, and address rising utility costs that burden Maryland families. The bill expanded financial support to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions; established a procurement framework to advance nuclear energy and create more clean energy in the state; and will deliver meaningful relief to Maryland ratepayers, including a $200 million electricity bill credit directly to Maryland families.",https://governor.maryland.gov:443/https:/ci3.googleusercontent.com/meips/ADKq_NauRp68wgR0AQKisCnmnNBKbkMEbYuZ96mTqalIhoOcgLAR_zdoMs3WaTdlbQqVECPc9BawteB8W5VMGD_lGXmdeCY_qjQqzPp8SXqKDSLdQGJ0qn0qIoBlXEHvYYwb9uUUVmtsn89m0UAkQBIS6Y7hqJw1wdLmkZMs40apow=s0-d-e1-ft#https:/content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/MDGOV/2025/05/11696234/pi1-1709-1_original.jpeg,N,,2025-05-29 03:03:10.635940

We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy.
Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump's executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the ""very slow and very costly"" licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.
Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has ""identified some sites"" for potential development.
Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state's nuclear authority.","Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed ""nuclear energy nerd"" – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky's decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state's nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump's executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

""These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it's almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it's to that scale,"" Carroll said. ""That is the future.""

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment's prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that's still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by ""no later than 2030,"" though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump's executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

""These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,"" Long wrote. ""The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation's energy security.""

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump's executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the ""very slow and very costly"" licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has ""identified some sites"" for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state's largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

""Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,"" he said. ""There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don't think there's anything that couldn't be overcome with certain design changes.""

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state's nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state's Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky's next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the ""hyperscale"" data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

""I think, at this point, the one thing that we're really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,"" he added. ""Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That's been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.""

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state's baseload energy in years to come.

""To say that we're 'headed towards' a time when we don't have sufficient energy in this state – that's inaccurate. We're there. No question about it. We're there,"" he said. ""It's important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.""

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be ""a brand new economic driver"" for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with ""a sense of urgency.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08b46d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4665x2449+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F57%2Fada6085b45ec9d7a536a978509bb%2F28074713764-554d1f9a4f-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 05:02:11.526355

The report updates a previous assessment from 2008 and emphasizes the role of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) in unlocking this potential.
According to the USGS, most existing geothermal electricity generation relies on hydrothermal systems where groundwater naturally circulates through heated, permeable rock.
If enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology advances as projected, the potential for power generation from these systems significantly increases with depth, as deeper rock formations tend to be hotter.
This upper bound could result in an astounding 13 TW of power, roughly ten times the current U.S. power generation capacity.","The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has indicated that geothermal energy in Nevada’s Great Basin and adjoining areas could potentially supply electricity equivalent to one-tenth of the current U.S. power demand.

This represents a significant increase from current levels, as geothermal energy currently contributes less than 1% to the national power grid. The report updates a previous assessment from 2008 and emphasizes the role of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) in unlocking this potential.

The study covers the arid lands of the Great Basin, including parts of California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah. The projected 10% contribution to national electricity needs hinges on widespread commercial-scale development and ongoing technological advancements, particularly those developed in the geothermal and oil and gas sectors over the past few decades.

According to the USGS, most existing geothermal electricity generation relies on hydrothermal systems where groundwater naturally circulates through heated, permeable rock. However, the bulk of geothermal potential lies in areas where heat is trapped in impermeable rock. In such cases, EGS is required.

These systems involve engineering open fractures into impermeable rock as deep as 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) below the Earth’s surface, allowing water to circulate and extract heat for electricity generation.

The new assessment incorporates technological developments in mapping and subsurface surveys, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. New heat flow and underground temperature maps were created, along with methods to estimate energy extraction efficiency and the conversion of heat into electricity.

The USGS assessment of undiscovered geothermal resources reflects future potential and areas that have not yet been fully explored or developed.

Sarah Ryker, acting USGS director, stated that the Great Basin was selected due to its known history of geothermal activity and that current findings indicate even greater potential for baseload power than previously understood.

“Leveraging this work along with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will help us assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy with greater speed and accuracy,” she said.

The USGS also highlighted the dual benefit of modern mapping techniques, which now support the identification of geothermal energy, critical minerals, and, in some cases, groundwater. While the geothermal heat in the Great Basin has been confirmed, realizing its full potential depends on further improvements in engineering efficiency and the commercial deployment of enhanced geothermal technologies.

If enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology advances as projected, the potential for power generation from these systems significantly increases with depth, as deeper rock formations tend to be hotter.

While depths exceeding 6 km might necessitate further technological breakthroughs, the current provisional estimate for the Great Basin, spanning 633,072 sq km, suggests a total EGS power production capacity of 135 GW.

This figure represents only 0.5% of the accessible electric-grade resource, indicating that 99.5% of the thermal energy remains as residual.

Notably, thermal resources from active hydrothermal systems, which account for less than 1% of the total rock volume, are not factored into this estimate. This new assessment aligns with the 518 GW estimated in the 2008 geothermal assessment for the upper 6 km of the larger western U.S., with Nevada and Utah alone contributing an estimated 150 GW.

While it is improbable to achieve the most extreme production efficiencies, these values establish a spectrum for the resource, ranging from negligible (if suitable geological conditions are scarce) to an impressive 44% of the resource base becoming useful. This upper bound could result in an astounding 13 TW of power, roughly ten times the current U.S. power generation capacity.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final rules for the clean electricity investment and production tax credits (technology-neutral credits). The final rules clarify which clean electricity zero-emission technologies qualify for the credits. These include wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic, geothermal, nuclear, and specific waste energy recovery technologies.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2519533361-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:01.285292

It makes it more likely that those living at the sharp edge of climate change, such as Saul and his community, can succeed in holding heavy emitters to account for the damage they cause.""
""The science is absolutely clear... Human-induced climate change is already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe,"" Otto said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
""This includes Saul's city of Huaraz and RWE contributed without any doubt to climate change.""
""The precedent that this case has set underlines just how important scientific evidence is in the global fight against climate change,"" Otto added.","After a decade of legal proceedings, a German court on Wednesday dismissed a Peruvian farmer's case against energy giant RWE, but both he and green groups still hailed what they called a ""landmark ruling"" that launched a ""new era of accountability"" by ""setting a powerful precedent.""

The farmer, 44-year-old Saúl Luciano Lliuya, grows barley, corn, potatoes, and wheat outside Huaraz, Peru. In 2015, he sued RWE—one of Europe's biggest climate polluters—in Essen, Germany, where the company is headquartered. Although the German utility doesn't operate in Luciano Lliuya's country, he argued that its emissions contributed to the melting of Andean glaciers.

""He said that as a result, Lake Palcacocha—which is located above the city—now has four times as much water than in 2003 and that residents like him were at risk of flooding, especially if blocks of ice were to break off from Palcacocha glacier and fall into the lake, causing it to overflow,"" according to the BBC. The farmer sought around €17,000, or $19,000, from RWE toward a $3.5 million project to protect Huaraz.

As Reutersreported Wednesday:

Presiding judge Rolf Meyer, at the court in the western city of Hamm, said experts' estimate of the 30-year damage risk to the plaintiff's house of 1% was not enough to take the case further.

Had there been a larger adverse effect, a polluter could have been made to slash emissions or pay damages, Meyer said.

Meyer said the plaintiff's case was argued coherently and that it was ""like a microcosm of the world's problems between people of the southern and the northern hemisphere, between the poor and the rich.""

""Today the mountains have won,"" Luciano Lliuya said in a Wednesday statement. ""Even if my case doesn't go any further, it has reached an important milestone, and that makes me proud. This ruling shows that the big polluters driving the climate can finally be held legally responsible for the harm they have caused.""

""I am, of course, disappointed that the court reached a different conclusion from the glacier scientists who have studied this region for decades and believe my home is at risk,"" he continued. ""We won't receive support from RWE to protect us from the flood risk. But this case was never just about me. It was about all the people who, like us in Huaraz, are already living with the consequences of a crisis we did not create. This ruling opens the door for others to demand justice.""

The farmer's lawyer, Roda Verheyen, also framed the decision as a major step forward, saying that ""today's ruling is a milestone and will give a tailwind to climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, and thus to the move away from fossil fuels worldwide. The plaintiff is grateful to the German courts for the seriousness with which his case was treated.""

Other advocates and experts similarly weighed in. Ecojustice climate director Charlie Hatt declared that ""this is a historic moment for climate litigation,"" while University of Oxford professor Thom Wetzer said that ""this decadelong case has borne fruit,"" setting ""a remarkable precedent that could enable future cases.""

Jasper Tuelings, a strategic adviser with Climate Litigation Network, said that ""this historic judgment lays the next building block in corporate climate accountability. Last year's Shell ruling showed us that big polluters have a legal obligation to reduce their future emissions in line with the Paris agreement—today's ruling affirms that these companies can be held accountable for their past emissions too.""

RWE, meanwhile, said in a statement that ""the decision of the Hamm Higher Regional Court means that the attempt, supported by German NGOs, to use Mr Luciano Lliuya's lawsuit to create a precedent for holding individual companies responsible for the effects of climate change worldwide under German law has failed.""

""RWE has always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law,"" RWE added, warning of ""unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location,"" and noting that ""other German courts have dismissed similar climate lawsuits—for example against Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.""

Despite the company's comments, climate advocates appeared undeterred. Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said that ""Saul's breakthrough opens up a well of opportunities for the more than 40 similar cases ongoing. It makes it more likely that those living at the sharp edge of climate change, such as Saul and his community, can succeed in holding heavy emitters to account for the damage they cause.""

Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, highlighted how science has evolved since Luciano Lliuya's case began a decade ago, which could impact ongoing and future legal proceedings.

""The science is absolutely clear... Human-induced climate change is already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe,"" Otto said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""This includes Saul's city of Huaraz and RWE contributed without any doubt to climate change.""

""The precedent that this case has set underlines just how important scientific evidence is in the global fight against climate change,"" Otto added. ""Since the case was filed 10 years ago, scientists have developed a large body of evidence showing how much companies and states can be held responsible for climate disasters. This is therefore a landmark moment for climate justice, ensuring that communities living in constant danger can hold carbon majors to account.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60333627&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-05-29 10:21:07.812101

The American Council of Engineering Companies of Kentucky presented the UK team with the Grand Award at the 2025 Engineering Excellence Awards on May 20 in Washington, DC.

Developed in collaboration with Bell Engineering and supported by a Stormwater Infrastructure Grant from the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, the system is designed to capture up to 25 million gallons of stormwater annually from the 170 million gallons that flow into the Wolf Run watershed.

“The stormwater harvesting system plays a critical role in helping us offset campus water usage and manage stormwater runoff,” said Britney Ragland, associate director of Utilities and Energy Management. “If we can capture, reuse and return this water to the environment, it reduces our footprint on the local water system while also benefiting the local watershed.”

The CUP cooling plant alone uses more than 45 million gallons of water each year and the stormwater harvesting system offsets a substantial portion of that demand, providing a meaningful environmental and operational benefit for the university.

In addition to its practical applications, the project also has an educational component. Engineering senior design teams from mechanical, civil, and biosystems engineering, along with two engineering interns, conducted studies on various aspects of the system throughout this past academic year.

University of Kentucky

When Michael McGlue, Ph.D., took the helm of the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) last fall, he took on a key role at a pivotal time as Kentucky faces increasingly extreme weather.

“Kentucky really is a paradise for geologists,” said McGlue, a University o Kentucky alumni endowed professor and KGS director. “There are so many different aspects to the natural environment here that are fascinating. When I took over as director of the 14th Kentucky Geological Survey, a big motivation for me was to push hard on helping the state become more resilient to natural hazards.”

McGlue is leading a bold initiative focused on hazard preparedness, geoscience education and workforce development. At the heart of that agenda is the CLIMBS project, a major initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, uniting multiple Kentucky universities to prepare communities for the intensifying impacts of evolving weather patterns.

“Ultimately, we want our people to be healthy and safe. We want our infrastructure to be strong,” McGlue said. “And so, we need to prepare for extreme weather events that might trigger floods and landslides.”

The CLIMBS project goes beyond modeling environmental threats — it’s preparing students and communities. With funding for educational outreach and student training, McGlue sees the initiative as an important step toward strengthening Kentucky’s geoscience workforce.

“We really need to develop a workforce that has skills in the geosciences,” McGlue said. “That’s something that’s, at the moment, lacking in the state. We really need it to build our workforce moving into the future, to be climate and hazard ready.”

McGlue, a field scientist by background, brings that same philosophy into the classroom and lab.

“I think it’s really important for students to get out in nature and make observations,” McGlue said. “I want them to understand the world that surrounds them, ask good questions and critically think through how to solve problems.”

Students can also engage in projects under the mentorship of seasoned geologists through programs like the Paul Edwin Potter Internship at KGS. The program provides Kentucky university students interested in geoscience and adjacent research areas like geography, public health, data science and engineering the opportunity to get real-world experience and engage in a hands-on research project.

KGS also improves public access to geological data through its user-friendly website with interactive maps and resources for researchers, educators, industry and the general public. KGS researchers are actively engaged in projects that touch energy, water resources, natural hazards, karst, geohealth and more. KGS data are accessible and freely available to all stakeholders.

Nissan offers buyouts for US workers at its Canton plant

Nissan has been in the spotlight over the past few weeks for all the wrong reasons. It began earlier this month, following the company’s announcement that it was abandoning plans to build a new EV battery plant in Japan.

The facility was set to produce lower-cost LFP batteries, which have been key to BYD and other Chinese EV brands’ rapid rise in the global auto industry. With an annual production capacity of up to 5 GWh, the plant was expected to slash EV battery costs by 20% to 30%.

Facing slumping sales, lower profits, and more competition, Nissan launched its new recovery plan, dubbed “Re:Nissan,” earlier this month.

The comeback strategy involves cutting 20,000 jobs, or around 15% of its global workforce, by 2027. Nissan is also closing several plants to slash costs by 250 billion yen as it aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.

According to an internal email, viewed by Reuters, Nissan is offering buyouts for US workers at its Canton plant. The email also stated that merit-based pay increases are suspended globally.

Christian Meunier, Nissan America’s chairman, said the buyouts are “crucial for Nissan’s comeback” in the US, its most important market.

“While substantial efforts have been made in the US to help right-size Nissan, we need to take additional, limited, strategic action here at a local level,” Meunier said in an email.

Nissan announced a voluntary separation program for a select number of US salaried employees. Since the plan is still ongoing, Nissan didn’t provide any further details.

On Wednesday, a separate report from Bloomberg News claimed that Nissan is looking to raise over 1 trillion yen ($6.9 billion) with the help of the UK government to repay a massive loan due next year.

Nissan invested $500 million to upgrade its Canton plant for electric vehicle (EV) production in the US. Although it initially planned to begin building EVs in the US this year, Nissan delayed production until at least 2028.

Later this year, Nissan will launch the upgraded LEAF, now with a longer driving range, an NACS charging port, and a more SUV-like design. It will be one of ten new Nissan or Infiniti models to launch by 2027.

Electrek’s Take

As Electrek reported yesterday, Nissan’s comeback plan hinges on its upgraded e-Power technology. The only issue is that the system is designed for hybrids.

Nissan is following in Toyota and Honda’s footsteps by advancing new hybrid and plug-in hybrid tech, but the company is already two steps behind.

Doubling down on hybrids and PHEVs while delaying more EV projects will likely only set Nissan up for failure over the next few years.

The Japanese automaker is already losing market share in some of its biggest markets, like China and Southeast Asia.

Can Nissan turn things around in the US, its most important market? Or, will it continue to fall out of favor with lower-cost, more advanced EVs on the way from brands like Rivian and Lucid?

The company said this takes them into “previously uncharted territory” in terms of electrolyte strategy and the research could pay big dividends.

As CATL explained, the breakthrough could enable LMBs to have both a high energy density and a long lifecycle. Speaking of the latter, a prototype lasted 483 cycles and could be “incorporated into state-of-the-art designs to achieve an energy density of over 500 Wh/kg.”

To put that number into perspective, the solid state battery that Stellantis and Factorial are working on has an energy density of 375 Wh/kg. That means CATL’s lithium metal battery could beat it by over 33%.

CATL says “LMBs are widely regarded as the next-generation battery system thanks to their intrinsically high energy density, especially for high-end power applications such as long-range electric vehicles and electric aviation.” However, the company said the tradeoff has been a short lifecycle, which doesn’t make them commercially viable.

To help solve the problem, CATL “developed and refined a suite of analytical techniques to track the evolution of active lithium and each electrolyte component throughout the battery’s life cycle. This approach transformed a ‘black box’ into a ‘white box’, unveiling the critical depletion pathways driving cell failure.”

While previous assumptions pointed the finger at “solvent breakdown, dead lithium accumulation, or solvation environment disruption,” the dominant cause of cell failure is actually the “continuous consumption of the electrolyte salt LiFSI.” 71% is consumed by the time the battery dies and the firm says this shows there needs to be a focus on “electrolyte durability as a critical factor for sustained performance.”

CATL used the findings to create an optimized electrolyte formulation with a lower molecular weight diluent. The company says this “increased the LiFSI salt’s mass fraction, improved ionic conductivity, and reduced viscosity, all without increasing the total mass of electrolyte used.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ergfgrewgregregre.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 01:05:19.508872

Countries leading in solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies attract a growing workforce dedicated to sustainable solutions. These locations benefit from supportive policies, investment, and infrastructure that foster innovation and job creation. Understanding where people work in renewable energy highlights global efforts to transition to greener power sources and showcases areas driving the future of sustainable energy.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) recently revealed that the global renewable energy workforce reached 16.2 million people in 2023, marking a significant rise from 11 million employees in 2018. This increase underscores the rapid growth and expanding reach of the renewable energy sector worldwide. While employment opportunities in this industry are spreading across a wider range of countries, the majority of jobs remain concentrated in just a few key nations.

China stands out as the dominant force in renewable energy employment. In 2023, the country accounted for an impressive 7.3 million jobs within the renewable energy sector, representing nearly 45 percent of the worldwide total. This dominant share highlights China’s extensive investment and development in clean energy technologies, particularly in solar, wind, and hydropower industries. The country’s commitment to transitioning towards sustainable energy sources has positioned it as the global leader in both renewable energy production and employment.

Following China, Brazil holds the second spot for the largest renewable energy workforce. Despite its position as a distant runner-up compared to China’s massive workforce, Brazil’s renewable energy sector employed around 1.6 million people in 2023. The country’s strong emphasis on biofuels production, particularly ethanol derived from sugarcane, has made it the largest employer in the biofuels sector globally. Brazil’s renewable energy landscape benefits from abundant natural resources and policies that support sustainable energy development, contributing to its substantial green workforce.

Interestingly, when comparing Brazil’s workforce with the collective renewable energy employment in the European Union and Asia (excluding China and India), these regions have larger combined workforces. The European Union and parts of Asia have invested heavily in diverse renewable energy technologies, creating broad opportunities for employment across multiple countries. This collective growth reflects the increasing importance of clean energy in economic and environmental strategies globally.

In the United States, the renewable energy sector has also experienced notable growth over the past five years. Employment in this field expanded from 855,000 jobs in 2018 to approximately 1.1 million in 2023. This growth reflects increased investment in solar and wind energy projects, as well as advancements in energy efficiency and battery storage technologies. The expanding clean energy market in the U.S. continues to generate jobs across manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and related services, underscoring the sector’s role in economic development.

India is another country that has witnessed remarkable gains in renewable energy employment recently. The number of green jobs grew from 719,000 in 2018 to 1 million in 2023. This rapid expansion aligns with India’s ambitious renewable energy targets, which include significant increases in solar and wind capacity. Government initiatives and international support have accelerated investments in clean energy infrastructure, boosting job creation in manufacturing, project development, and operations. India’s growing workforce in renewable energy signals its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and fostering sustainable economic growth.

The global increase in renewable energy employment reflects broader trends in energy transition and environmental policy. As countries prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change, investments in renewable technologies are intensifying. This shift is not only transforming energy production but also creating millions of new job opportunities across a variety of sectors, from research and development to on-the-ground operations.

Despite the expanding geographic diversity in renewable energy jobs, the concentration of employment in a few countries highlights disparities in access to clean energy investments and infrastructure. While nations like China, Brazil, the United States, and India lead in job creation, many other regions still lag behind in developing their renewable energy sectors. Addressing these gaps requires targeted policies, financial incentives, and international cooperation to promote sustainable energy development globally.

In summary, the renewable energy industry has shown significant growth in employment over recent years, reaching over 16 million jobs worldwide in 2023. China leads this growth by a wide margin, followed by Brazil, with the United States and India also making substantial gains. This surge in renewable energy employment reflects a global movement toward greener energy sources and a more sustainable future. Continued expansion and diversification of the workforce will be crucial to meeting climate goals and ensuring inclusive economic opportunities across the world.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

(TNS)

A Republican-backed tax-and-spending bill passed by the U.S. House on Thursday aims to roll back federal clean energy incentives—a move critics warn could raise costs for consumers and derail investments in Georgia’s burgeoning electric vehicle and battery industry.

The GOP bill, backed by President Donald Trump, targets provisions in then-President Joe Biden’s signature climate and health bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. These include the $7,500 federal tax credit for buyers of EVs largely manufactured in North America, production tax credits for manufacturers of EVs and batteries, and funding for EV charging stations.

The bill, which will now be debated in the Senate and could undergo changes, also includes a new annual fee for electric vehicle and truck owners that would make buying and owning an electric vehicle more expensive.

Georgia is among states that led in the number of jobs created—and expected to come—in clean energy since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, according to researchers at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider that combines policy expertise and data-driven analysis to help decision-makers navigate global challenges.

The manufacturing tax credits and incentives for buyers have spurred U.S. investment, with Georgia being one of the epicenters with about 38,000 created and promised jobs.

Kia committed more than $200 million and the creation of more than 200 jobs at its West Point plant to accommodate assembly of the company’s EV9 SUV. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s Metaplant near Savannah, which is producing the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 models, is a more than $7 billion investment the company has promised will eventually employ 8,500 people. EV upstart Rivian plans to build a manufacturing site near Social Circle, east of Atlanta.

Some industry leaders and observers, however, are warning the policy shift could slow project rollout.

Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which represents many EV and battery manufacturers, said companies may “reassess the scale and the pace of their investments in the United States.”

U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D- Ga., called the tax-and-spending bill “a win for China’s economy and a loss for Georgia workers.”

China is a top EV manufacturing nation and the country, like many advanced economies, is adopting electric vehicles at a far faster pace than the U.S.

“Georgia has been a national leader in creating clean energy jobs, particularly with new battery and electric vehicle supply chains coming to our state’s rural communities,” Warnock said in a statement, calling the legislation “a non-starter for me in the Senate.”

Fully electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions, reducing harmful exhaust that pollutes the air and contributes planet-warming carbon to the atmosphere.

The IRA took an existing U.S. EV tax credit and narrowed criteria to qualify to vehicles that are predominantly made in North America to encourage reshoring of jobs and investment. Biden had campaigned in 2020 on expanding EV adoption in the U.S.

But Hyundai Chief Executive Officer Joseph Muñoz previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that “(c)onsumer preferences—not politics or government politics—dictate Hyundai’s business decisions.”

The automaker has said it decided to build an EV factory in the U.S. during Trump’s first term, and announced it would build the facility in Georgia shortly before passage of the IRA in 2022.

Because of new criteria in the IRA, EVs made by Hyundai and other automakers lost eligibility. Vehicles it makes in the U.S. now get at least partial credit.

Hyundai has never invested in the U.S. based on incentives, Muñoz said previously, instead focusing on the market opportunity. Hyundai and Kia representatives were not immediately available for interviews.

Gov. Brian Kemp’s office also emphasized the “market-based approach” Georgia takes on economic development. A spokesperson told the AJC that thanks to the state’s efforts, “the e-mobility space was already growing in Georgia before the federal government’s intervention.” Kemp “vocally opposed the Biden administration’s decision to not only pick winners and losers but also to impose counterproductive mandates that disadvantaged Georgia-based auto manufacturers and disincentivized organic consumer adoption of electric vehicle,” the spokesperson added.

Subsidy repeals could deter consumer demand for electric vehicles, Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valadez Streaty said. Cox Automotive, like the AJC, is owned by Cox Enterprises. Cox Enterprises also has about a 3% stake in Rivian.

EVs made up about 7.5% of total U.S. new vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025, per data from Cox Automotive, and the figure is growing, though not as fast as many industry observers expected. That’s in part because of fears over range and charging away from home and because of persistently high interest rates for vehicle loans. EVs also generally have higher sticker prices.

In the short term, Streaty said, sales might grow as consumers look to buy electric vehicles before incentives go away. But in the long term, she said, there might be negative consequences because of price premiums on EVs. A survey of dealers conducted by Cox Automotive in the second quarter of 2025 revealed that “a majority of auto dealers feel the tax credits are having a positive effect on the market.”

One independent dealer commented in the Cox report that consumers appear worried about limited infrastructure for electric vehicles and “fear of plummeting value and inability to repair anything but the simplest of issues,” among other things.

Kevin Ketels, an associate professor of supply chain management at Wayne State University, said electric vehicles are expensive as is. To keep advancing the industry, he said, there needs to be a wider portfolio of vehicles that include lower cost EVs with fewer features than the expensive models on the market.

“If we discontinue the incentives in order to develop and roll out this technology, it’s going to happen at a much slower pace, and we’re going to fall behind the rest of the world,” he said. The U.S. is already lagging behind China in creating EV manufacturing processes and supply chains, he added.

Although current incentives largely benefit affluent customers, “if we give more time and there are more government incentives to make this transition, I think it would benefit less affluent customers in that situation,” Ketels added.

— Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA

HOUSTON , TX, UNITED STATES, May 28, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- PV Hardware USA (PVH USA), a global leader in solar tracking and foundation solutions, announced today it has the capacity to immediately Safe Harbor 5GW of tracker product, offering solar developers a critical opportunity to preserve eligibility for current clean energy tax credits amid legislative uncertainty.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While it has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, the legislation in its current form poses significant implications for the solar industry. PVH is encouraging developers to prepare accordingly.

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA. “We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics.”

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project’s total capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been incurred before any new legislative changes take effect. By procuring tracker products now, developers can lock in the current, more favorable incentive structure. PVH USA’s readiness to support up to 5GW of Safe Harbor product can help developers meet these CAPEX thresholds quickly, mitigating risk and preserving the long-term viability of their projects.

“PVH’s scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,” Bitar said. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country’s largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. To date, the IRA is cited with helping to generate 330,000 new clean energy jobs and more than $70 billion in private investment in the American economy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed “nuclear energy nerd” – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky’s decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state’s nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump’s executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

“These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We’re seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it’s almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it’s to that scale,” Carroll said. “That is the future.”

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment’s prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that’s still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by “no later than 2030,” though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump’s executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

“These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,” Long wrote. “The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation’s energy security.”

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump’s executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the “very slow and very costly” licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state’s largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

“Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,” he said. “There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don’t think there’s anything that couldn’t be overcome with certain design changes.”

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state’s nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state’s Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky’s next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the “hyperscale” data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

“I think, at this point, the one thing that we’re really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,” he added. “Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That’s been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.”

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state’s baseload energy in years to come.

“To say that we’re ‘headed towards’ a time when we don’t have sufficient energy in this state – that’s inaccurate. We’re there. No question about it. We’re there,” he said. “It’s important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.”

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be “a brand new economic driver” for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with “a sense of urgency.”

“Our goal is not just to get nuclear reactors in Kentucky. It’s to create an entire nuclear ecosystem within the commonwealth that’s taking advantage of all aspects of nuclear energy development: research, industrialization, building, parts, education, whatever it might be. We want to take full advantage of it,” he said.",https://hoptownchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/power-plant.jpeg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:05.437310

The bill would phase out federal tax credits for both industry clean energy projects, and swiftly end individual consumer tax credits for things like solar panels and electric vehicles by the end of 2025.

It would also require manufacturers to conduct extensive supply chain checks for any foreign connections, particularly from China and Russia, for components used in clean energy projects, and set federal tax credit application timelines that will be virtually impossible to meet, according to the group, thus ""kneecapping"" investment in clean energy industries across the U.S.

That would act as a dramatic obstacle for Michigan's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“We’re signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump said Friday during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.

The actions follow the release earlier this month of his proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 spending that would slash more than $400 million from the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

Specifically, the newly signed executive orders allow for reactor design testing at the DOE’s National Labs; permit the DOE and the U.S. Department of Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land; ramp up the nation’s mining and enrichment of uranium; and require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) — which licenses nuclear reactors — to do so within 18 months of a requested license, according to the White House.

“Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America — that ends now,” said White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios on Friday. “Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades.”

Kratsios added that the goal is to restore a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuild a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and lead the world toward a future fueled by American nuclear energy.

“These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies,” he said.

Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) President and CEO Maria Korsnick attended the signing ceremony at the White House for the four executive orders signed by Trump.

“We appreciate the administration’s ongoing actions to preserve existing nuclear plants and usher in the deployment of next generation nuclear,” an NEI spokesperson said in a May 23 statement. “Policies to strengthen nuclear are essential to bolstering our national security and meeting our energy goals.”

NEI also said it looks forward to working with the administration and other stakeholders to ensure the implementation of the orders will help to build a reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy system.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright pointed out that the emergence of AI and the administration’s “pro-American manufacturing policies” will help unleash civil nuclear energy at the perfect time.

“Nuclear has the potential to be America’s greatest source of energy addition,” said Wright. “President Trump’s executive orders today unshackle our civil nuclear energy industry and ensure it can meet this critical moment.”

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the executive orders expand the administration’s so-called “Energy Dominance” agenda.

“As energy demand continues to surge, expanding our existing nuclear fleet and investing in advanced nuclear technologies ensures we have reliable energy to power our homes, fuel for President Trump’s manufacturing revolution, and a stronger electric grid,” said Burgum.

Asked about whether the executive orders would result in any reduction in NRC staff, a government official told CNN that, “reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”

The order to reform the NRC says the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”

In addition to these four orders, the president signed an executive order implementing what the White House has dubbed the “Gold Standard Science” to rebuild public trust in the national science enterprise.

The executive order defines the gold-standard science as “reproducible, transparent, falsifiable, subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, collaborative, interdisciplinary, accepting of negative results, and free from conflicts of interests.”

It also requires federal research agencies to conform their existing programs and activities to these fundamentals.

In addition to federal agencies, the administration is issuing a call to excellence for all American researchers and academic institutions to go back to the basics by restoring this gold standard.

“With this executive order, we are recommitting ourselves to scientific best practices and empowering America’s researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries,” Kratsios said, noting that the standard “starts in the policies and programs of our great federal research institutions, and continues with partnership across academia, industry, and philanthropy.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shutterstock_1038346219.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:10.147230

Saúl Luciano Lliuya, who lives in a city in the central Ancash region, in the heart of the Andes, sued RWE, one of Europe's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, over the risk of flooding to his home from a glacial lake swollen by climate change. Although RWE has never operated in Peru, Luciano Lliuya argued the company's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers threatening his city.

But a court in Hamm, in northwestern Germany, ruled that the probability of the lake bursting its banks and devastating his home and the homes of some 50,000 other people in the area was too small for RWE to be held liable. It also barred him from appealing the verdict.

The ruling brings to an end a decade-long lawsuit in which Luciano Lliuya, supported by environmental group Germanwatch, had sought roughly $18,000 from RWE to pay for 0.5% of the cost of building a dyke to protect his home and the homes of his neighbors - the percentage equal to the proportion of RWA's total historic carbon emissions according to Germanwatch.

The company is now moving quickly into renewable energy and vows to become carbon neutral by 2040. But its power plants have been running on coal for more than a century.

Germanwatch warned that Lake Palcacocha had swollen to more than 30 times its historic volume and could overflow catastrophically in the event of an avalanche.

Ultimately, the court ruled that the probability of that happening was just over 1% in the next 30 years, below the threshold under German law for RWE to be found liable.

The German energy giant had argued that the issue of climate change should be resolved by governments and not in a court. In a statement after the verdict on Wednesday, RWE said a win against them would have had ""unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location, because ultimately claims could be asserted against any German company anywhere in the world for damage caused by climate change.""

This is just one of a wave of climate litigation cases against big industry and governments in recent years. Germanwatch is still claiming a win. It says that the court ruled on the specific risk of Lake Palcacocha bursting its banks. But, by allowing the case to proceed through the German court system for a decade, had accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs from around the world can use German property laws to sue German companies over their carbon emissions.

Petra Minnerop, an expert in international climate law at the United Kingdom's Durham University, who was not involved in the case, broadly backed Germanwatch's interpretation. ""It was only a factual question, not a legal one,"" she told NPR, meaning that the door remained open for similar litigation in Germany.

Summary of General Tax Provisions Impacting Domestic and Multinational Businesses

The House Bill temporarily suspends the requirement to capitalize and amortize domestic R&D expenses for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2030. Foreign R&D costs must still be amortized over a 15-year period.

The deduction afforded to owners of certain pass-through businesses for qualified business income (QBI) is increased to 23 percent (resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.49 percent on QBI) and permanently extended. In addition, the complex phase-in limitations are replaced with a simplified two-step process that reduces the deduction for taxpayers with taxable income over the threshold amount, increasing the availability of the deduction.

The House Bill reinstates “bonus depreciation” for qualified property placed in service on or after January 20, 2025, and before January 1, 2030 (with certain exceptions), and increases the thresholds on permitted bonus depreciation. In addition, the full cost of certain “qualified production property” acquired or for which construction begins on or after January 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and that is placed into service before January 1, 2033, is also eligible for bonus depreciation. The property must be used in connection with the manufacturing, agriculture and chemical production or refining of tangible personal property and must result in “a substantial transformation of the property comprising the product.”

The calculation of the cap on the deduction for net business interest expense is changed from 30 percent of a taxpayer's earnings before income taxes (EBIT) to 30 percent of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as was the case prior to January 1, 2022.

Thresholds for filing IRS Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC (miscellaneous income and nonemployee compensation, respectively) reporting is increased from at least $600 in a taxable year to at least $2,000 in a taxable year, indexed to inflation. The threshold for filing IRS Form 1099-K (payment card and third-party transactions) is increased from at least $600 in a taxable year to more than $20,000 and 200 transactions, significantly reducing the 1099-K filing burdens.

As anticipated, the House Bill increases the cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from $10,000 (or $20,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The cap is phased down to $10,000 for taxpayers with a modified gross income over $500,000 (or $5,000 and $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The House Bill also eliminates the pass-through entity tax (PTET) workaround for businesses engaged in Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTBs), which has been a popular planning tool for owners in pass-through entities.

The House Bill slightly decreases rates for deduction of foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) (from 37.5 percent to 36.5 percent and 50 percent to 49.2 percent, respectively), but the proposed rates are significantly higher than rate cuts expected to go into effect on January 1, 2026 (21.875 percent and 37.5 percent). Similarly, the House Bill sets the rate on base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) to 10.1 percent from 10 percent currently, but lower than the 12.5 percent rate expected to go into effect on January 1, 2026.

In what appears to be a reaction to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two initiative, the House Bill introduces a new income tax regime that increases tax rates on taxpayers associated with foreign countries that impose an “unfair foreign tax,” including taxes imposed under an undertaxed profits rule, digital services taxes, and diverted profits taxes. Payments made to persons associates with such countries may also be subject to increased withholding tax rates.

Summary of Provisions Impacting the Energy and Climate Solutions Sector

Eight tax credits enacted or extended by the IRA would fully terminate on December 31, 2025, including all of the electric vehicle (EV)-related tax credits and certain energy efficient home credits.

The clean energy production credit (Tech-Neutral PTC) and clean energy investment credit (Tech Neutral ITC) would terminate for any qualified facility (other than qualified nuclear facilities) or energy storage technology (EST), as applicable, which begins construction more than 60 days after enactment of the House Bill, and for any qualified facility (other than qualified nuclear facilities) or EST, as applicable, that is placed in service after 2028. In addition, several other energy-related credits would terminate earlier than what is provided for under current law.

The House Bill retains IRA’s transferability regime for eligible credits, subject to the timing of the underlying credit and, in some cases, earlier termination dates specifically for transferability.

The House Bill introduces significant restrictions beginning in 2026 around certain “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs), which includes both “specified foreign entities” (SFEs) and “foreign-influenced entities” (FIEs). SFEs consist of various foreign entities of concern appearing on certain national security lists, as well as “foreign-controlled entities,” which are focused on the “covered nations” of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, and FIEs include entities for which one or more SFE has significant ownership, control, or influence over its operations. These rules limit not only who can invest in renewable energy projects, but also who can supply components and know-how to develop them.

Except for the foreign entity restrictions discussed above, the House Bill would not affect the carbon sequestration tax credit and extends the clean fuels tax credit to a new proposed termination date of December 31, 2031. In addition, the House Bill requires that to qualify for the clean fuels tax credit, the fuel produced must be exclusively derived from a feedstock produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.

[3] Homes that have commenced construction by May 12, 2025, are eligible for the credit if they are acquired by December 31, 2026.

[4] Under the termination dates provided by both IRA and the House Bill, hydrogen facilities must have begun construction on or prior to the relevant termination date to be eligible for the 10-year production-based credit.

[5] Under IRA, the Section 45X credit begins to phase out in 2030 when the credit is worth 75 percent, and steps down in 25 percent increments until full termination in 2033; this phase-out schedule only applies to eligible components and not critical minerals.

[6] The House Bill does not change the existing phase-out schedule, meaning the credit would be worth 75 percent in 2030 and 50 percent in 2031, and also imposes this schedule (and termination) on critical minerals.

[7] Under the House Bill, the legacy ITC for geothermal heat pumps would phase out as follows: for property beginning construction in 2030, the base credit would be 5.2 percent (26 percent with prevailing wage and apprenticeship multiplier) and for property beginning construction in 2031, the base credit would be 4.4 percent (22 percent with prevailing wage and apprenticeship multiplier).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7499_58.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 22:04:17.278897

THE MUSK EFFECT: Elon Musk played a key role in killing California’s electric vehicle mandate — and he’s still a thorn in the side of Democrats as they try to get their EV ambitions back on track.

A new national poll conducted by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report just before Senate Republicans voted last week to revoke California’s vehicle emissions rules — shared exclusively with POLITICO — shows how much Musk and Tesla have complicated the EV landscape for Democratic voters.

While liberal voters — the most likely buyers of EVs — leaned toward both supporting requirements for car companies to sell more electric models and keeping California’s ability to set stronger-than-federal emissions standards, they don’t like the credit-trading system state officials devised to make that happen.

More than half of Democrats surveyed — 56 percent — said they oppose “allowing carmakers to sell their extra credits to other carmakers” that don’t hit their sales targets, while only 20 percent said they support the concept, according to the poll from Democratic consultant and pollster Evan Roth Smith. Republicans and independents also balked at the idea, with fewer than 30 percent in both categories saying they support credit sales.

Tesla has already contributed to stagnating EV sales in California, which saw slightly fewer purchases over the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. While registrations of EV models by other makers jumped 14 percent, Tesla plunged by just over 21 percent, canceling out any gains.

Market experts say the results are in part due to the complicated nature of EV sales regulations. But they also point to a string of stories highlighting the fact that California’s rules undoubtedly helped turn Tesla into an EV behemoth. That’s because the state’s mandate requires automakers who don’t meet their sales requirements to buy credits from those that sell more, offering Musk’s company a lucrative revenue stream as the dominant player for over a decade.

“I think what it’s really about is hostility to Tesla and how they’ve been benefiting from this,” said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis and a former member of the California Air Resources Board. “They just see it as Tesla getting a boondoggle deal.”

Musk’s rise to the role of Trump’s top fundraiser, adviser and architect of the administration’s slash-and-burn of the federal workforce has made Tesla — his largest and most public-facing company — the target of Democratic outrage.

The eccentric billionaire has since hinted that he’ll step back from politics, as Tesla’s revenues have plummeted amid sales contractions in Europe and California, America’s biggest car market.

But Smith said the damage has already been done, and California officials now need to go on the offensive to create daylight between Musk, Tesla and the larger EV market.

“We have the president of the United States selling Teslas from the White House,” Smith said. “So if Democrats want to preserve a political environment where they can enact real climate policy around EVs, they have to be a little more courageous and play a similar game.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom has signaled he’s thinking about playing hardball. Newsom said in November that he’d push to restore state EV tax credits if the Trump administration does away with a $7,500 federal incentive, as the “megabill” passed by House Republicans last week would largely do. (It would cap benefits for companies that already have a large market share or have received substantial state support, i.e. Tesla).

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor, when asked about the tax credit proposal, pointed to a press conference last week where the governor said he’s still waiting to see what happens in the Senate and that lawmakers should assess impacts on the state budget.

Smith said now is the time for Democrats to dig in.

“I don’t think Democrats should be shy about this,” he said. — AN

JUST CHECK ZILLOW: Angelenos with federal disaster loans to repair and rebuild homes destroyed in the January firestorm are borrowing $310,000 on average — six times more than the average borrowed by other disaster victims nationwide between 2017 and 2024, according to an analysis by Tom Frank of POLITICO’s E&E News.

That’s partly because the Biden administration increased the maximum Small Business Administration loan for home repairs after a disaster to $500,000 from $200,000 in July 2023, the first such increase since 1994.

But it’s also because the Los Angeles recovery is just so expensive, with the January fires hitting high-end real estate and causing more damage than floods and high winds.

For comparison, other states have also seen their average disaster loans increase, but not by as much: In Florida, the average disaster loan in 2025 has been $65,000, compared with $47,000 from 2017 through 2024. In North Carolina, the average in 2025 has been $55,000, compared with $36,000 from 2017 through 2024. — TF, CvK

NOT SO LAST-RESORT: The growth of California’s insurer of last-resort, the FAIR Plan, has not slowed despite the rate hikes regulators are approving for other private insurers to entice them to do more business in the fire-prone state.

FAIR Plan President Victoria Roach told lawmakers in Sacramento today her organization, which is actually a pool of private insurers required by state law to provide back-up insurance, is on track to grow by 40 percent in number of customers this year and 60 percent in total value insured, which is similar growth to last year.

“The growth just keeps going,” said Roach. “It shows that the market is in an unhealthy state right now.”

What’s more, those newcomers aren’t just coming from high fire risk areas, which private insurers ditched first because of historic wildfire losses. They’re also now increasingly coming from what Roach called “normal suburban tract homes,” with the FAIR Plan’s highest growth this year so far in low fire risk areas. — CvK

PUT A FORK IN IT: California air regulators have settled a lawsuit with the propane industry that challenged a rule banning the sale of new gas-powered forklifts.

The Western Propane Gas Association announced the details of the settlement Wednesday, a day after the California Air Resources Board issued an advisory encouraging companies to voluntarily report their progress at phasing in electric forklifts, but saying the agency wouldn’t retroactively hold them responsible if the rule is enforced in the future.

CARB approved the rule in June, but never received an EPA waiver that would make it enforceable. State officials agreed in the settlement to not enforce the regulation before getting federal approval, to name a new deputy executive director to serve as a liaison for the forklift industry and to hold three public workshops with WPGA. — AN

PERMITTING SHERPA: The Trump administration has tapped a top energy and environment staffer for former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to lead its efforts to speed up permitting for major projects.

Emily Domenech is the new executive director of the Permitting Council, a federal agency tasked with modernizing the permitting and review process for large infrastructure projects. She was most recently a lobbyist at the firm Boundary Stone Partners, Kelsey Brugger reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Domenech told Kelsey her role is to “sherpa” major projects through multiple agencies, and pointed to mining projects as a top focus. The agency added 10 mining projects, some of them contentious, to its public dashboard of projects earlier this month. — AN

They’ve driven uncertainty to a peak, hurt our small businesses, and greatly raised the danger of a recession.
“The U.S. Court of International Trade agreed with what I and others have said for months: Trump was clearly abusing emergency authorities in ways not authorized by Congress to impose damaging tariffs on other countries, with obviously pretextual excuses.
Trump has threatened additional tariffs under this authority, known as Section 232, on semiconductor chips, copper, and pharmaceuticals, and he clearly is intent on abusing this power as well.
My bill, the Congressional Trade Authority Act, would prevent Trump from abusing this provision, return trade authority to Congress, where it belongs, and stop Trump’s trade war from doing further harm to the United States and the world.","Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), who serves on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade and chairs the New Democrat Coalition’s Trade Task Force, issued the following statement on a ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade vacating and permanently enjoining Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariffs on nearly every country in the world, including his “Liberation Day” tariffs and separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China:

“This ruling is a major victory for the American people, who have spent months under threat of a stupid, self-imposed economic disaster thanks to Donald Trump’s trade war. Trump’s tariffs have already raised costs on Americans, strained our alliances, hurt our credibility, and threatened the global economy. They’ve driven uncertainty to a peak, hurt our small businesses, and greatly raised the danger of a recession.

“The U.S. Court of International Trade agreed with what I and others have said for months: Trump was clearly abusing emergency authorities in ways not authorized by Congress to impose damaging tariffs on other countries, with obviously pretextual excuses. Abuse of power has been the most consistent theme of Trump’s presidency, including power grabs on immigration, elections, and the structure of the government itself, which are clearly illegal and unconstitutional. Such is the case here.

“It is important to note that while Trump’s broadest tariffs, which he imposed using authorities under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, were just blocked by the Court, but his sector-based tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, and auto parts are not affected by this ruling and remain in place. Trump has threatened additional tariffs under this authority, known as Section 232, on semiconductor chips, copper, and pharmaceuticals, and he clearly is intent on abusing this power as well. My bill, the Congressional Trade Authority Act, would prevent Trump from abusing this provision, return trade authority to Congress, where it belongs, and stop Trump’s trade war from doing further harm to the United States and the world.

They are an aggressive dismantling of the very policies that have powered America’s clean energy boom.
According to current estimates, repealing these clean energy tax credits would raise household electricity bills by more than $110 per year starting next year.
This triple-pronged assault—early sunsets, fast phase-outs, and regulatory barriers are designed not just to slow down our clean energy progress, but to reverse it.
Since 2022, over half of the new clean energy jobs have been created in these very districts.","The budget bill passed last week is a direct attack on the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax incentives—some of the most important tools we have to fight climate change, lower energy costs, and support job creation in rapidly growing sectors like solar, wind, and battery storage.

This bill would accelerate the expiration of nearly every major clean energy tax credit, which would be devastating to America’s energy transition. The proposal would end the tax credit for used electric vehicles and new EVs (with minor exceptions) by the end of 2025.

Residential energy efficiency credits would also disappear that year. The Clean Electricity Investment and Production tax credits would be phased down starting in 2029—three years earlier than planned—and completely eliminated by 2032 instead of 2035.

These aren’t minor technical changes. They are an aggressive dismantling of the very policies that have powered America’s clean energy boom. In 2024 alone, 93% of all new American energy supply came from solar, wind, and battery storage.

Gutting support for these industries just as energy demand is spiking—from the growth of artificial intelligence and crypto mining to expanded home electrification—would result in skyrocketing energy costs for families and businesses.

According to current estimates, repealing these clean energy tax credits would raise household electricity bills by more than $110 per year starting next year.

Worse yet, the bill would impose new restrictions so stringent that even the few remaining clean energy incentives would become inaccessible to most companies. This triple-pronged assault—early sunsets, fast phase-outs, and regulatory barriers are designed not just to slow down our clean energy progress, but to reverse it.

Clean energy investments are already creating jobs, lowering costs, and driving growth, especially in Republican districts. Since 2022, over half of the new clean energy jobs have been created in these very districts. Yet this bill would sabotage those economic gains in the name of short-term budget optics.

Fortunately, we can likely count on Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego to oppose this legislation in the Senate. In the House, Democratic Representatives like Greg Stanton are expected to fight against it.

However, it will be impossible to sway most AZ Republican representatives—except maybe Reps. Juan Ciscomani and David Schweikert.

Please take a moment to contact the offices of Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Rep. David Schweikert – even though the bill already passed the House. Urge them to oppose the cuts to clean energy if the bill comes back from the Senate with similar cuts.

The rally, which took place at the Million Dollar Staircase, was in support of the Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power (ASAP) Act (S.6570), legislation introduced by Harckham that sets a new target for “distributed”—i.e. rooftop and community—solar energy capacity. In addition to raising New York’s rooftop and community solar goal to 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, the ASAP Act directs the New York’s Public Service Commission (PSC) to implement common-sense reforms to the utility interconnection process in order to lower costs and accelerate deployment.

“The implementation of solar energy systems statewide, including in underserved, low-income communities, deserves as much support and encouragement as possible,” said Harckham. “New York’s clean energy momentum is an incubator for good-paying blue- and white-collar jobs and ramping up our gigawatt goals will reduce energy costs for residents, provide cleaner, healthier air to breathe as well, and benefit our communities in countless ways.”

New York must significantly scale up clean energy deployment to meet the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) mandate of 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and zero-emissions electricity by 2040. ASAP raises the state’s distributed solar target from 10 GW by 2030 to 20 GW by 2035, supporting residential, commercial, and community solar access across New York. The legislation also directs the PSC and NYSERDA to develop a plan to cost-effectively achieve the expanded solar goal.

State Senator Liz Krueger said, “Solar is leading the way in delivering a more affordable and sustainable clean energy future in New York. We should be doubling down on this winning bet by increasing our ambitions and getting rid of unnecessary costs that weigh down solar interconnections. I thank Sen. Harckham for his leadership on this important issue.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett, chair of the Assembly Energy Committee, said, “New Yorkers have worked hard to reach—and surpass—the state’s distributed solar goal. And this success is a testament to the important role that these renewable energy projects will play in helping to reach our CLCPA goals. It stands to reason that we should build on our successes and continue to support the distributed solar industry.”

New York’s solar industry employs over 15,000 workers statewide. Right now, the state is ahead of schedule toward its 10 GW by 2030 rooftop and community solar goal. Building an additional 10 GW of distributed solar over the next decade will boost New York’s “affordability agenda” with ratepayer savings and revenue for municipalities and school districts while doubling the number of solar industry jobs.

The ASAP Act requires reforms to the utility interconnection process in order to streamline processes and lower costs for ratepayers. The legislation requires electric utilities to report and publish their actual distribution upgrade costs, enabling greater accountability and fairer cost estimation for solar developers. It also creates guardrails to protect against cost overruns, providing market clarity and reducing price volatility and surprise charges.

In terms of streamlining solar projects, the legislation directs utilities to establish a self-performance option allowing qualified solar developers to complete certain interconnection upgrades themselves—lowering costs and avoiding utility bottlenecks.

Prevailing wage requirements in the bill will ensure solar expansion creates high-quality local jobs. Additionally, is meant to support local solar supply chains, electricians, and construction workers—stimulating green job growth and attracting private-sector investment in New York’s clean energy economy.

The ASAP Act also directs New York’s utilities to expand upon their successful flexible interconnection pilot programs, an innovative approach that leverages smart grid technology to integrate more solar and energy storage capacity while avoiding cost-prohibitive traditional distribution system upgrades.

Lastly, the ASAP Act promotes equitable access by requiring at least 35% of solar program investments benefit disadvantaged and low-to-moderate-income communities.

Noah Ginsburg, Executive Director, NYSEIA, said, ""At a time when clean energy is under attack at the federal level, state-level leadership has never been more important. Now is the time for New York’s legislature to double down on rooftop and community solar by passing the ASAP Act. Not only will the ASAP Act deliver billions of dollars of electricity bill savings to New York families and businesses; it will also provide revenue to rural communities and support more than 15,000 good local jobs in the solar industry.""

Michael Richardson, Co-facilitator, Third Act Upstate New York, said, ""Climate scientists have issued a clarion call that we must massively fast-track the buildout of renewable energy generation on all fronts if we are to avert critical tipping points in the climate system. The ASAP Act would do much to answer that call by advancing the buildout of rooftop and community solar and streamlining the utility interconnection process. What is needed at this time when federal support for solar is being erased is dynamic state leadership to continue and expand those solar programs that have proven success.""

Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director of Coalition for Community Solar Access, said, “We are proud to be gathering in support of the ASAP Act—the bold, necessary step New York needs to power our present and our future. By doubling the state’s distributed solar goal and cutting red tape, this legislation delivers on affordability, equity, and climate. It means lower energy bills for working families, thousands of good-paying local jobs, and a smarter, cleaner grid for everyone. We strongly urge lawmakers to pass the ASAP Act and keep New York at the forefront of clean energy leadership.""

Vincent Albanese, New York State Laborers PAC Director, said, “The New York State Laborers staunchly support the ASAP Act, legislation that will create union jobs and shepherd the state toward a clean energy future. It is vital this legislation pass in order to safeguard the future of solar in New York State, improve interconnection, protect the environment for future generations of New Yorkers and create career-track jobs.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/05/28/asap-press-conf-5-28-25.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 23:05:05.657321

The New Mexico Environment Department today filed a lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court in Las Cruces, asking the court to appoint an independent manager to oversee the daily operations of the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority, or CRRUA.

If granted, the order would effectively place the troubled water system into a status similar to receivership. The request comes after more than a decade of mismanagement at the utility, most recently demonstrated by repeated failed arsenic tests conducted by both CRRUA staff and NMED compliance and enforcement staff.

In addition to failing to properly treat its drinking water, CRRUA also failed to inform its customers of the dangerous levels of arsenic in their tap water — a violation that has been repeated for years.

“While the Environment Department has invested significant technical resources to assist CRRUA in fulfilling its duty to deliver safe and reliable drinking water, its failures continue to threaten public health,” said Environment Department Sec. James Kenney. “Today’s lawsuit and request to appoint an independent manager to oversee CRRUA signals a new approach in Environment Department efforts to protect the health of communities when they turn on their tap.”

NMED is seeking additional relief from the court, ordering CRRUA to:

Implement real-time arsenic monitoring

Distribute free arsenic test strips for all CRRUA customers

Provide an alternative drinking water source if arsenic levels exceed state limits

Conduct monthly public meetings

Pay civil penalties which, per state law, fund drinking water and wastewater utility operators for communities across New Mexico

Today’s filing aligns with NMED’s broader attitude towards water systems that habitually violate state drinking water regulations. In July 2024, NMED put 138 drinking systems across the state on notice, informing their owners that they had 15 days to submit a plan to resolve them.

However, many water systems remain out of compliance — including the City of Las Vegas and Cassandra Water System in Moriarity. If utility management cannot consistently provide safe, reliable drinking water to New Mexicans, the State will not hesitate to have them replaced.

Tu Le is Chief Executive Officer of Sino Auto Insights and Expert-in-Residence at TechTown Detroit.","Seven years ago, I wrote an op-ed for the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing titled ""The Driverless Duel."" I was living in China at the time —13 years in total — where I launched my consultancy, Sino Auto Insights, focused on mobility and transportation. In 2022, I moved back to Michigan.

In that piece, I made a prediction:

“Electric vehicles will be affordable to a large part of the market, and by 2025, people all over the world will have plenty of options at different price points.”

I was right. Kind of. In 2018, China sold 1.26 million New Energy Vehicles (NEVs—EVs + PHEVs). The U.S. sold just 361,000, mostly Teslas. By 2024, China’s NEV sales had skyrocketed to nearly 11 million. The U.S.? 1.5 million. China didn’t just lead — it lapped the field.

Fact: China became the world’s largest passenger vehicle market in 2009.

Fact: In 2024, nearly one in every two vehicles sold in China was an NEV.

Fact: Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said China’s car market will likely outsell the U.S. and EU combined in 2025.

China EV Inc. has spent the last seven years refining its EVs — more range, more tech, lower prices. A brutal price war — launched by Tesla in 2022 — is now in its third year.

At Sino Auto Insights, we’ve observed this transformation and distilled it into three phases defining the future of transportation: electrification, smartification and autonomation.

While the U.S. and EU are still slogging through electrification, China has sprinted into autonomation — where intelligent driving is rapidly becoming the norm.

Why the leap? Nearly every Chinese EV startup — and many legacy automakers including GM — now offer Level 2+ intelligent driving. And they’re all far cheaper than Tesla’s Full Self Driving.

Then came BYD’s seismic announcement: in February 2025, they made their Level 2+ system, God’s Eye, standard on 22 of their 28 models. That’s not a moonshot — that’s mass deployment. BYD will sell about 5.5 million cars in more than 100 countries this year. Most will have L2+ capabilities.

So how good are these systems? I’ve driven them. Extensively.

Last year, a friend and I drove an XPeng G9 from Beijing to Shenzhen — 1,200 miles in three days — using XPeng’s X-NGP intelligent driving for about 90% of the miles. This year, I drove a NIO ET5 with battery swapping tech from Beijing to Shanghai, relying on NIO’s NOP+ system, also for about 90% of the miles.

Both blew me away. Yes, they still require attention, but the tech is real, usable and evolving fast. When cutting-edge tech becomes mainstream, adoption isn’t linear — it’s exponential. Put it in 5 million cars? It explodes.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., we’re debating whether California should even be allowed to shape its own EV future.

I’m a Michigan boomerang — born here, spent years in the Bay Area and Beijing, and came back. Why? Family, yes. But just as importantly, to help position Detroit, Michigan and the U.S. as global players in the mobility revolution.

We need bold founders, daring startups, and relentless ambition. The legacy OEMs can’t do it alone. They need help. And Michigan — America’s mobility nerve center — has to lead.

If we’re ever going to catch up, let alone compete, we need to move into smartification and autonomation. Not next year. Not next decade. Now.

What are we waiting for?

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.
Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky?
The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency.
A power supply operating on the margins is a recipe for disaster.","A sudden blackout across Spain and Portugal earlier this month left 50 million people without electricity. While the cause of the outage is unclear, a leading culprit appears to be poorly integrated wind and solar resources. What’s clear is that, in an increasingly digital age, ensuring affordable and reliable power is more critical than ever.

The Spain-Portugal blackout came as U.S. power regulation authorities sounded an alarm about the safety of America’s electric grid and power supply. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky? And could Spain’s massive blackout happen here?

Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars. And when Americans crank up their air conditioners amid scorching summer heat, regional utilities must meet that hefty additional demand.

The problem is that there might not be enough electricity to go around.

The United States is suddenly using a lot more electricity than before. Electric vehicles, new manufacturing plants, and an exponentially growing array of data centers — which support the digital needs of cell phones, web browsers and AI systems — are gobbling up power. Power demand is growing so fast that, in the past year, NERC found America’s peak electricity needs grew by a staggering 10 gigawatts. That’s more than double the growth seen between 2023 and 2024.

Surging demand is also colliding with the remnants of a regulatory agenda that aimed to wipe out America’s coal power plant fleet and make it impossible to build coal and natural gas power plants. While the Trump administration has worked to undo this misguided regulatory blitz, grid operators have lost essential dispatchable power plants that work on demand. They’re now increasingly reliant on renewable power systems subject to the weather’s whims.

Because of this, NERC says that grid operators “face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

The greatest threat to grids nationwide will be heat waves when demand spikes. Windless, scorching summer days — and evenings when solar power disappears — could leave grids alarmingly short of supply.

NERC’s summer reliability warnings preview a growing risk. A few months ago, NERC warned in a long-term reliability assessment that more than half of North America faces a risk of energy shortfalls in the next five to 10 years as rising demand collides with the loss of traditional power plants.

The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie has observed that America is now “losing dispatchable generation at a pace that is not sustainable, and we are not adding sufficient equivalent generation capacity.”

The math is clear: The United States cannot afford to lose more existing power plants as we scramble to meet rising demand. The first place to start in addressing our looming power shortfalls is to ensure we don’t make our self-imposed hole deeper.

A power supply operating on the margins is a recipe for disaster. The Iberian blackout was a timely reminder of the risks we face. It’s time to heed the warnings of our grid operators and reliability regulators and rebuild solid, long-term electricity generation while there’s still time.

Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have eroded decades of progress, weakening the policies and safeguards we rely on to keep our air safe.

For more than 50 years, Earthjustice has used the power of the law to fight for the fundamental right to breathe clean air. The latest attacks against this right are unlawful, and we won’t back down.

Here’s what’s at stake, how it could damage public health, and what we are doing to fight back.

1. Slashing efforts to clean up car and truck pollution

Emissions from gas-powered vehicles are the largest source of carbon pollution in the country. And tailpipe pollution isn’t just a climate threat, it’s a public health risk fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory harm. Under the Clean Air Act, states hold the authority to pass stronger car and truck tailpipe pollution standards than the federal government to protect their residents.

Last week, Senate Republicans used an unlawful maneuver to overturn strong standards that a dozen states have adopted to protect their residents. The three state standards under attack – the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and the Heavy-duty Omnibus rule – can save thousands of lives a year from the heart and lung problems associated with tailpipe pollution. They also deliver billions in economic benefits and public health savings. In California alone, they’re slated to save the public an estimated $45 billion in health costs.

2. Freezing funds for EV charging stations across the nation

Despite the need to cut traffic pollution and modernize our transportation system, the Trump administration is withholding billions of dollars that Congress already allocated to build a national network of EV charging stations. Earthjustice has moved to join a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.

A national charging network is essential to accelerating the transition to zero-emissions, electric vehicles – a transition that is already underway as more Americans choose electric cars and trucks. Investing in this infrastructure is not only critical to ending harmful tailpipe pollution, but also keeping the U.S. economy competitive as the rest of the world goes electric. That’s why Congress promised billions for states to build out this infrastructure.

By freezing the money, the Trump administration is stalling climate progress and violating several laws, including the Constitution, which gives Congress — not the White House or the executive branch — the power of the purse.

3. Letting thousands of the worst polluters turn off clean air protections

Congress just let thousands of top polluters turn off technologies that capture or limit some of the most dangerous air pollutants.

Some 1,800 industrial facilities — including chemical plants, refineries, and pesticide manufactures — will be allowed to reclassify themselves as “minor polluters.” That frees them from the obligation to monitor, control, or report the most dangerous emissions. The facilities can shut off controls for seven of the most hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, dioxins, and PCBs, which are linked to birth defects, developmental harm, and cancers. These chemicals accumulate in the body and pose severe risks to pregnant women, infants, and children.

4. Want to pollute? Just email the White House

The EPA announced in April that companies can simply send an email to the Trump administration asking for permission to pollute on grounds of “national security.” Within weeks, Trump’s EPA granted exemptions to dozens of coal-fired power plants, allowing them to release more mercury, arsenic, and acid into our air. The administration is also considering granting exemptions to bypass clean air rules for eight additional polluting industries; rules that currently limit emissions of cancer-causing chemicals like ethylene oxide, chloroprene, and benzene.

The administration is using the “national security” excuse to stop the imminent retirement of a deadly coal plant in Michigan. According to the Clean Air Task Force’s Toll from Coal dashboard, the J.H. Campbell plant that the administration wants to extend is responsible for 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks every year. On top of the drastic health consequences, customers in the region will also have to pay more on their utility bills to cover the costs to keep the plant operational.

We will defend the right to clean air

This nonsensical wave of clean air attacks means more unregulated deadly pollution, dirtier air, and worsening public health. It doesn’t make economic sense, it isn’t in line with the direction the rest of the world is moving to build the clean infrastructure of the future with better air, and it isn’t what voters wanted.

But this isn’t the first time Trump has tried to dismantle clean air protections. When the first Trump administration delayed critical clean air safeguards, courts found these moves unlawful thanks in part to lawsuits by Earthjustice, workers, and communities.

We’re ready to go back to court to stop this Trump administration from gutting needed health protections and to ensure everyone’s right to breathe clean air.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2203455863_crop_2k.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 21:02:00.600930

(NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, issued a statement of support in response to the White House’s release of a series of executive orders focused on speeding up approval and adoption of advanced nuclear, reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), restoring the domestic nuclear supply chain, and overhauling testing and licensing processes for advanced nuclear.

As part of the announcement, Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte joined President Trump at the White House alongside other industry leaders. The event marked a historic moment in the administration’s effort to secure America’s energy future and unleash American energy dominance.

“These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

The executive orders direct agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to operate more effectively as both customers and enablers of new energy technologies. Oklo supports efforts to empower the DOE, DoD, and NRC to use existing authorities more efficiently and to prioritize performance-based, mission-aligned reviews.

Oklo is developing U.S. invented fast fission power plants capable of recycling used nuclear material and converting it into clean, firm power. The company is the only advanced nuclear developer with an active site use permit from the DOE, a fuel award through a competitive DOE and Idaho National Laboratory program, and active regulatory traction with the NRC for its first commercial power plant.

The executive orders also emphasize the importance of using existing feedstock of domestic nuclear fuel feedstock to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience. Oklo’s fuel award for its first core load is sourced from used nuclear fuel material from the successful Experimental Breeder Reactor II program. This DOE fast reactor demonstration operated for decades and proved the viability of both fast reactor technology and recycling used fuel. The company’s power plants are designed to use either fresh High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium or recycled used nuclear material.

The executive orders reaffirm the United States’ strategic commitment to leading the world in advanced nuclear energy, a vision Oklo is advancing through its demonstrated technology and efforts to enable commercial deployment at scale.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-05-28 21:01:52.246679

That’s because a policy that would ban companies with ties to China from green energy tax credits has moved through the U.S. House earlier this month.

Gotion is a Chinese tech company. Their American subsidiary has plans to build an EV battery plant in Green Charter Township, located in Mecosta County. The $2 billion plant received over $175 million in state incentives.

The NO GOTION policy passed within the Big Beautiful Bill Act. It was introduced by U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Caledonia). The act would ban companies aligned with the Chinese government from taking advantage of green tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Moolenaar supports ending the mid-Michigan Gotion project, arguing Gotion's public ties to the Chinese Communist Party are a national security threat.

In a statement, Moolenaar touted the legislation saying the bill would ensure Michigan tax dollars “never go to Gotion and other companies affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party.”

Last year, a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing stated “Gotion is partially subsidized through government funding supplied by the People's Republic of China.”

The legislation currently sits in the Senate.

Skepticism of the Gotion deal has some bipartisan support. The original NO GOTION Act was cosponsored by three Democratic members of the House.

In addition, then-Representative Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) introduced a bill that would give the Committee on Foreign Investment more power to review sales to China-based companies. That bill had a Senate version backed by Democratic U.S. Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow. Neither version passed.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While it has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, the legislation in its current form poses significant implications for the solar industry. PVH is encouraging developers to prepare accordingly.

""Time is of the essence,"" said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA. ""We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects' economics.""

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project's total capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been incurred before any new legislative changes take effect. By procuring tracker products now, developers can lock in the current, more favorable incentive structure. PVH USA's readiness to support up to 5GW of Safe Harbor product can help developers meet these CAPEX thresholds quickly, mitigating risk and preserving the long-term viability of their projects.

""PVH's scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,"" Bitar said. ""We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.""

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country's largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. To date, the IRA is cited with helping to generate 330,000 new clean energy jobs and more than $70 billion in private investment in the American economy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

About PV Hardware: PV Hardware (PVH) is a solar tracker manufacturer and provider of innovative solar tracking solutions for the global solar energy market, including solar trackers, fixed structures and SCADA systems.

The Senate now has the BBB, and with it the chance to ensure we don’t wait another 20 years.","In my latest Forbescolumn, I detail how the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) had the potential to revolutionize federal regulatory policy. But last-minute changes in the House stripped away provisions that could have both pruned existing rules and reshaped how regulations are made and managed henceforth. The Senate now takes up the BBB.

The original BBB featured reforms that would have strengthened Congress’s oversight of costly rules, particularly through tweaks to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). These changes would have enhanced disclosures about individual rules, and incorporated elements from the long-proposed Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act to secure congressional accountability over rulemaking.

Instead of simply allowing Congress to disapprove of notice-and-comment rules after enactment as the CRA now does, the original BBB aimed to require legislative approval for certain “major” rules—specifically those that increase government revenue (the BBB, after all, is a budget bill). This potentially could have added a powerful check on agencies imposing fees and penalties (with caveats, however; there was some nagging potential for progressives to exploit the change).

Another provision called for a comprehensive five-year sunset review of existing rules, such that rules would expire without Congress explicitly approving their continuance. The BBB also proposed addressing the so-called midnight rules concerns. Presidents tend to rush through rules in the final days of their terms; the BBB would have addressed that by allowing Congress to bundle such rules for disapproval.

Additionally, the bill directed the Government Accountability Office to perform a comprehensive estimate of regulatory costs.

Unfortunately, given the prospect of Senate procedural hurdles, these reforms were quietly dropped just prior to the BBB’s passage with single-line deletion.

However, as I noted in Forbes, hope isn’t lost. The final BBB incorporated a $100 million funding boost for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through 2028, earmarked to “improve regulatory processes and analyze and review rules” issued by several federal agencies. While the explicit congressional approvals, sunset mechanisms, and other innovations originally envisioned are now gone, this infusion still gives OMB an opportunity to streamline and modernize regulatory review.

Senate lawmakers now have a chance to reformat the foregoing provisions to avoid parliamentary fatality. Given the fusion of spending and regulation in modern America, bills like the BBB should increasingly tackle not just fiscal matters but also incorporate the overt and hidden costs of regulatory burdens. Proposals like a regulatory budget to cap the overall cost of new regulations could complement spending reforms and unleash economic growth—and may also be a better fit as far as parliamentary concerns go.

As the authorized agency to implement LEU and HALEU procurement, the Office of Nuclear Energy at DOE must be appropriately staffed and empowered to develop the necessary programs for unlocking advanced nuclear energy.","This blog is part of a series that explores the federal policies and actions needed to deploy next-generation geothermal, sources of nuclear energy (both fission and fusion), and carbon capture and storage – technologies the Trump administration indicated as priorities on Earth Day. The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

Momentum is rapidly growing for advanced nuclear energy in the U.S. At the opening remarks for the 2025 United States Regulatory Information Conference in March, U.S. Senator and Chairman for the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, Shelley Moore Capito, held up to the audience a gift from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Chairman David Wright – a solid white hat with the bold words “MAKE ATOMS GREAT AGAIN.” And in April, the Trump administration stated its support for advanced nuclear as part of a larger energy strategy for America to lead globally “in both energy production and environmental innovation.” Just one month later, the Trump administration issued four executive orders declaring that “it is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people.” The administration’s move is in line with public opinion. The most recent polling suggests a lopsided majority of Americans favor new nuclear energy.

CATF has long advocated for the advancement of nuclear energy as one of a suite of technologies critical to achieving a zero-emissions future at an affordable cost – and has been working specifically to transform the nuclear energy ecosystem to unlock economies of scale. Many of the policies in the orders are encouraging and are necessary to deploy new projects, but the federal government is still missing the mark on scaling advanced nuclear energy in the United States. In fact, Congress and the administration’s actions are misaligned with the administration’s stated goals of energy security, independence, and global leadership in nuclear technologies.

If the administration and Congress are serious about regaining U.S. leadership in nuclear energy and quadrupling American nuclear energy capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050, they must provide sustained and enhanced support for incentives and deployment programs at several agencies, including tax credits for clean energy development and generation and multiple offices within the Department of Energy (DOE).

Advanced nuclear energy can support American energy independence, provide reliable, affordable, and clean power, and create jobs.

Advanced nuclear energy is uniquely positioned to meet growing U.S. electricity and energy demand driven by data centers, expanded manufacturing, and the electrification of transport, heating, and industry. State legislatures across the U.S. continue to recognize advanced nuclear energy’s unique ability to support grid reliability and decarbonization goals, with more than half of states across the country pushing supportive policies for advanced nuclear energy deployment. These policies include the formation of early-stage multi-state coalitions, programs for scaled labor and supply chain development, repeals of decades-old moratoria on new nuclear power plants, and funding for feasibility studies to help support siting projects, among others.

This has sent a positive signal that has led to utility, industrial, and technology companies like Dow, Amazon, and Google signing commercial deals in Texas, Pennsylvania, and other states. Such agreements total nearly 17 gigawatts of additional U.S. nuclear capacity by 2040. The problem is very little of that capacity is currently under development, and industry alone is not able to overcome the economic barriers to reach efficient, cost-effective deployment. Meanwhile, Canada is leading G7 countries by providing financial support to Ontario Power Generation and moving forward with four advanced nuclear reactors that will create 18,000 Canadian jobs and add up to $500 million annually to Ontario’s economy. The U.S. nuclear industry is looking to the American government for strong and predictable leadership before undertaking new projects.

Bolstering the domestic advanced nuclear energy sector requires preserving existing incentives and greater collaboration to scale nuclear energy deployment.

A truly bold agenda would include:

Enhancement of front-end cost reduction federal mechanisms. The tech-neutral clean electricity investment and production tax credits under sections 48E and 45Y are essential for first- and early-of-a-kind projects that are aiming for early-to-mid 2030s deployment. While House Republicans were able to improve tax credits for new nuclear in a final version of the budget reconciliation bill sent to the Senate, the December 31, 2028 commence construction deadline will inhibit most new project construction. These credits, including provisions allowing the transferability of credits, should be extended through 2040 to support grid scale deployment of advanced nuclear. The 45X advanced manufacturing credit should also be extended through 2040 to assist in manufacturing capabilities for new projects, and Foreign Entity of Concern provisions for all three credits should be made workable to accommodate a global nuclear supply chain where limited domestic capabilities exist. Additionally, Congress must protect and enhance authority for the DOE’s Loan Programs Office to enable sufficient staffing, institutional management, and funding to support new nuclear development, and allow for blended federal financing with other DOE grants. This is especially true if, as set forth in one of President Trump’s nuclear executive orders, the administration plans to deploy 10 large, advanced nuclear reactors with LPO support.

Programs to support structured “orderbooks,” not isolated projects. While the administration’s plan for isolated project demonstrations across Department of Energy and Department of Defense sites, including the Generation III+ solicitation program, is exciting, it misses the core strategy required for scaling: replicating a standard plant design. Every successful nuclear buildout – domestically and globally – has involved deployment of multiple standardized units. A clear pipeline of projects sends a strong signal to scale up supply chains. Additionally, building out multiple units of the same design, thereby developing an orderbook of projects, enables cost reductions through replication and “learning by doing.” To achieve such cost reductions for advanced reactors, industry needs support for orderbooks, such as integrated project delivery (IPD) and risk management tools to lower up-front uncertainty from cost overruns. Congress can also expand existing DOE loan and grant programs to support orderbooks of advanced reactors.

Create a federal cost overrun insurance facility and other options to de-risk early builds. A cost insurance mechanism should feature tiered risk-sharing between project sponsors, states, and the federal government to protect against cost overruns. Access to cost overrun insurance would be granted only if certain conditions are met, including competitive selection, proven integrated project delivery, payment of a premium, and state support via Public Utility Commission (or equivalent) tariffs, offtake commitments, or cost ladders. In addition to an insurance mechanism, complementary options could be considered, like a Federal Power Purchase Agreement that uses a “contract-for-differences” model or directly procures a portfolio of nuclear projects through Build-Own-Transfer agreements, could help absorb first-of-a-kind risk. The federal government could also act as a co-developer alongside state or private entities, which is a model that was successfully used to deploy UAE’s Barakah project, as well as the Palisades restart in Michigan.

Scale the nuclear supply chain and make fuel available. Federal leadership is essential to help catalyze deployment of new reactors as supply chains mature. DOE and the national laboratory system can help centralize best practices in cost, project, and supply chain management; offer and support workforce training; and enable easier research and development through simplified Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). Additionally, uncertainty about fuel availability for new reactor projects poses a significant risk. The previous administration enabled short- and long-term fuel supply development opportunities for both low- and high-assay enriched uranium fuel cycles, and now, the Trump administration must ensure these investments are anchored. As the authorized agency to implement LEU and HALEU procurement, the Office of Nuclear Energy at DOE must be appropriately staffed and empowered to develop the necessary programs for unlocking advanced nuclear energy.

Efficient and effective reactor licensing. Since the first Trump administration, the NRC has made progress towards a more modern regulatory organization by updating its regulations, optimizing its staffing, and implementing best practices to license new light water reactor and non-light water reactor technologies. Major pieces of legislation, including NEIMA in 2019 and the ADVANCE Act in 2024, have provided the NRC with specific legislative direction, additional hiring authority, and new statutory language to drive its modernization while maintaining its role as an independent agency focused on protecting the public and the environment. Now is not the time to undo years of regulatory reform through short-term cuts to NRC staffing or sudden reorganizations that will create long-term agency deficits, undermine the growing social license for nuclear energy, and harm interagency coordination with DOE, DOD, the U.S. Department of State, and other key agencies. Long-term modernization of the NRC, much like any critical infrastructure project, requires deliberate planning, continued investment, and robust oversight to make sure that both near-term and long-term licensing activities can be completed effectively, efficiently, and predictably. As part of ADVANCE Act implementation, the NRC is also updating regulatory processes that support rapid deployment of new nuclear energy based on reactor standardization and expedited environmental reviews. This should not be delayed by a wholesale review of NRC regulations.

Overhaul of the U.S. nuclear technology export offering. To deliver on the administration’s vision for U.S. energy dominance, the federal government must sharpen America’s competitive edge by reaching competitive parity with other global exporters, fostering interagency collaboration, and strengthening the capabilities of key diplomatic and financial agencies. In addition to the Section 123 Agreements encouraged by the executive orders, this includes establishing a national interest account to prioritize advanced nuclear fission export projects through the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM), raising its default cap, and modernizing EXIM’s mission to complement an international advanced nuclear fission deployment strategy. Raising the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation’s (DFC’s) contingent liability and loan size cap, as well as easing its country restrictions, would allow for a broader impact across the world. The administration’s call to accelerate the export of nuclear technologies comes on the heels of the reintroduction of the International Nuclear Energy Act (INEA) by the Senate, which would support the establishment of an office to coordinate on a secure and responsible civil nuclear export strategy, establish financing relationships, and promote regulatory harmonization, among many other things.

A strong, wholesale change in spent fuel policy. This will require a bottom-up approach in which the federal government works with states and communities to identify conditions, locations, and timelines for establishing facilities to store Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF). Multiple geologic repository pathways should be explored, including consolidated interim storage. This will build public trust and enable the long-term viability of high-level waste disposal, as seen in other SNF repository programs across the world.

Scale the workforce necessary to support new nuclear deployment. To carry out the administration’s vision for reinvigorating the nuclear workforce, nuclear workforce development programs should be prioritized and coordinated between sufficiently funded and staffed Departments of Labor and Education and state governments. Each new nuclear project is not just a leap toward bolstering domestic carbon-free energy production, but also a powerful economic engine for job creation – employing thousands during construction and providing high-paying, long-term careers in communities nationwide. From reactor operators to cybersecurity specialists, welders to policy analysts, the nuclear workforce is as diverse as it is skilled, offering opportunities for veterans, tradespeople, and graduates alike.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23111852/FusionBlog-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 20:09:47.932756

President Trump signed executive orders last week to boost production of nuclear power, an energy source with a complicated history in the U.S.

After World War II, nuclear was heralded as the future of American energy. Then, the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 marked a turning point and solidified opposition. In the last two decades, a dozen reactors in the U.S. have closed and only three new ones have come online.

But, as William Brangham reports, the site of America's worst nuclear accident may now be the site of its rebirth. It's part of our series Tipping Point.

William Brangham:

They sit quietly now, perched on an island in the middle of the Susquehanna River, four giant cooling towers, two nuclear reactors, and one terrifying chapter in American history.

Robert MacNeil, Former Anchor, ""PBS NewsHour"": Good evening. We're sorry to interrupt your regular programs, but we have been waiting all evening to go to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

William Brangham:

Back in 1979, a combination of mechanical failures and human error caused the radioactive core of one of the site's nuclear reactors to start overheating. For nearly a week, local communities around Harrisburg were on edge, fearing a full meltdown or explosion.

While the worst-case scenarios didn't happen, small amounts of radioactive material were released. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it had negligible effects on health and the environment, but a lasting impact on the nation and the industry.

William Brangham:

Bryan Hanson is chief generation officer for Constellation, the energy company which owns the other reactor on Three Mile Island, known as Unit 1.

We talked in its control room, which still looks very much like it did decades ago. Unit 1 was closed at the time of the accident for refueling. And while Unit 2, where the accident occurred, never reopened, Unit 1 restarted in 1985, a controversial move covered by the ""News Hour.""

Bryan Hanson:

Gas in Pennsylvania is very cheap, so gas plants were being built. We had to make that tough decision to say, we're going to have to shut you down because it's not economical anymore. It was our responsibility to the shareholders to do so.

William Brangham:

But, in the years since, nuclear's fortunes have started to turn around, including the understanding that, given the realities of climate change, nuclear emits no greenhouse gases and, unlike solar and wind, it can produce energy 24/7.

Last September, Constellation announced it would invest over $1.5 billion to restart the Unit 1 reactor. But the real reason Three Mile Island is coming back to life is because Microsoft, the tech company, has pledged to purchase the equivalent of all the energy that Three Mile Island would produce carbon-free for the next 20 years in order to meet the company's climate goals.

William Brangham:

Microsoft says it wants to be carbon-negative by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it pollutes. That's an even steeper challenge, given that Microsoft is also plowing billions into building new energy-intensive data centers for A.I. and other computing work, hence the deal with Three Mile Island.

So, absent Microsoft's involvement, would we be talking about reopening this place?

William Brangham:

While many of these projects are still years from fruition, it will also take years to get Three Mile Island back online.

So even though this thing looks like it is decades-old, this button, that dial, you can be confident that this is going to work like it was brand-new?

Bryan Hanson:

If you look at the robustness of the design, you look at the material condition, the craftsmanship, there's nothing that prevents these plants from operating for 100 years.

M.V. Ramana, University of British Columbia: I don't think we should think of this as actually dusting off an old plant.

William Brangham:

Physicist M.V. Ramana is a professor at the University of British Columbia and the author of the recent book ""Nuclear Is Not the Solution."" He says there's still no permanent solution for what to do with radioactive waste.

He argues accidents at Three Mile Island, at Chernobyl and at Fukushima prove these plants pose a grave risk, and that spreading the know-how about nuclear energy increases the risk of nuclear weapons spreading.

But, practically, he says nuclear plants take too long and cost too much to build.

M.V. Ramana:

The environmental community is not paying enough attention to the feasibility of using nuclear power. The current estimates of how much it is going to take to restart the plant are underestimates, and this is not new for the nuclear industry. They have always underestimated stuff.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/PoweringUp-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 23:05:19.405582

Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state.","After trying and failing to carve out more exceptions to Wyoming’s longstanding ban against storing radioactive nuclear power plant waste earlier this year, lawmakers will take another swing at gaining support for the idea.

They’re particularly focused on clearing the way for Radiant Industries, which proposes manufacturing microreactors and “temporarily” storing their spent, radioactive fuel at a site near the towns of Casper and Bar Nunn.

After Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” went down in flames during this year’s legislative session, lawmakers on the joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee called in experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to answer questions about evolving safeguards and the industry’s track record.

In nearly 40 years of “dry cask” storage in the United States, “we have had zero release of radiation or radioactive material to the environment,” Idaho National Laboratory Used Fuel Management Department Manager Daniel Thomas told lawmakers last week in Casper.

“Similarly, in transportation, we have moved [spent nuclear] fuel for several million miles on rail, on road, by boat, with zero accidents,” Thomas testified.

Those assurances, along with evolving federal safeguards, rang true for Lander resident William Almas, who offered his perspectives to the committee via Zoom.

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation. But that’s not the point, he noted. Such expert testimony won’t be, and it shouldn’t be, enough to convince others in Wyoming.

Health and safety concerns are valid, Almas said, particularly in a state that doesn’t yet host nuclear waste. All the pamphlets, slide decks and expert testimony in the world don’t matter a lick, Almas suggested, unless state leaders initiate a long conversation with residents that, ideally, is moderated by a “third party.”

“A key factor contributing to the lack of success of these projects is the failure of the community to reach consensus on the safety and the value of the projects,” Almas told the panel. “The facts must be clearly presented and discussed by an impartial third party, moving both the proponents and opposition in a forum for discussion.”

Lawmakers on the panel nodded and noted the suggestion. The panel directed the Legislative Service Office to draft another version of SF 186 for further consideration when it meets again in July.

Radioactive hurdles

After decades of public opposition, Wyoming lawmakers tweaked statutes in 2022 to allow for storage of spent nuclear fuel — so long as it is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state.

The move was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer. The “advanced” nuclear reactor will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2030, will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

Wyoming’s legal pathway for TerraPower to store its spent fuel on site is contingent upon the company receiving approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will oversee the plant’s operation and radioactive waste storage.

While SF 186 would have made another exemption to the state’s ban by allowing microreactor manufacturers such as Radiant to store spent fuel, House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have opened the door to commercial operations to potentially take the waste from nuclear power plants from all over the country. Both bills failed this year. Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here. State statute prohibits a commercial high-level radioactive waste facility, whether it’s spent fuel from a power plant from another state or a microreactor built in the state, as Radiant proposes, unless the federal government establishes a permanent repository.

That’s not likely to happen anytime soon, according to federal officials. It will take an act of Congress to resume efforts to establish one at Yucca Mountain, or anywhere else, according to Idaho National Laboratory’s Thomas, who worked for more than a decade on the Yucca Mountain project.

“Yucca Mountain has been defunded and is not being pursued,” Thomas said. If Congress were to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to resume the work, he added, “I would say that we are probably four or more decades off.”

That leaves Wyoming to consider whether to make another exception to its nuclear waste storage ban.

What’s at stake

The Wyoming Energy Authority and Wyoming Business Council are eagerly pursuing companies interested in reinvigorating the state’s uranium mines, hoping to launch a mining-to-reactor industry that becomes an integral piece of domestic energy security.

Having a nearby supply of refined uranium ore would give a leg up to companies like Radiant and BWXT Advanced Technologies that want to build portable microreactors here and deploy them to industrial customers throughout the nation and world, according to the companies. BWXT, with a matching grant from the state, is already building a nuclear reactor component supply chain among existing fabrication shops here. Though BWXT is still exploring whether to set up an actual microreactor manufacturing shop in Wyoming, Radiant proposes a manufacturing facility just outside of Bar Nunn. Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.

“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance,” Radiant Director of Operations Matt Wilson told lawmakers. “But when you look at other countries — Russia, China — they are well ahead of us when it comes to projects not just in the pipeline, but coming on every year. And that’s not just on the advanced reactor side. That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.”

Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state. More public education and engagement are needed, he said, as well as details from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about containment measures should there be an “episode” at a nuclear facility.

“I would recommend that we reach out and ask for testimony so that we can have all sides of a picture before we make decisions on things,” Knapp said.

GM Backpedals on EVs

The Wall Street Journal reports GM Invests in V-8 Engines as It Backpedals on EVs

General Motors has abandoned a plan to pump $300 million into electric-vehicle motor production at its upstate New York plant and will instead invest $888 million to make the latest V-8 engines.

Since the EV announcement two years ago for its Tonawanda plant, electric-vehicle sales have slowed, prompting GM and other carmakers to walk back investment plans for the technology.

The company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant and makes Tonawanda its second propulsion plant to produce the sixth generation of V-8 engines.

The engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs, use new combustion and thermal management innovations to improve performance while reducing emissions, the company said.

The investment includes new machinery, equipment, tools and facility renovations, and builds on GM’s work to boost its manufacturing facilities in recent years, including a half-billion-dollar investment in its Flint engine plant in 2023, the company said.

Nay Sayers Were Right

The nay sayers were right, at least in the US, and for now.

That’s the group I have been in. The US is just not ready for mass EV adoption.

China is another matter.

EV Sales in the US

In the first quarter of 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for approximately 7.5% of total new vehicle sales in the U.S., according to a report from Kelley Blue Book. This represents a slight increase from the 7% share seen in the same period the previous year.

EV Sales in China

In 2024, approximately 50% of all car sales in China were electric vehicles (EVs), including both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). China’s EV market share is significantly higher than that of the US and Europe. In 2024, China also accounted for nearly two-thirds (65%) of all electric cars sold worldwide.

Long-Term

I expect battery technology to improve, costs to improve, charging times to drop, and eventually there will be more charging stations.

Once infrastructure is in place sales will take off. Just don’t expect EVs to do much of anything for the environment.

One can blame Trump for the short-term but the blame really goes to Biden’s preposterous targets.

The US infrastructure was not ready, charging times too long, EPA rules too preposterous, and charging stations too few.

The house budget bill will roll back tax credits. But if you have to subsidize something, it’s really not affordable.

In due time this will change. Meanwhile, neither Biden nor Trump will allow China’s cheap EVs into the US market, slowing adoption.

The problem: The “sky’s the limit” increases in energy costs for our home. We were fossil fools. Yes, we were getting a Faustian bargain, but at what price tomorrow? Global warming is here and now. Here’s our story.

Energy – the projections, estimated and actual

Average Massachusetts energy bills increased by about 10% in 2025 versus 2024. Projected electricity will cost $209,000 for an average Bedford home spread over 25 years1. That’s enough for a down payment on a home or pay for higher education. Our contractor, Sunergy, projected our 25-year savings to be $78,193 – averaging $3,128 per year savings.

Production?

Sunergy projected 1,013 kWh annual output. Actual for April-December 2024 was 8,100 kWh, or about eight times what Sunergy projected per year.

What happened to the excess?

Most went to consumption – an average of five megawatts annually. Any monthly net balance from long sunny days was banked to the grid and used in leaner times like winter months when solar days are short and consumption is high. In between it’s available to consumers like you. More supply means relatively lower cost – especially in peak demand times.

Even with recharging our all-electric car and electrically powering our heat pump, at an estimated 12MWh annualized electricity production, due to ongoing conservation efforts we are still producing significantly more than we consume. A bonus? Our April 2025 HVAC bill dropped from $113 per month to $30 per month because it is powered by free clean and green electricity. We use Bedford Community Choice 100% green for backup.

What did we do about our energy use pre-conversion?

We checked off these boxes:

Utilized the Mass Save conservation and insulation program

Shifted EV recharging to local stations

Used 100% renewable energy for our electrical power

Installed energy efficient light bulbs

Upgraded our furnace from 85% to 98% efficiency

Ensured annual furnace checkups

Installed smart thermostat technology

Lowered the setting of the water heater thermostat

Financial incentives

Federal funds. “The solar tax credit allows households to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes. This will be available until the end of 2032, at which point it will drop to 26%.” 2, 3

The projections and costs- estimated and actual. Our estimated payback with incentives is 7 years.

Our federal income tax reduced by $13,935 and our state income tax by $1,000.

Pollution abatement: In the last 8 months of 2024 (post solar installation period), not counting carbon emissions, or our additional clean car refueling savings, we have saved 12,600 pounds of carbon by converting to solar panels and a heat pump (July 2024). That is enough carbon to match the weight of three small pickup trucks each year.

Moral imperative. Massachusetts Climate initiatives.

“The Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030 (2025/2030 CECP) provides details on the actions the Commonwealth will undertake through the next decade to ensure the 2025 and 2030 emissions limits are met.” The goals of the initiatives are for a 50% carbon reduction from the 1990 level by 2030 and net zero emissions by 20504. Our climate-friendly actions are consistent with, if not ahead of, Massachusetts targets.

Legacy: Are we making our planet a little healthier every day? Yes!

Is our future to continue our past as fossil fools? No longer!

It’s obvious the 35% goal for 2026 will be postponed a couple of years, with the 100% EV mandate a mirage on the road to nowhere.","Buckle up for the demolition derby between Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Trump over California’s EV mandates. Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta sued Trump after he backed a Senate vote to kill the state’s mandate to ban sales of all new gas or diesel-powered passenger cars and light trucks by 2035.

Zero-emission vehicles include all-electric, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen vehicles. Intermediate goals are 35% ZEV sales by 2026 and 68% by 2035.

But according to the California New Car Dealers Association’s 2025 Auto Outlook Report for Q1, just 20.8% of new cars were ZEVs – a decline from 22% in 2024. To meet that 35% goal next year, ZEV sales would have to increase by 68%.

“Dealers sell what customers want to buy,” said Robb Hernandez, the association’s chairman and president of Camino Real Chevrolet. “No mandate can force consumers to choose otherwise.”

Tesla still held the biggest EV market share at 43.9%, but that was down from 55.5% in Q1 of 2024. The problem: “Californians are giving the cold shoulder” to Tesla “and controversial owner Elon Musk.” Registrations “show a massive decline of 15.1%.”

Part of the decline stems from the anti-Musk protests since his Department of Government Efficiency began cutting government waste. A neighbor drives a Tesla sporting a bumper sticker: “I BOUGHT THIS BEFORE / WE KNEW ELON WAS CRAZY.”

Last November, Newsom proposed extending the state’s expired EV tax credit– except for Tesla. So far, no state extension. But Consumer Reports found as of May 7 car buyers “can still benefit from the federal EV tax credits as well as rebates from local utility providers.”

It’s going to be hard to meet mandates if you attack the top EV company. Meanwhile, Musk has moved on from DOGE. The Wall Street Journal headlined May 27, “Angry Elon is Back. That’s Good for Tesla.”

Another neighbor drives a plug-in BMW. I asked him how he liked it. “Great,” he said. “But my garage has nowhere to plug it in. So I just use gas.”

Let’s turn to politics. Newsom leaves office in 19 months. There’s no reason for the next governor to continue his signature issue. We’re already seeing action in that direction in the campaign for his replacement.

The Los Angeles Times reported May 26, “Villaraigosa, despite climate credentials, pivots toward oil industry in run for governor.” That’s former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. He’s taken $176,000 from the oil industry. And he said of recent oil refinery shutdowns blamed on Newsom’s hostility to the industry, “I’m not fighting for refineries. I’m fighting for the people who pay for gas in this state.”

On March 24 Villaraigosa told NewsNation Now he supports the 100% mandate by 2035. He added the state built 100,000 charging stations the last 10 years, but “needs about 2 million in the next 10 years.” That summarizes the dream – and the reality.

Locally, the nearly 1,300 new car dealers in California will pressure the next governor and the Legislature to postpone the unworkable mandates.

When the violent attacks on Tesla hit in March, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Tesla’s Fremont factory and its 20,00 workers, posted on X, “There is zero tolerance for acts of vandalism against Tesla.” If new car dealers start going bankrupt from being unable to meet the EV mandate, sending tens of thousands of workers into unemployment lines, an old political quip comes to mind for Democratic politicians, “When they feel the heat, they’ll see the light.”

On May 25 the New York Times reported Democrats are spending $20 million on a new concept, “Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.” But what do men want, an EV SUV, or a Ford-350 Super Duty chugging gas at 14 mpg?

(WJBF) – State Senator Harold Jones and local clean energy leaders are speaking out about how those cuts could impact the funding of clean energy programs and what that means for the community.

Programs like the Weatherization Assistance Program and Solar for All help lower utility costs for some Georgia families. They also promote workforce development, home energy savings, and address climate issues. Georgia State Senator Harold Jones is opposed to those cuts. He says they’ll raise costs and cut jobs.

“These are not buzz words about clean energy or weatherization,” said State Senator Harold Jones. “These things actually matter to people. Actually, puts more money in their pockets. Also improves the economy and the environment. All of that is connected to actually having a better society.”

Nicole Lee is a business owner who has seen how weatherization and solar power help low- to moderate-income families save hundreds of dollars in utility costs thanks to these programs.

“Just to see the widespread of ones solar as well as weatherization work in in multiple states and seeing the impact that it helps in LMI communities is astonishing, and so I’m hoping that you know bipartisan funding is able to be passed so that these programs can continue to exist,” said Nicole Lee, Owner of Be Smart Home Solutions.

Paige Brockmeyer is part of the Citizens Climate Lobby in Augusta and wants to encourage people to continue reaching out to state and federal lawmakers and encourage them to vote against cuts to these programs. She says the health of Georgians depends on it.

“The more particulate matter that’s in the air from burning fossil fuels, the more respiratory problems we have. So, that’s kind of at one level, and at another level, you have events like Hurricane Helene,” said Paige Brockmeyer, Volunteer Group Leader, Citizens Climate Lobby Augusta.

Unitil’s energy storage projects represent 6.2% of the statewide target.","The EDCs, also the investor-owned utilities (IOUs), in the state are Eversource, National Grid and Unitil.

Eversource and National Grid have switched between serving the most customers in the state depending on the year.

In 2017, DOER communicated an energy storage procurement target of 200MWh, signed by then-Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Lt Governor Karyn Polito, secretary Matthew Beaton and commissioner Judith Judson.

As explained by the law firm Foley Hoag in a recent company blog post, the current Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey, signed a new, expansive energy legislation in November 2024, which expanded the procurement of energy storage systems to 5,000MW by 31 July 2030.

Of the total 5,000MW, the act designates 3,500MW for mid-duration storage (more than 4 hours and up to 10 hours), 750MW for long-duration storage (more than 10 hours and up to 24 hours), and, if commercially feasible at a reasonable cost, 750MW for multi-day storage (more than 24 hours).

Existing storage systems can take part in the procurement.

The DOER and the EDCs’ joint draft RFP, which is not yet approved, is the first of at least four planned solicitations for securing 5,000MW by 31 July, 2030.

This filing is a staggered procurement schedule, outlined as follows:

1,500MW of mid-duration storage (environmental attributes) by 31 July, 2025 (the subject of this RFP).

1,000MW by 31 July, 2026.

1,000MW by 31 July, 2027.

The remaining capacity (approximately 1,500MW) by 31 July, 2030.

An Independent Evaluator (IE) report of the draft RFP found it likely to attract competition and provide a cost-effective result for ratepayers.

The IE also suggested enhancements for future procurements, such as giving stakeholders more time to provide input, considering the addition of distribution-connected projects and examining regional collaboration with other states to maximise benefits and lower costs.

DOER and the EDC proposed issuing the RFP on 31 July 2025, but that date will depend on the DPU issuing an order.

As of 31 December 2024, Massachusetts’ utilities have made considerable progress in achieving the goals set out by the legislation.

Eversource had approximately 4,546MWh and 1,244MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

National Grid had approximately 8,826MWh and 1,059MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

These both represent over 100% of the previous statewide energy storage target of 1,000MWh to be achieved by 31 December, 2025.

Unitil had approximately 62.2MWh and 20.7MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

Unitil’s energy storage projects represent 6.2% of the statewide target.

Massachusetts is a part of the regional transmission organisation ISO New England, which also includes Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.

According to ISO New England, Massachusetts leads the region in demand growth and in both existing and proposed electric generating capacity.

Traders said Freeport LNG in Texas might reduce output and they pointed to forecasts for less demand this week than previously expected.

On its last day as the front-month, gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 19.4 cents, or 5.7%, to settle at $3.214 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since May 19.

The contract's price was highly volatile, up as much as 3% and down as much as 7% during the session. Traders cited low volumes on expiration day for the June contract. The market only traded about 2,400 front-month contracts on the NYMEX, far below the year-to-date daily average of roughly 165,000.

Futures for July, which will soon be the front-month, were down about 4.6% to $3.57 per mmBtu.

Next-day prices at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana traded around $3.20 per mmBtu. Low next-day Henry Hub prices have kept pressure on futures in recent weeks with spot contracts trading below front-month futures every day since late April.

Analysts have said that so long as spot prices remain far enough below front-month futures to cover margin and storage costs, traders should be able to lock in arbitrage profits by buying spot gas, storing it and selling a futures contract.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to 105.0 billion cubic feet per day so far in May, down from a monthly record of 105.8 bcfd in April.

On a daily basis, output was on track to drop to a preliminary two-month low of 103.7 bcfd on Wednesday, down from 105.4 bcfd on Tuesday. Analysts have said preliminary data is often revised later in the day.

Energy traders said output reductions this month were primarily due to normal spring maintenance on gas pipes, including U.S. energy firm Kinder Morgan's 2.7-bcfd Permian Highway from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast. Kinder Morgan said it exchanged a turbine at the Big Lake compressor station from May 13-26.

Energy firms usually work on gas pipes when demand is low in the spring and autumn.

LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will slide from 96.1 bcfd this week to 95.7 bcfd next week. The forecast for this week was lower than LSEG's outlook on Tuesday, while its forecast for next week was higher.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big LNG export plants operating in the U.S. fell to 15.1 bcfd so far in May, down from a monthly record of 16.0 bcfd in April.

The LNG feedgas decline this month was mostly due to maintenance at Cameron LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Louisiana, Cheniere Energy's 3.9-bcfd Corpus Christi under construction and in operation in Texas and Cheniere's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana, and a few brief unplanned reductions at Freeport LNG's 2.1-bcfd plant in Texas, including most recently on May 28.

Looking ahead, energy traders said they expect LNG feedgas to remain below April's record high in June with Cheniere planning about three weeks of maintenance on a couple of liquefaction trains at Sabine around June 2-23.

Additionally, the EO directs the NRC to undertake several rulemakings that must be proposed within nine months and finalized within 18 months.
The order directs all applicable agencies to expeditiously grant required export approvals.
Further, the DOE, NRC and OMB must develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacity to meet projected domestic demand.
Conclusion Taken together, the EOs chart an ambitious course to jump-start the U.S. nuclear energy industry.","President Donald Trump signed four separate executive orders (EOs) on May 23, 2025, intended to result in a quadrupling of U.S. nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts (GW) by 2050, all while strengthening domestic fuel cycle infrastructure and achieving deployment of demonstration reactors as soon as next year. Three of the EOs seek to reform the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) while leveraging the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to streamline the licensing and construction process of new reactors, with a particular focus on advanced reactors. These EOs also seek to aid deployment of U.S.-developed reactor technology abroad. The fourth EO relates to improving fuel cycle infrastructure but largely calls for additional study and reports rather than immediate action. Each of the EOs is discussed further below in detail.

Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The first of the EOs aimed at speeding reactor deployment orders the NRC to undergo reorganization while also overhauling its regulations with respect to reactor licensing. An underlying purpose of this EO is to direct the NRC to act in accordance with its revised mission statement following the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024 (ADVANCE Act) to not unnecessarily burden energy deployment while still maintaining its safety mission.

Specifically, this EO directs the NRC to work with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to undertake a reorganization to align with the purpose of focusing NRC resources primarily on new reactor licensing. The order directs the NRC to undertake reductions in force while acknowledging that certain functions, namely new reactor licensing, may increase in size. It also directs the NRC to create a team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations discussed further below. The order also directs the NRC to reduce the personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) to the minimum necessary to meet its statutory obligations. The ACRS was created pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) and must review safety studies and facility license applications and advise the NRC on hazards of proposed or existing reactor facilities and the adequacy of proposed reactor safety standards.

Additionally, the EO directs the NRC to undertake several rulemakings that must be proposed within nine months and finalized within 18 months. Each of these rulemakings will be subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and great care must be taken to ensure any resulting rules and licensing reviews conform to applicable statutory requirements.

Most notably, the NRC is directed to establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of reactor licenses and other reactor licensing activities. This shall include a deadline of no more than 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type and no more than one year for a final decision on an application to continue to operate an existing reactor, with tolling allowed only in the event of an applicant failure. To facilitate quicker timelines, the NRC is directed to streamline its hearing process and revise its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-implementing regulations to reflect the 2023 amendments from the Fiscal Responsibility Act and Unleashing American Energy EO. The NRC's NEPA-implementing regulations currently direct NRC staff to ""take account of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality published November 29, 1978"" and have not been updated to reflect the 2023 statutory amendments.

The NRC is also directed to reconsider the reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and instead implement determinate radiation limits. Despite previous acknowledgements by the NRC that the LNT model cannot be validated at low doses, during its last extensive multiyear review of LNT beginning in 2015, the NRC ultimately concluded in August 2021 that there is not yet enough evidence to rescind the LNT's assumptions. This recent review could present a litigation risk to any renewed effort to rescind the theory as the basis of radiological protection regulations.

Other actions directed by the EO include:

establishing fixed caps on hourly fees for NRC reviews

establishing an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that have already been approved by the DOE or DOD, focusing only on new risks not evaluated by those agencies

establishing a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors and considering whether certain reactors or components may be built under general licenses

establishing stringent thresholds for when the NRC can demand changes after construction is underway

reducing burdens in the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) and reactor security rules and focusing on credible risks

revising reactor safety assessments to focus on credible, realistic risks

reconsidering the license for which a renewed license remains effective – currently, renewed licenses for commercial reactors typically extend for 20 years but are capped by the AEA at 40 years

Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the DOE

The second EO aims to increase the role of the DOE in deploying new reactor designs while reducing the NRC's role in this process. This order specifically seeks to facilitate construction of ""qualified test reactors,"" defined as advanced reactors that are determined by the DOE to have sufficiently demonstrated from a financial backing and technical development standpoint that they may feasibly be operational within two years from the date of a substantially complete application. The order makes a blanket finding that any such reactors ""over which the Department exercises sufficient control and that do not produce commercial electric power"" are subject to the exemption from NRC licensing contained at 42 U.S.C. § 2140.

The EO establishes requirements for the DOE to facilitate qualified test reactor development both within and outside the national laboratory system. The DOE must take action to ensure its regulations and policies enable deployment of a qualified test reactor within two years of an application.

The order also requires establishment of a pilot program outside of the national laboratories and ""shall"" approve at least three pilot reactors with a goal of achieving criticality in each of the reactors by July 4, 2026.

Lastly, the DOE is directed to streamline its NEPA-implementing regulations and to identify potential categorical exclusions and alternative review procedures as allowed by NEPA.

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

The third EO seeks to leverage the military's energy needs to deploy new reactor technologies and to facilitate exports of U.S.-developed nuclear technologies abroad. First, the order directs the DOD through the Secretary of the U.S. Army to create a program of record for using nuclear energy to power both military installations and operational needs and deploy a nuclear reactor at a domestic military base or installation by Sept. 30, 2028. The order also directs the DOD to work with the DOE and U.S. Department of State to identify new regulations, legislation and international agreements needed to carry out this program.

Next, the order directs the DOE to take action to designate artificial intelligence (AI) data centers that are located at or operated in coordination with the DOE and related electrical infrastructure as critical defense facilities and to deploy advanced nuclear reactor technologies at one or more DOE sites. The order sets a goal of deploying the first reactor at a DOE site no later than 30 months from the date of the order (November 2027).

The order also directs the DOE to identify uranium and plutonium within its inventories that may be useful for nuclear fuel and to release at least 20 metric tons of high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for use by the private sector at a DOE-owned or controlled site for the purpose of powering AI infrastructure. In connection with the goal of ensuring long-term supply of HALEU, the order directs the DOE and DOD to site, approve and authorize the design, construction and operation of privately funded nuclear fuel recycling, reprocessing and reactor fuel fabrication technologies at DOE and DOD sites.

With respect to exports of U.S.-developed nuclear technologies, the order directs the State Department to pursue at least 20 new agreements under Section 123 of the AEA and to renegotiate existing agreements set to expire in the next decade in order to facilitate transfer of nuclear technologies abroad by private parties. The order directs all applicable agencies to expeditiously grant required export approvals. The order also includes a number of provisions to finance and otherwise support development of U.S. nuclear technologies abroad, including financing through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Export-Import Bank.

As with the other EOs, this order directs applicable agencies to leverage categorical exclusions to minimize the impact of NEPA reviews when carrying out the order's goals.

Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base

The final EO seeks to improve domestic fuel cycle infrastructure, including uranium enrichment and conversion, as well as waste recycling and disposal infrastructure. This order further seeks to fund nuclear power plants and develop a robust nuclear workforce. This EO includes a mix of immediate actions and additional studies and reporting on the substantial changes that would need to be made to U.S. nuclear waste statutory and regulatory regimes to achieve the EO's lofty aims.

The primary report directed by this order is a joint report by the DOE, DOD, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), due within 240 days (Jan. 18, 2026) that covers various subjects around planning for and developing infrastructure to recycle, reprocess and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. This report is intended to set new policy and to identify regulatory and legislative changes needed to affect such policy.

Further, the DOE, NRC and OMB must develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacity to meet projected domestic demand. The DOE must also halt the surplus plutonium dilute and dispose program and establish a program to make surplus plutonium available for use as nuclear fuel. The DOE, in consultation with the DOD, must update the DOE's excess uranium management policy to align with the goals of the order, while factoring in the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapon stockpile. The DOE, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), must seek to enter voluntary agreements with nuclear energy companies under the Defense Production Act to procure low-enriched uranium and HALEU, including as needed by the U.S. government for national security purposes.

The DOE is also directed to prioritize work, particularly in the Loan Program Office, that will facilitate 5 GW of power uprates to existing reactors and ensure that 10 new large reactors are under construction by 2030. The DOE shall also consult with the DOD about the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear plants to support military microgrid applications. The DOE is also directed to prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear reactor technologies.

Lastly, the order directs the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Labor to take various actions to prioritize nuclear education pathways and apprenticeships within existing programs and establish new training programs. The DOE is also directed to increase access to national labs for students studying nuclear engineering and related fields.

Conclusion

Taken together, the EOs chart an ambitious course to jump-start the U.S. nuclear energy industry. The orders focus primarily on rapid deployment of advanced nuclear reactors while also providing support and further study for other parts of the fuel cycle, including uranium conversion and enrichment along with waste reprocessing and recycling. Although the orders note current U.S. reliance on foreign sources of uranium and some of the proposed NRC reforms will benefit all stakeholders in the nuclear fuel cycle, direct support for domestic uranium recovery is notably absent from these orders.

These EOs build on the long-standing bipartisan support for nuclear deployment, including passage of the ADVANCE Act of 2024 and the HALEU Availability Program first authorized in the Energy Act of 2020. Ultimately, the success or failure of the goals of these orders will depend on how the orders are actually implemented. Some of the required actions are already in progress following last year's passage of the ADVANCE Act. Other actions will need to be started from scratch, and the applicable agencies will need to take great care to comply with applicable substantive statutes and the APA. Carefully crafting actions to survive potential litigation may create tension with the aggressive deadlines for action in the orders.

If we want to keep the Texas Miracle alive, we must eliminate the unnecessary roadblocks that slow down industrial investment and job creation.
Granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells will send a clear message that our state is open to innovation, ready to lead, and committed to supporting industries that power our economy.","For decades, our state’s economic growth, job creation, and industrial strength has been dubbed the “Texas Miracle.” Texas has remained the best place in America to grow a business by being forward looking, streamlining regulations, and committing to energy leadership.

One of the most immediate economic development priorities for Texas is securing state permitting authority over Class VI wells, a process known as “primacy” which will allow the state of Texas to efficiently permit infrastructure used to inject and store carbon dioxide deep underground. The US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) recently took a meaningful step forward by signing a Memorandum of Agreement outlining the state’s plan for administering its carbon storage programs, but additional milestones still lie ahead, including an opportunity for the public to express their comments.

As consumer demands for low-carbon products grow across the globe, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a safe, proven technology that will allow existing Texas industries to utilize domestic natural gas to introduce new products and adapt to these changing trends.

However, companies investing in these technologies have been stuck in a slow and unpredictable federal permitting process. About one-third of all permits pending at EPA today are from Texas, but staggeringly, only one permit has been approved in the last four years.

Texas has succeeded because we believe in letting Texans solve our state’s challenges. If Texas is granted primacy, it can take control of its own permitting, utilize its own resources to accelerate investment in a responsible manner, and ensure Texas remains a place where manufacturers can advance cutting edge technology. Primacy would allow the RRC to use its expertise to regulate underground injection with the same rigorous safety and environmental standards as the EPA. The RRC understands our state’s unique geology, workforce and industries and can fairly apply stringent safety and environmental protections.

Accelerating carbon capture and storage can also play a key role in strengthening the state’s power grid, which is important to businesses and residents. Natural gas power plants provide at least half of our electricity, ensuring grid stability and providing on-demand electricity. By streamlining permitting, Texas can accelerate the deployment of CCS at these plants, allowing them to continue providing affordable and reliable power while reducing emissions, especially as energy demands grow.

If Texas is granted Class VI primacy, it will unlock billions of dollars in private investment and create thousands of high-paying jobs in engineering, construction, and operations. These projects won’t just benefit the energy sector — they will strengthen the entire industrial supply chain. From equipment suppliers to logistics companies, the ripple effects of CCS investments will support businesses across Texas.

Every month that goes by means delayed investments, lost jobs, and a weaker industrial base. That’s why we were proud to have recently joined 32 other leading community organizations across the state in urging the EPA to approve Texas’ application for Class VI well primacy without further delay. West Virginia, Wyoming, North Dakota, and even Louisiana have successfully received primacy and there is no reason for Texas to continue waiting, especially when we have the experienced staff and resources to do the job efficiently and responsibly.

If we want to keep the Texas Miracle alive, we must eliminate the unnecessary roadblocks that slow down industrial investment and job creation. Granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells will send a clear message that our state is open to innovation, ready to lead, and committed to supporting industries that power our economy.",https://fortworthinc.com/downloads/7786/download/Oil%20Adobe%20Stock.jpeg?cb=3d65ac56af0f985bce2f823de3906c98&w=1200,N,,2025-05-28 21:01:56.615295

Trump just ordered ...,Graig Graziosi,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-coal-plant-michigan-executive-order-b2759528.html,"President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan slated to close at the end of the month open through the end of summer.
A Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that it plans to ""comply with the Department of Energy order.""
The executive order falls in line with Trump's previously stated support of coal burning as a primary energy source for the U.S. power grid.
In April, he signed another executive order ramping up U.S. coal production.
“I call it beautiful, clean coal,” Trump said at the time.","President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan slated to close at the end of the month open through the end of summer.

The J.H. Campbell Plant in West Olive, Michigan was scheduled to close on May 31, but will now remain open after the Trump administration's Department of Energy warned of a heightened risk of blackouts during the summer.

The DOE warning stressed the need for caution with ""critical grid security issues"" in the Midwest, particularly in advance of the ""high electricity demand expected this summer.""

As annual temperatures continue to climb due to human driven climate change via the burning of fossil fuels, energy demands to power air conditioning and refrigeration have also increased.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release on Friday.

He said the Trump administration would not ""sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.""

The DOE's warning comes in response to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that found the part of the country serviced by Midcontinent Independent System Operator — an electric grid operator for the central U.S. — is at an ""elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.""

That report specifically points to the scheduled closing of some power plants as a major contributing factor to the potential energy shortfalls and increased risk of power loss, The Hill reports.

While Wright insists that keeping the plant open will help keep energy prices from rising for Americans, Dan Scripps, the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, argued that the executive order was ""unnecessary"" and would ""increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.""

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Scripps said in a statement.

He said that the MSPC will continue to ""work with MISO and Consumers Energy to assess the impacts of the DOE's order and work to limit unnecessary cost increases imposed as a result of this order.""

A Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that it plans to ""comply with the Department of Energy order.""

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO. The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” the spokesperson told The Hill.

The executive order falls in line with Trump's previously stated support of coal burning as a primary energy source for the U.S. power grid. In April, he signed another executive order ramping up U.S. coal production.

“I call it beautiful, clean coal,” Trump said at the time. “We’re ending Joe Biden’s war on beautiful, clean coal, once and for all.”

His insistence on using coal has drawn the ire of climate change experts and environmentalists who warn that coal power will only harm Americans in the long run.

Gina McCarthy, a former head of the Environmental Protection Administration, previously told The Independent that ""there is no such thing as clean coal.

“Just as Trump’s tariffs are hitting Americans’ wallets, his administration is wasting taxpayer dollars to prop up an expensive, dangerous, and dirty industry when we have abundant, cheaper, better, and safer clean energy,"" she said.

Environmental experts have also called the Trump administration’s plan to remove the caps on greenhouse gas emissions at power plants “deeply concerning.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is drafting a plan to end all limits on greenhouse gases emitted by coal and gas-fired power plants, The New York Times reported this week.

The agency argues that the greenhouse gases emitted by these plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” according to a draft plan reviewed by the newspaper.

However, fossil fuels are the “single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the U.S.,” according to Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund. The United States is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas producers —second only to China.

The new rule is “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law,” Patton said.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/27/20/Coal_Plant_Michigan_19600.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-05-28 18:13:41.801442

The projects include 440 MW of solar and 106 MW of battery storage at the retired coal-fired Edwards power plant in Bartonsville and 287 MW of storage at the retired coal-fired Joppa power plant in Joppa, according to filings Vistra made at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The projects have been in development since at least 2022.

“The petitioners have been diligently pursuing the development of these resources, which can make an important contribution towards meeting resource adequacy needs in Illinois and the [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] region,” Vistra said in its requests at FERC.

However, supply chain constraints, growing demand for electrical equipment spurred by Inflation Reduction Act incentives and rapid load growth have significantly increased the time it takes to get critical equipment, according to Vistra.

“These supply chain constraints have been compounded by uncertainty and disruption arising from recent increases in import duties and continued uncertainty regarding the future trajectory of U.S. trade policy,” the Irving, Texas-based company said.

Vistra has signed contracts reserving capacity with an equipment supplier for needed transformers, but the supplier expects it cannot deliver them until the fourth quarter of 2029, according to the filings.

Also, Vistra’s suppliers expect it will take three years to deliver breakers for the projects rather than the 12 to 18 months that typically have been required to obtain the equipment, the company said.

Vistra has interconnection agreements that set an Aug. 31, 2028, commercial operation deadline for the Joppa battery project and a Dec. 31, 2028, deadline for the Edwards project. The company asked FERC to extend the deadlines by two years.

“The petitioners will not have the certainty necessary to move forward with procurement and construction unless they have certainty that their [generation interconnection agreement] will not be terminated for failing to meet the existing deadline for achieving commercial operation,” Vistra said.

Vistra said its waiver requests meet FERC’s standards for issuing waivers from grid operators’ rules, including that the waiver does not have undesirable consequences, such as harming third parties.

For months, gearheads have been buzzing over the idea of an electric muscle car that could still bark like a HEMI. Dodge’s Charger Daytona SRT Concept had promised just that: an EV muscle car with futuristic styling, neck-snapping acceleration, and an artificial exhaust note dubbed the “Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust.” But now, the future of that vision is looking a lot dimmer.

What Went Wrong?

Dodge had boldly stepped into uncharted waters with their concept. The Daytona SRT wasn’t just another electric car—it was supposed to be the new face of American muscle. It carried retro styling cues, was set to feature an 800-volt Banshee powertrain, and even had simulated gear shifts to mimic the feel of a traditional performance vehicle. To put it plainly, they were trying to make an EV that could scratch the same itch as a V8. That’s no small task.

But then reality hit. Despite the buzz, production delays, mounting costs, and shifting consumer interests started to weigh the whole thing down. Meanwhile, traditional ICE models like the Charger and Challenger were continuing to move units right up until their final days. Enthusiasts weren’t quite ready to say goodbye to combustion—especially when electrics came with a higher price tag and questionable sound effects.

The Pivot Back to Combustion

Instead of going all-in on the battery-powered muscle machine, Stellantis has pivoted. Reports indicate that while the Charger nameplate will live on, it’ll likely debut with internal combustion engine options first—possibly powered by the all-new Hurricane inline-six—and plug-in hybrid variants down the road. The full-electric version is no longer front and center. It’s not completely dead, but it’s been pushed to the back burner for now.

Was the EV Charger Too Much, Too Soon?

This about-face raises a lot of questions. Was the EV Charger simply too ahead of its time? Did they underestimate the loyalty to the V8? Or was the idea of a synthesized exhaust and fake gear shifts just a bit too much to stomach for the average muscle car fan?

For PowerNation viewers and muscle car diehards, the move comes with mixed emotions. On one hand, it’s a win for those who aren’t ready to trade the rumble of a big American engine for the whine of an electric motor. On the other, it represents a sort of identity crisis for the brand that once prided itself on being loud, bold, and unapologetically old-school.

Performance Isn’t Going Anywhere

It’s clear Dodge still wants to evolve. Their messaging has been about “eMuscle” and the future of performance, but it seems that future will now be reached with a more gradual shift—one that includes hybrids and high-output six-cylinders before full EVs take over.

What This Means for the Industry

What does this mean for the broader performance world? If Stellantis—the company that owns Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler—is scaling back its EV ambitions, it might be a sign of a larger trend. EVs are still coming, but the road may be longer and bumpier than expected. Consumers want performance, but they also want sound, feel, and heritage. And right now, battery-powered cars aren’t checking all those boxes.

The V8 Lives to Fight Another Day

So while the electric Charger isn’t entirely gone, it’s taking a back seat for now. And that means there’s still time to enjoy the roar of combustion, build that dream HEMI project, and hold onto the golden age of muscle—at least for a little while longer.

For those of us who still get goosebumps from a cold start or a third-gear pull, that’s not bad news at all.",,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:25.539427

Lately on the Hill

Tax Bill Passes the House

The reconciliation package continues its trip through the congressional process. After officially squeaking by the House on May 22 with a 215 to 214 vote, it now faces its next hurdle—the Senate. After an all-nighter debating specifics of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , (the “Bill”, or the “House bill”), there were arguably three topics that tipped the scales for passage: the state and local tax (SALT) cap, clean energy credits, and Medicaid.

The SALT Caucus and House Freedom Caucus both presented obstacles to getting the bill through, both of which were largely appeased with adjustments included in the Manager’s Amendment issued late in the evening of May 21. In the passed version of the Bill, the SALT cap was raised to $40,000 beginning in 2025, but this amount phases out (to $10,000) for those with income of $500,000 or more. Further, the cap and the phase-out threshold increase 1% annually from 2026 until 2033 and then become permanent at 2033 levels.

Previously, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was quoted late in 2024 that clean energy credit changes would be made “with a ‘scalpel not a sledgehammer.’” However, what came out of the House for certain investment and production credits were major changes for the clean energy industry. The most commonly claimed credits—Sections 45Y and 48E—now end after December 31, 2028. What’s possibly most significant, however, is that projects must begin construction no later than 60 days after the Bill’s enactment. Beginning construction is, however, often out of the hands of clean energy developers and investors who depend on things like permits and utilities to get their projects started. This means that projects that were planned and funded years ago may now be scrapped.

The Top Ten: What’s in the Bill?

While far-reaching in scope, the tax provisions in the Bill affect businesses, individuals, tax-exempt entities, and clean energy investors alike. Here are some highlights of what could be seen as 10 of the Bill’s most high-impact proposals:

1) The “Big Three”

Three separate topics were rolled into one adage: 100% bonus depreciation, allowing immediate expensing (rather than capitalization) of domestic research and development expenses, and reverting the §163(j) calculation to using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In the Bill, 100% bonus would be implemented for property acquired after January 19, 2025 and placed in service before January 1, 2030, and research and experimentation (R&E) expensing would also be temporary through 2029 but allowed only for domestic R&E incurred after December 31, 2025 and before December 31, 2029. The §163(j) change will likewise be in effect through 2029.

2) Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction Permanence & Increase

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) implemented the §199A deduction to benefit pass-through entities (PTEs) and their owners in the wake of a decreased corporate rate. The Bill proposes not only to make the QBI deduction permanent, but also to increase the deduction from 20% to 23%. The Bill also modifies phase-in limitations and other computational items, while indexing certain amounts for inflation.

3) Pass-Through Entity Taxes

With the TCJA’s introduction of the SALT cap (the limitation of how much an individual can deduct for state taxes they paid), many states implemented PTE “workarounds.” This allowed partnerships and S corporations to pay state income taxes on behalf of their owners and ultimately circumvent the SALT cap’s deduction limitation. The House bill does not fully disallow this dynamic for all entities, but it does for non-specified service trades or businesses. These entities are service businesses like accounting firms, law firms, or doctor’s offices.

4) Manufacturing Business Topics

100% Depreciation for Nonresidential Real Property Used in Manufacturing

Bonus depreciation is currently only available for assets with lives of 20 years or less. Practically speaking, this carves out real property, aka buildings, and qualifies things like equipment or furniture and fixtures. The House bill would flip the script for those in the business of manufacturing, producing, or refining products (tangible personal property), allowing them to immediately expense not only their equipment but now also their buildings. Much of the administration’s rhetoric (especially with tariffs) has focused on onshoring or growing American manufacturing. This largely aligns with that school of thought—immediate expensing for one of a business’s largest assets could be an incentive to set up shop in the United States.

Gross Receipts Threshold for Small Manufacturing Businesses

Currently, businesses of any type are considered to be “small businesses” if their gross receipts are below $25 million. The Bill would increase this $25 million threshold to $80 million for those considered to be “manufacturing taxpayers”—those businesses that derive substantially all of their gross receipts from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualified tangible personal property produced or manufactured by the business. The impact of this designation could be huge—it permits the entity to be cash basis, exempt from uniform capitalization rules (UNICAP), exempt from §471 inventory accounting rules, and possibly most importantly not subject to §163(j) interest limitation.

5) Excess Business Loss (EBL) Limitation on Noncorporate Taxpayers

Currently, if a business’s deductions exceed its income (plus a threshold amount), individual business owners can’t fully take the resulting loss on their tax returns. Instead, the disallowed amount is converted to a net operating loss (NOL) carryover to future years without further limitation. The House bill would make this limitation permanent and implement a new cumulative limitation for losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.

6) No Tax on Tips, Overtime, & Social Security

Although three separate provisions are in the bill, they have been largely discussed in one breath since their introduction by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. The Bill provides deductions for “qualified tips” for those working in specific occupations, and for “qualified overtime” (excluding highly compensated employees) through December 31, 2028. The Byrd rule in the Senate reconciliation process restricts any bill from affecting Social Security directly. Thus, to accomplish “no tax on Social Security,” the House bill has proposed a new $4,000 deduction for individuals age 65 or over (with phaseouts starting for those with $150,000 adjusted gross income if married filing jointly (MFJ)). This deduction is also temporary through 2028.

7) Clean Energy Credit Changes

As noted previously, Republican House members were looking for ways to fund the various proposals in the Bill. One of their largest “pay-fors” ended up being clean energy credits. While many credits were simply repealed, others had their expiration dates adjusted, the option for transferring (or “selling”) the credit repealed, and/or had provisions that would exclude the involvement of certain specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities. Most of the credits on the chopping block were related to electric vehicles (and their chargers) or residential tax credits.

8) TCJA Individual Impacts

Most of the TCJA provisions being extended or made permanent by the House bill relate to individual taxpayers. Some notable items include:

Permanence of modification of individual, estate, and trust rates

TCJA-increased standard deduction would be made permanent, with a temporary increase of $2,000 MFJ (differing amounts for other filing statuses) through 2028

Personal exemptions permanently disallowed

Miscellaneous itemized deductions permanently disallowed

TCJA-increased alternative minimum tax (AMT) permanent

9) Tax-Exempt Entity Applicability

In addition to clean energy and other initiatives, the adjustments applicable to tax-exempt entities are considered revenue raisers that help the House meet the scoring parameters set by the budget resolution. The 21% excise tax on excess compensation now applies to any employee. Further, the maximum excise tax rate has increased on both net investment income of private foundations and on certain private colleges.

10) International Tax

For tax years 2026 onwards, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) rates were increased to 10.878% and 13.335% respectively. Further, the House bill increases the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) rate to 10.1% but maintains the current method for utilizing credits in the calculation.

What’s Next?

The difficult question to answer is what approach the Senate will take. Will it largely adopt the House-passed version, or craft its own approach and pressure the House into accepting it? There are already some indicators of variations between House and Senate opinions. Last week, the Senate passed a separate bill on the “No Tax on Tips” issue, which makes the deduction permanent (instead of temporary per the House bill).

Tariffs continue to make headlines as Trump threatens a 25% tariff on certain smartphones if they are not manufactured in the United States. Currently, smartphones are on the listing of exemptions from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs announced earlier this year. In addition, although Trump was previously in negotiations with the European Union, he stated that he is “recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” Over the weekend, however, he extended the deadline for that tariff to July 9, 2025 to allow for further negotiations.

Vivek Shastry is a senior research associate at the Center on Global Energy Policy in the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.

Millions of American families are struggling to afford their energy bills. This situation could worsen as electricity prices — particularly in the Northeast — face potential hikes due to reciprocal tariffs from Canada. As energy prices fluctuate, and federal assistance programs face potential cuts, cities, states and utilities must take proactive steps to ensure that their most vulnerable residents can keep their lights on and homes heated and cooled.

Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in his introductory remarks after swearing in, shared a troubling statistic: one in 10 Americans had received a utility disconnection notice in the past year. In his new role, one of his goals would be to “shrink that number to zero” by making energy more abundant and affordable. By flooding the market with fossil fuels again, the price of electricity and gas would decrease. However, the primary federal program to tackle energy affordability — the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — does not fall under Secretary Wright’s purview.

LIHEAP is funded through the Department of Health and Human Services, and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly terminated the entire staff running the $4 billion LIHEAP program. In 2023, more than 7 million Americans received assistance through LIHEAP. Despite its importance, LIHEAP reaches only 17% of eligible households, leaving a gaping hole in the energy safety net. Without it, those relying on it to meet energy needs will be at grave risk. Some have called for the modernization of LIHEAP, but these days the imperative must be to simply preserve it. Ongoing cuts to the program would likely push millions of Americans to experience the ill health effects and fatal consequences of energy insecurity.

Historically, states have relied on LIHEAP as the primary source of energy bill assistance. However, with rising demand and uncertainty about its future, local and state governments, along with utilities, must take greater action to tackle the growing energy affordability crisis.

State-level solutions

States have at least three avenues they can exploit to improve energy affordability. First, states can supplement energy assistance through their own budgets. State supplementation is generally low, but some states are actively working to make the energy safety net more robust. For example, Washington launched the State Home Energy Assistance Program using $35 million through Climate Commitment Act funding. By increasing the income limit, the program expanded eligibility to more than 1.2 million people, compared to 500,000 who would’ve been eligible under federal LIHEAP criteria alone. Another example is New York’s Energy Affordability Program, which supplements LIHEAP with additional bill discounts.

Second, state leadership can encourage respective public utility commissions to enhance rate designs that protect low- and moderate-income rate payers. This includes enacting or improving lifeline tariffs, percent of income payment plans, separate tariffs for low-income rate-payers and other energy affordability schemes. Third, state agencies related to housing, health and special populations can strengthen cross-program linkages to make it easier for households to access complementary social assistance programs. This would require harmonizing beneficiary databases and coordinating constituent engagement efforts to increase enrollment.

City-level initiatives

Cities can update their building codes and local laws to require landlords to invest in energy efficiency retrofits and provide adequate heating and cooling during periods of extreme weather. For instance, New York City’s Local Law 97 mandates that all large buildings, including affordable housing buildings, reduce their emissions by implementing prescriptive energy conservation measures. Another bill under discussion in the New York City council would require landlords to equip rental units with cooling devices. Though affordability challenges might limit use, such provisions can reduce energy burdens and protect the health of tenants, especially the elderly and medically vulnerable.

Finally, cities can also bring affordable and clean energy online faster by deploying distributed energy resources such as community solar and virtual power plants that get around long permitting delays, which plague grid-scale energy projects. These investments translate into direct savings via bill credits, while also ensuring that local residents benefit from clean energy infrastructure.

Utility strategies

Utilities can expand their customer engagement programs to proactively enroll and sustain eligible households in energy assistance programs. For example, Xcel Energy operates a fleet of RED trucks in Colorado that drive into communities and help customers access various assistance services. Further, utilities can track and prevent utility disconnections for customers with documented health risks, including homes with elderly members and those dependent on medical devices. Some utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power have eliminated utility disconnections for all customers during extreme weather events.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VLTk4srYzE6sAT7-qK4zn6JP0nHNvUSXwaBiB94tEqI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMjc3M19PcFZhczFyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-28 19:07:15.468322

With Electricity Bills Rising in June, NJ and PA Elected Officials, Consumer and Clean Energy Advocates Convene Outside Electric Grid Operator PJM Headquarters

Demand That PJM Act to Hold Down Electricity Costs and

Improve Energy Reliability by Clearing Long Backlog of Power Projects Awaiting Approval

NORISSTOWN, PA: With families and small businesses across the region about to be hit with increases in electric bills of as much as $30 more per month starting in June, consumer and clean energy advocates from Pennsylvania and New Jersey braved the rain and chill to gather outside the headquarters of electric grid manager PJM Interconnection to urge PJM leadership to do more to protect family budgets and bring more clean, affordable energy to the electric grid as quickly as possible.

PJM, headquartered outside Philadelphia, is the company that manages the regional electric grid for 65 million people across all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia.

June’s electric bill increases are expected to be only the beginning if PJM does not reform its practices to keep up with rising demand for electricity from large data centers coming online in the coming years. Speakers urged lawmakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and other PJM states to continue to put pressure on PJM to reform its decision-making and practices, including clearing the nearly 3,000 backlogged energy projects, most of them renewable energy projects, that are waiting for approval to connect to the electrical grid.

“Let’s be clear, our region’s upcoming electricity rate hikes are not due to MAGA’s manufactured ‘clean energy mandate’ - there is no such thing. These rate hikes are because of the greed of PJM Interconnection and some of its corporate members, and their failure to connect cheaper, cleaner energy that would provide much needed relief to ratepayers. Clean energy is cheaper, period. If PJM connected more clean energy to our grid and reform its process, the average New Jersey home would save $400 annually,”said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, Director of the NJ Sierra Club.

“PJM is relying on outdated, inefficient, expensive, and dirty energy sources to inflate prices and gouge customers to maximize profit,” continued Ramos-Busot. “Today, we are here outside of their headquarters calling on PJM to institute massive queue reform to move clean projects forward, not hand out fast passes to the fossil fuel industry that skyrocket prices for ratepayers.”

""We have an urgent responsibility to greatly increase the renewable energy sources in our grid, both to care for creation and to care for each other,” said Rev. Nathaniel Mahlberg of the United Church of Christ in Valley Forge and POWER Interfaith. “PJM has the power and the means to do so, but its skewed priorities are doing harm to ratepayers and the environment.""

“PJM’s dysfunction means low-income folks pay more for dirty energy,” added Patrick Houston, Campaign Manager, HERE 4 Climate Justice. “That’s not fair. But it is avoidable. PJM needs to get serious about approving clean energy projects that create jobs and cut pollution. Until then, PJMs delay on renewables—and their default to fossil gas—may force more low-income folks in Philly, and beyond, to have to choose between keeping the lights on or the fridge full.”

Renewable energy like solar and wind is now cheaper than other energy sources. Combined with energy storage, it can deliver power more reliably than ever. But currently, less than 5% of the PJM region’s electricity is powered by cheaper, home-grown renewable energy sources.

Advocates were joined by PA State Representative Chris Rabb (D-Phila.), who has introduced legislation (HB 782) to end secret voting on regional energy policies by members of PJM by requiring electric utilities to disclose their recorded votes and explain how their vote was in the public interest. “Decisions by PJM and its members directly impact people’s electricity bill and our commonwealth’s transition to affordable clean energy,” said Rabb. “Allowing these secret votes with no accountability is akin to the fox guarding the hen house. The people have a right to know about the decisions that are being made behind closed doors – especially as those decisions impact our policies and people’s paychecks.”

Speakers highlighted steps by PA Governor Josh Shapiro, NJ Governor Phil Murphy, and some other elected officials in the PJM region who similarly are pressuring PJM to institute reforms to protect consumers, hold down electricity costs, and strengthen grid reliability. They urged more elected leaders across PJM states to join those efforts to prevent future price hikes down the road while ensuring a reliable, sustainable electric grid.

(Reuters) -Cenovus Energy said on Wednesday it was scaling back non-essential workers at its Foster Creek facility in response to wildfires in northern Alberta.

Wildfires in the Canadian province of Alberta have prompted a temporary shutdown of some oil and gas production and forced residents of at least one small town to evacuate.

Cenovus' Foster Creek operation is among a number of oil sands facilities operated by companies with assets in the Bonnyville-Cold Lake region.

That region was affected on Wednesday by several wildfires spanning 2,900 hectares (11.2 square miles) near Chipewyan Lake, a small community in the northern part of the province approximately 130 km (81 miles) west of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray.

Cenovus added that it was closely monitoring the evolving wildfire situation in the region and the staffing measure was a precaution.

Alberta government officials said on Wednesday afternoon there was no threat at this time to the community of Chipewyan Lake, but residents have been placed on a one-hour evacuation notice as winds could shift.

Another blaze, nearly 1,600 hectares in size, is burning out of control about 7 km north of Swan Hills in the province's northern region.

The approximately 1,200 residents of the town of Swan Hills were ordered to evacuate on Monday evening. One oil-and-gas producer in that area, Aspenleaf Energy, said on Monday it had temporarily halted operations as a precaution and shut in approximately 4,000 barrels-of-oil equivalent per day of production.

The Canadian province of Manitoba declared a separate state of emergency Wednesday afternoon due to multiple wildfires threatening many communities and infrastructure. Evacuations and alerts were in effect for multiple communities in northern and eastern parts of that province as of Wednesday.

Company will invest $31.5 million and create 90 new jobs in Greater Peoria region

WASHINGTON, DC- Governor JB Pritzker, Damera Corporation and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) announced the company will open its first U.S. assembly plant in the Greater Peoria region. Damera Corporation (Damera Bus USA LLC in the U.S.) plans to make a capital investment of more than $31.5 million over four years with support from a Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) agreement, which will enable the company to expand into Illinois and create 90 new full-time jobs. The announcement was made with Governor Pritzker and Damera leadership in Washington DC as part of a larger business development trip.

“Over the past six years, Illinois has pushed to solidify our status as a hub of the EV future – and put our shoulder to the wheel to get that vision off the ground and on the road,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “With this investment of more than $31.5 million–supported by state incentives–Damera will expand into our state and create 90 new full-time jobs. Through our competitive incentive programs, workforce development, and other business attraction efforts, the state is bringing in companies like Damera that not only create jobs and opportunity for our people, but commit themselves to our communities.”

“Today marks a milestone for Peoria and Illinois,” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “Investments like this from the Damera Corporation are a testament to the kind of economy we are building here in Illinois; one that provides opportunity to all corners of our state and builds towards a sustainable future.”

Damera Corporation, a Canadian transit solutions provider, is the exclusive North American distributor of the Karsan eJEST, a zero-emission minibus (ZEB) with a capacity of 19 passengers and a range of 130 miles. Damera Bus USA LLC has leased a facility in the greater Peoria region to sell and service the eJEST and to establish their first U.S. electric transit bus assembly plant to deploy additional models. The facility will include assembly lines, testing zones, quality control, storage, and administrative offices as well as specialized areas for battery assembly, charging infrastructure, and sustainability initiatives.

With top infrastructure, a growing EV ecosystem, access to global supply chains and an abundant, qualified workforce, Illinois continues to grow and attract companies in the clean energy space. In recent years, Illinois has topped key economic development rankings, including Site Selection Magazine, which has ranked Illinois second in the U.S. for corporate expansions and relocations for three years running, and CNBC’s Top States for Business where Illinois ranks in the top ten for infrastructure, education, access to capital, cost of living, and tech and innovation.

“As we continue to expand Damera Bus USA LLC’s presence in the United States, our commitment to fostering long-term growth and job creation in the Peoria area remains unwavering. This investment not only strengthens the local economy but also creates hundreds of new opportunities for the community. We are proud to contribute to a vibrant workforce and are deeply committed to supporting the economic prosperity of the region,” said Roger D’Hollander, Chief Operating Officer of Damera. “This investment aligns directly with the BAA waiver application we have put forward that will facilitate our expansion in the US and help reinforce our long-term vision for the future. We would also like to thank Congressman LaHood and his office for their support of this effort and for playing a crucial role in ensuring its success. We are excited about the positive impact this partnership will have on the local economy, the creation of sustainable jobs, and the continued growth of Peoria County and the state of Illinois.”

The company met Team Illinois at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in 2024, which is an annual event that offers state and local economic development teams the opportunity to network directly with international companies considering expanding or relocating to the U.S.

“Illinois continues to attract global leaders in clean energy and advanced manufacturing thanks to our skilled workforce, strong infrastructure, and bold vision for a sustainable future,” said DCEO Director Kristin Richards. “Damera’s decision to establish their first U.S. assembly plant in Peoria is a testament our strategic investments through REV Illinois, and it marks another step toward cultivating a greener economy for all Illinoisans.”

“Damera's decision to be in Illinois for its first U.S. assembly base is a reflection of our state's strong electric vehicle sector. Intersect exists to ensure companies like Damera can find a home in our welcoming state,” said Intersect Illinois President and CEO Christy George. “Illinois is committed to remaining a leader in clean energy, so we welcome the role international innovators like Damera play in providing sustainable solutions and expanding economic opportunities for Illinoisians.”

“The Damera team have been great partners in this process from the very beginning,"" said Chris Setti, CEO of the Greater Peoria Region Economic Development Corporation. ""We are happy that they chose the Greater Peoria region to be their first location in our country, and we look forward to helping them grow in the community and be another successful business calling the Greater Peoria region home.""

Governor Pritzker has committed to a state goal of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Damera Corporation’s decision to expand into Illinois builds upon the numerous clean energy companies that have recently chosen to establish or expand their business in the state including Rivian, Avina Clean Hydrogen, and Wieland North America.

Guided by Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, the REV Illinois program supports a targeted industry for the state - clean energy production and manufacturing - which continues to grow with assistance from Illinois' leadership and their support of innovative technologies that reduce costs and emissions.

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-28 19:48:38+00:00,themoneytrail.substack.com,Can the Economy Survive the GOP Assault on Clean Energy? - Money Trail,Rocky Kistner,,,,,https://themoneytrail.substack.com/p/can-the-economy-survive-the-gop-assault,"last week voicing concerns about gutting clean energy tax credits, which many experts say is the key to competing in the growing international clean energy jobs market.
Last month, E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders, documented a major increase in clean energy plant closings since the Trump administration took office with draconian plans to restrict clean energy projects.
“The situation is that the clean energy business now has the clarity of a snowstorm in midnight,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe told Money Trail.
To be eligible for tax credits, clean energy programs would have to break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and deliver energy to the grid by the end of 2028.
If you follow the money in the clean energy business you will follow it to another country.","Conservative firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene is not one to promote clean energy in Congress, but when Qcells set up a solar manufacturing plant in her rural Georgia district in 2019, she became a fan. “I think they’re fantastic,” she told Politico’s E&E News when the plant announced expansion plans in her district town of Dalton two years ago. “I support all kinds of energy.”

South Korean-owned Qcells is not a household name in the United States, but it is a force in the burgeoning international solar market. Its Dalton facility is now the largest solar plant in the Western Hemisphere after the company invested $2 billion in it and another Georgia plant, which together support 3,800 jobs.

But with the Trump administration now in office, times have changed. The U.S. clean energy boom and the jobs it has created are suddenly threatened.

You would think that Rep. Greene would fight to keep the Qcells plant open when the House passed its massive $3.8-trillion domestic policy bill last week, which would not only cut Medicaid and food stamps, but also eliminate many of the Biden administration’s clean energy funding and tax credits.

You would be wrong.

Deficit-busting tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy are apparently more important than protecting manufacturing jobs in her district. “I just want to pass the big beautiful bill, Trump’s [executive orders], and DOGE rescission cuts and win, win, win!!” she posted on X just before the House narrowly approved its tax and spending bill by one vote.

An Uncertain Future

It’s unclear how much the House bill will impact the clean energy sector, but virtually everyone agrees it won’t be good. First, the Senate needs to weigh in and pass a bill of its own, and there are early indications Senate Republicans will not support axing job-producing clean energy programs in their home states. A group of them sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) last week voicing concerns about gutting clean energy tax credits, which many experts say is the key to competing in the growing international clean energy jobs market.

“We caution against the full-sale repeal of current credits,” the senators wrote, “which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

But energy experts say the damage is already done, and they fear more disruptions are on the horizon. Last month, E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders, documented a major increase in clean energy plant closings since the Trump administration took office with draconian plans to restrict clean energy projects. The ensuing chaos resulted in the cancellation of $8 billion in investments and 16 major clean energy projects across the country.

E2 attributes most of the investment cutbacks to the dramatic rise in business uncertainty injected into international markets after the Trump administration’s record increase in tariffs, which seem to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. This uncertainty makes it nearly impossible for companies to plan for the future.

“The situation is that the clean energy business now has the clarity of a snowstorm in midnight,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe told Money Trail. “Europe is doubling down on clean energy while we’re pulling back…. Instead, we’re cleaning up oil spills.”

What is even more distressing for clean energy advocates is the growing rate of wind and solar project cancellations. In February and March of this year, 13 projects and more than $5 billion in investments were cancelled or downsized, E2 reported, including a cancellation of a $200-million Bosch hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina and $2.6-billion Freyr Battery plant in Georgia.

Adding to the debacle, the massive House tax and spending bill will add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit and eviscerate the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), clean energy advocates say, eliminating tax credits for renewable projects but maintaining them for nuclear plants. To be eligible for tax credits, clean energy programs would have to break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and deliver energy to the grid by the end of 2028. In addition, federal tax credits for popular consumer clean energy technologies, including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles would be terminated by the end of this year.

Losing Jobs and Money

According to the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, repealing the IRA would:

· Increase cumulative household energy costs by $32 billion over the next decade.

· Cost nearly 790,000 jobs in 2030 and more than 700,000 jobs in 2035.

· Decrease gross domestic product by more than $160 billion in 2030 and nearly $190 billion in 2035.

· Increase climate pollution more than 530 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035, the equivalent of adding 116 million cars to the road.

A handful of states would be hit especially hard by a combination of high energy costs and job losses. “Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Georgia stand out as the biggest losers from IRA repeal,” Energy Innovation says, “due to their poor combination of lost jobs and increased household energy costs.”

E2 Executive Director Keefe said one of the most frustrating aspects of the Republican attack on the U.S. clean energy industry is that much of the technology was invented here in the United States.

“American science created the photovoltaic and lithium ion battery, but we’re not investing in it,” Keefe told Money Trail. “Instead, we’re cutting Department of Energy research to the bone and ostracizing scientists…. If you follow the money in the clean energy business you will follow it to another country. Business investment will go elsewhere, not to places like Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky.”

Despite this dire situation, Keefe said he’s still upbeat about the future of his business. There’s still plenty of demand, he said, as the price of wind and solar energy continues to fall.

“The clean energy industry still has momentum,” he said. “No doubt we’ve hit a serious speed bump. But in two to four years, we’ll get back on track.”

Climate scientists and business leaders say the clean energy industry needs more support and investment—not less—if the United States is going to compete in the international marketplace. There is no other path forward to prosper in a sustainable world.

American Clean Power Association (ACP) chief executive officer Jason Grumet points out that the budget plan is at odds with President Trump’s goal of American energy dominance.
“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” Grumet cautioned.
Terminating Section 6418 transferability would have an immediate effect on the tax credit marketplace by putting a tight window on buying these tax credits, Ryan’s Boccaccio noted.
“The House bill contains several complex and potentially unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions on Sections 45Y and 48E, which could be applied at the ownership and component level,” Boccaccio confirmed.","“To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years,” Sir Winston Churchill once quipped. “To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.”

So it was, and so it remains.

In 2022, following decades of a plodding, two-steps forward, three steps back dance on renewable energy progress in the United States, there was a watershed moment for believers in a net-zero future and America as something more than the place that puts the ‘Made in China’ sticker on: the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). President Joe Biden’s landmark infrastructure legislation was a much-needed shot in the arm, one that pumped hundreds of billions of dollars through long-limp veins of domestic manufacturing, spawned new industries, and was on pace to spare Americans from breathing in billions of tons of greenhouse gases. The IRA’s carrots-over-sticks approach to encouraging clean energy production, its long runways for incentives, and the ability to transfer and sell credits gave developers and financial institutions the peace of mind necessary to put together mega pacts that enabled infrastructure development at a New Deal-esque pace.

In light of a self-declared “energy emergency” amidst staggering load growth spurred by an invisible AI arms race, an honest observer might expect the IRA to be added to, much less set out to sea and shot with a flaming arrow. Lots of Republicans even signed their names to sternly worded letters warning the Ways and Means Committee that they’d better not mess with the benefits flowing into their districts since the IRA’s perks disproportionately benefit Republican communities, after all.

And yet.

Last week, the U.S. House voted 215-214 to pass a sweeping budget reconciliation bill, deemed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), that torches the IRA, neutering its tax incentives, undermining its goals, and all but guaranteeing dirtier air, fewer American jobs, and higher electricity bills nationwide.

Its fate now rests in the hands of the Senate. While some are optimistic that the bill won’t reach President Donald Trump’s desk in its current form (and Democrats may have a way to sabotage the debate over it entirely), the IRA and what it enabled – the chariot, the dress, the glass slippers – appear as close to midnight as ever. The OBBBA kills existing federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits by year-end, accelerates the phase-outs of tech-neutral investment tax credits under Section 48E and the commercial production tax credit under Section 45Y, and eliminates credit transferability entirely, among myriad other shocks to what seemed to be functioning systems.

What took decades of work to put together risks being thrown asunder in mere months, and nobody in the energy industry (outside of the oil and gas lobby) seems particularly pleased about that.

Fewer Jobs, Higher Electricity Bills

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates that the Ways and Means Committee’s recent proposal to slash federal renewable energy tax credits would put 331 U.S. factory openings, 330,000 jobs, and more than 145,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) at risk. The solar advocacy group launched a new site tracking the damage the House budget bill could cause, warning that “America’s Solar Industry is UNDER THREAT.”

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” alerted Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation. If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China, and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

SEIA’s analysis shows $285 billion in local investments could be erased if the OBBBA becomes law and indicates consumer electricity costs will increase by $51 billion nationwide. The bill would also repeal the Section 25D residential tax credit, a key driver of energy freedom for middle-class families. Repealing it leaves households with no accessible path to lower their costs with solar, SEIA argues.

American Clean Power Association (ACP) chief executive officer Jason Grumet points out that the budget plan is at odds with President Trump’s goal of American energy dominance.

“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” Grumet cautioned. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption. It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses, and we stand ready to help. As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” Grumet concluded.

ACORE president and CEO Ray Long echoes many of his peers in calling for an ‘all-of-the-above‘ energy approach to navigate load growth and improve reliability, but fears the House reconciliation bill only sets us back.

“As ACORE’s own survey of clean energy investors showed, recklessly disrupting tax incentives will undermine projects that are ready to come online, meet our nation’s growing energy needs, and create jobs,” shared Long. “ACORE is committed to working with Congress and President Trump to make any improvements to this legislation and help them deliver on his promise to slash energy costs for Americans by 50%. It’s time to achieve American energy dominance across all technologies.”

Losing the AI Race, Giving up on Clean Transportation

The House bill threatens U.S. energy development, heavily favoring fossil fuels and thereby driving up not only greenhouse gas emissions but utility bills since solar PV is the cheapest and fastest-to-market generation technology at the moment. The United States needs to add 206.5 GW of new energy capacity by 2030, with solar expected to supply 73% of that capacity, according to SEIA. Without solar and storage, America will have an energy shortage that raises utility bills and slows economic growth. And by stifling energy development, the OBBBA also crimps our ability to compete with China in our ongoing competition to create god in the machine.

“The House passed a bill that threatens U.S. energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China,” ventured Scott Elias, director of policy and market development at CleanCapital. “Put simply, Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments, and stall clean energy deployment, making it harder, not easier, to build new sources of energy generation that America increasingly needs.”

Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, said while he appreciates the endorsement of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit by the House, this retroactive repeal (considering many contracts are in place for products through 2030) of the incentives to purchase American-made solar components undermines existing commercial agreements.

“The result will push developers back to buying overly-subsidized Chinese products evading our trade laws, while raising electricity costs for everyone. If this were to become law, it would be a boon to Chinese manufacturers and a tremendous step backward for American jobs, competitiveness in manufacturing and AI, economic security, and energy security,” Carr ventured.

CALSTART president and CEO John Boesel noted that the legislation is a major setback for America’s clean transportation future and global competitiveness in the EV space. He called the Trump Administration’s policy U-turn an act of “economic self-sabotage.”

“By dismantling key pro-manufacturing tax credits, this bill jeopardizes more than $200 billion in private investments and threatens automotive-related jobs in the United States,” Boesel asserted. “The tax credits have been instrumental in establishing a robust domestic supply chain, fostering innovation, and positioning the United States as a global leader in clean transportation. Repealing these measures not only undermines our economic growth but needlessly cedes ground to international competitors who are rapidly advancing in this space.”

“We urge the Senate to reconsider the investment-crushing, job-killing implications of this bill and to prioritize forward-looking policies that support sustainable transportation, job creation, and American industrial leadership.”

Under the current proposal, all existing federal EV tax credits would be eliminated by year-end, requiring immediate action to comply with the existing credit constraints. Businesses would have to complete all EV deals before Ryan Seacrest reaches “1” in the Times Square New Year’s Eve ball drop, outside of a grandfather clause for binding contracts for commercial vehicles over 14,000 pounds. The specific EV tax code sections on the chopping block are the clean vehicle credit under Section 30D, the previously owned clean vehicle credit under Section 25E, and the credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles under Section 45W. All would expire by Jan. 1, 2026, except for the 45W grandfather clause mentioned, and a one-year extension for EV manufacturers with 200,000 or fewer units sold domestically from 2010 through 2025.

“This means, for example, that a fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks will need to be purchased by year-end but that a custom 10-ton EV snowplow would have needed to be already under binding contract before the bill passes if not placed in service this year,” observed Ian Boccaccio, principal and income tax practice leader at Ryan Tax Firm.

Terminating the Section 30C alternative refueling property credit would curtail the expansion of EV charging station infrastructure. The effect would be especially potent combined with the termination of the federal grant program under the Unleashing American Energy executive order signed in January, Boccaccio warns. Another initiative, the new residential energy-efficient home credits under Section 45L, would be eliminated at the end of the year, too, with no grandfather clause for beginning construction, meaning the lease-up or sale of the residential units must occur this year.

Far-Reaching Implications for Renewable Energy

Heather Cooper, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery, believes the changes made by the House to an already grim-looking budget will be devastating to the renewable energy industry, its employees, and the United States’ investment in energy infrastructure.

“Developers will need to scramble to ‘start construction’ on their pipeline projects within 60 days of enactment, typically by making large procurement orders,” she assessed. “There is going to be tremendous pressure on developers to find suppliers and manufacturers with queue capacity. Once that deadline passes, developers are out of luck and will be ineligible for credits on energy-generating projects.”

“Residential solar projects, in particular, are hard hit by this bill, losing both the credit for individual homeowners and commercial developers who lease projects to homeowners,” Cooper added. “This bill removes any real grace period to give developers time to prepare and adjust to new economic realities and will cause a total cliff in investment in the energy sector.”

Transferability under Section 6418 would be repealed for Sections 45Y/48E projects that begin construction two years after the date of enactment, sometime in mid-2027. Terminating Section 6418 transferability would have an immediate effect on the tax credit marketplace by putting a tight window on buying these tax credits, Ryan’s Boccaccio noted.

According to the OBBBA’s language, the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X would end for all solar and storage components after Dec. 31, 2031. Transferability for the Section 45X credit would be repealed for components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. And perhaps most alarmingly, an eligible component is subject to strict “foreign entity of concern” provisions that drastically limit the use of Chinese equipment and intellectual property.

“The House bill contains several complex and potentially unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions on Sections 45Y and 48E, which could be applied at the ownership and component level,” Boccaccio confirmed. “This means that if you have direct or indirect foreign ownership or even debt to a foreign company, these should all be fully vetted before jumping into a major green energy project. FEOC restrictions would have an immediate impact and could stop investment from foreign entities such as Canada and Mexico.”

If the FEOC components aren’t altered by the Senate, something as simple as using a Chinese screw could now literally screw a project out of capitalizing on tax credits.

What Happens Next?

Despite what may read like a 2,100-word epitaph above, some energy industry analysts remain optimistic. This is the 55th repeal attempt of the Biden administration’s landmark tax-and-climate measure, Boccaccio pointed out. Over the previous attempts, 29 made it to the floor of the House, and the other 25 died in committee. The 29 votes that made it to the floor each failed by at least an eight-vote margin.

“We were kind of prepared to see potentially a full repeal of the IRA come out of the House Ways and Means Committee,” confessed Bryen Alperin, managing director at investment firm Foss & Co, which helps businesses utilize the tax credits enabled by the IRA.

“When you look back in history at the first tax cut and Jobs Act, a lot of times what comes out of the House is a little more aggressive, and the Senate has a softer approach. We land somewhere in the middle,” Alperin surmised. “So we might see that play out here.”

Considering that roughly 72% of all job creation and 86% of all private investment in green energy projects encouraged by the IRA have come in Republican districts, there is still hope that a fair number of Senators won’t let the budget language pass as-is. Hope can be a sufficient breakfast, but it’s always a bad supper.

“It’s now up to the Senate to fix this big, ugly mess of a bill,” recommended Bob Keefe, executive director of the national nonpartisan business group E2. “With more than 400 major clean energy projects and our energy future hanging in the balance, we hope they’ll put their constituents ahead of politics and make America great through action, not words.”

“It’s not too late for Congress to get this right,” chimed SEIA’s Hopper. “The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the U.S. Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-28-2025-11_31_27-AM.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:13:12.974572

If Republicans lose a few senators and aren't in a position to move the bill past a deadlock via a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance, President Trump could get very angry. But given that the legislation contains an all-important extension of the 2017 tax cuts, let's assume that GOP senators who fear the wrath of Don will fall into line.

That would mean it's game over what has been a burgeoning U.S.-based electric battery industry. InsideEVs' Tim Levin reviews the situation, duly noting that the bill also takes the axe to EV incentives. The loss of the longstanding $7,500 federal tax credit is likely to damage already slowing EV sales in the U.S., but what's more alarming is the degree to which the legislation could kill investment in domestic battery manufacturing.

Levin cites a recent report from Princeton's REPEAT project that summarizes in admirable detail the current and future landscape of EV and battery production in the States. It's extremely wonky, but worth a closer look if you care about this stuff. The researches highlight a critical linkage between EV incentives and increasing battery manufacturing capacity. Remember that not so long ago, the Biden administration was aggressively supporting an advanced, domestic battery supply chain.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reorganized previous EV incentives to favor vehicles made in America. Batteries were also supposed to be largely sourced here. The goal was to stand up an American battery industry that could challenge China's dominance, maintain national security, and generate potentially thousands of jobs.

Of course, building a bunch of new battery factories is pointless if you don't have enough electric cars to put them in. REPEAT maintains that if the expected battery manufacturing capacity of 400 GWh per year arrives in 2025, the country would be producing far more battery cells than needed by an EV business dealing with ebbing demand and withdrawn incentives.

How much excess capacity are we talking about? REPEAT says 29-72%. Let's get real: an industry that isn't using a third of its capacity is going to be an industry in big trouble. But an industry that has almost three quarters of its capacity sitting idle? That's not an industry. One would need Soviet levels of aimless production to keep it going.

It's not unreasonable to ask if all those big, beautiful battery factories were going to be a good thing. Clearly, the EV market in the U.S. isn't growing at quite the pace many analysts expected. Meanwhile, EV sales have been booming in China, justifying the country's foresighted investment in battery manufacturing.

I would also point out that what's driving the Big, Beautiful Bill politically is perpetuating tax cuts – and finding spending reductions to pay for them. Unbuilt battery factories, future employment, and the fate of EVs in America aren't exactly top of mind for a GOP that needs to juke the economy before it dips into a recession. Ironically, however, the battery factory boom was poised to lift fortunes in Republican-controlled states.

The support of GE Vernova Foundation, coupled with braided funding from the Healey-Driscoll Administration’s Workforce Skills Cabinet, will equip schools with state-of-the-art equipment and innovative curriculum tailored to green technology. It is the hope of Commonwealth Corporation Foundation that public-private partnerships like this one will catalyze further investments, thereby enhancing the capabilities of Massachusetts' vocational education system to lead in clean energy training.

“Commonwealth Corporation Foundation is engaging stakeholders to complement strategies that will help build a strong workforce in Massachusetts,” said Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones, Chair of the Workforce Skills Cabinet, and member of the Commonwealth Corporation Foundation Board. “By partnering with the Workforce Skills Cabinet, we look forward to leveraging this new investment to strengthen the skills of our future talent and develop even more talent through the Career Technical Initiative to support clean energy workforce demands in Massachusetts.”

“Massachusetts is leading the way in preparing our students and adult learners for high-growth industries and the jobs of tomorrow,” said Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler. “By expanding access to high-quality career technical education, we’re giving students the tools they need to succeed while helping the Commonwealth meet its climate and workforce goals.""

“The Commonwealth cannot meet its ambitious Clean Energy transition goals alone - it will take an all-hands-on deck approach,” said Commonwealth Corporation Foundation Executive Director Alanna Mallon. “This public private partnership exemplifies how we can synergize private investments like that from GE Vernova Foundation with state funding to ensure we can fill the present, and future, clean energy workforce gaps we need to be successful.”

“Progress is powered by people, and the GE Vernova Foundation is committed to supporting the energy leaders of tomorrow with critical skills training and professional development today,” said Kristin Carvell, President of the GE Vernova Foundation and Chief Communications Officer, GE Vernova. “As we work to tackle the toughest challenges in communities across Massachusetts and the world with relentless optimism, we are excited to continue our efforts to close the trade skills gap and empower the next generation.”

San Juan, P.R. - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is announcing $9.7 million in grant funding that states, Tribes, and territories will use to monitor water quality at coastal and Great Lakes beaches and to notify the public if elevated levels of illness-causing bacteria make swimming unsafe. Puerto Rico is eligible to receive $321,000 and the U.S. Virgin Islands is eligible to receive $126,000. EPA anticipates that it will award grants after all legal and administrative requirements are satisfied.

“Beaches are the crown jewel of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and this funding will help them ensure that the beaches are open for business and that beachgoers can swim and splash without fear of getting sick,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “These grants will help Puerto Rico and the USVI test and monitor to ensure that the public has the information it needs to enjoy a safe time on the beach.”

This funding is authorized by the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act and it advances the goals of cooperative federalism and ensuring that every American has access to clean and safe water. Each of these goals supports EPA’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative.

Learn more about the BEACH Act grants.

Before heading to the shore, check the relevant state, Tribal or territorial beach program website for closing or advisory information.

Background

To be eligible for BEACH Act grants, states, Tribes, and territories must have coastal or Great Lakes recreational waters adjacent to beaches or similar points of access used by the public. They must also have a water quality standards program and EPA-approved numeric recreational water quality standards for coastal waters. Additionally, eligible entities must meet 11 performance criteria for implementing monitoring, assessment, and notification components of the beach program. Each grantee receives an amount based on the length of the beach season, the number of miles of shoreline and the populations of coastal counties.

GM is in the middle of changing its manufacturing operations to reduce tariff costs, Barra said.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra acknowledges the company could have been better positioned during its conversations with President Donald Trump in his first term — particularly when it came to the Detroit automaker's North American manufacturing operations.

GM's top executive said on stage at the Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything conference in New York City that she brings lessons learned from past interactions with Trump’s White House to today's tariff-related conversations.

“When we didn’t see eye to eye on some things, I think there’s actually some things where General Motors could have handled some situations better,” Barra said May 28, referring to the company’s past chats with Trump’s administration. “We had to do some restructuring, and we could have executed better, which would have positioned it a lot better.”

During the negotiation of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, the existing trade pact among the North American countries that Trump managed during his first term, conversations between the president and GM occasionally turned ugly. At the time, GM was in the process of shuttering its massive assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which had focused on manufacturing small cars, amid restructuring efforts that involved layoffs of nearly 6,000 salaried workers in North America.

The changes made national headlines and drew negative attention, and tweets from the president.

“But even through that period and then beyond, we’ve always continued to have dialogue, and that’s a kind of a lesson learned. I’ve been very clear that I believe in electric vehicles, I’m very clear about the importance of manufacturing,"" she told Editor in Chief Emma Tucker. “Having the dialogue to make sure they understand our industry — because I think we do have a shared goal of strengthening it — has been beneficial.”

GM making production changes

GM is facing costs up to $5 billion this year from Trump’s tariffs, the company said after its most recent earnings report. Barra applauded the relief stemming from the most recent executive orders signed April 29, which set 25% tariffs on all imported autos, which began in April, and another 25% on all auto parts set to begin by May 3. The change prevented stacking tariffs on top of previously announced duties on steel and aluminum, the costs of which Barra described as “untenable.”

GM has made a variety of production changes at plants in the United States this year, including an $888 investment the company announced late May 27 in its New York propulsion assembly plant to produce the next-generation V-8 engine, the automaker’s largest investment ever in an engine plant. GM said April 23 that it planned to expand transmission production at its Toledo Propulsions Systems plant where it builds transmissions used in the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks.

“We’re trying to make changes to pay less tariffs because we’re strengthening our U.S. manufacturing,” Barra said. “There’s decisions we can make when we look at the entire equation … we have the capacity available in some of the assembly plants and engine plants that we have in this country that we’re going to continue to utilize.”

General Motors did not join automakers that advertised tariff-free pricing deals, and Barra would not commit to post-tariff vehicle price changes, citing the dynamic pricing in the automotive industry even without tariffs that requires flexibility to stay competitive.

“I’ve had the opportunity to talk to the president and his administration on a regular basis, and one of the things that I’m very appreciative is they have taken the time to understand ... the dynamics of our industry,” Barra said. “I can’t speak to all the other industries that are facing tariffs, but I can tell you for decades now, it has not been a level playing field with U.S. automakers globally with either tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers.”

State departments partner to support, lay out a roadmap to train 5,000 new infrastructure workers by 2030 to meet Michigan's critical infrastructure needs

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. – Today, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II announced funding commitments of up to $107 million from the State of Michigan to support infrastructure workforce development initiatives through the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Building Michigan’s Infrastructure Workforce (BMIW) program.

The BMIW program recently released the Michigan Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan – developed by LEO in partnership with their Michigan High-Speed Internet Office (MIHI), the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), Michigan Department for Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), and Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO) – laying out a roadmap to train 5,000 new infrastructure workers by 2030 to meet Michigan's critical infrastructure needs. The funding commitments mark an important first step in realizing the plan's strategies, creating and enhancing job opportunities and training programs and leveraging collaboration between the public and private sectors.

“Across Michigan, workers are rolling up their sleeves to fix our roads and bridges, build clean energy projects, and expand access to affordable, fast internet,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Investing in our workforce is critical, which is why I am excited about our $107 million investment to support the Building Michigan’s Infrastructure Workforce program and build a skilled workforce statewide. Michigan has one of the strongest workforce systems in the nation, and today’s announcement builds on that progress. Let’s keep Standing Tall to help every Michigander get the skills they need for a good-paying job.”

Building on the momentum of the Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan, several state departments have committed funding to support workforce development programs for jobs that will help Michigan fix the roads, expand transit, protect clean water, connect more homes and businesses to high-speed internet and build out clean energy to lower costs for families.

“We’re continuing to invest in Michiganders by amplifying efforts to grow and train a skilled workforce,” said LEO Director Susan Corbin. “These efforts are paying off – Michigan is No. 1 in the nation in credential attainment for adults, No. 3 in the nation for helping adults get employed and top 10 in the nation for Registered Apprenticeships. Infrastructure investments will connect Michigan residents to training opportunities for good-paying jobs and make Michigan more prosperous for all.”

This funding advances the goals of Governor Whitmer’s Executive Directive (ED 2024-1), “Building Up Michigan’s Workforce and Infrastructure.” Programs highlighted in today’s announcement include:

$35.7 million through LEO’s Transmission Siting and Economic Development (TSED) Grant Program to support specialized education and training through electric utility apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs, as well as training for electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure construction and installation.

$11.5 million through EGLE’s Solar for All (SFA) and Training for Residential Energy Contractors (TREC) initiatives to support the deployment of solar to households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state. SFA will invest in the solar workforce and support access to high-quality, high-wage careers in solar, creating opportunities for low-income individuals to enter the clean energy workforce. TREC will fund training for solar installation, energy storage and energy efficiency upgrades – such as electrical panel updates or roof repairs by creating middle-class career pathways for workers from disadvantaged communities.

$60 million through MIHI’s Broadband, Equity and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide funding for non-deployment uses, including broadband infrastructure workforce development, to support the successful deployment of broadband infrastructure.

Michigan Department of Transportation: Committed workforce programming funding—through new and existing sources— supporting economic growth, mobility and safety through a skilled, diverse workforce targeting investment to meet Michigan's transportation infrastructure needs including roads, bridges, aviation and rail sectors. Training programs are supported by $11 million in existing funds.

“MDOT is committed to recruiting and training the workforce that will design and oversee the building of the infrastructure of the future,” said MDOT Director Bradley C. Wieferich. “This collaboration with our partner departments demonstrates our shared commitment to attracting and retaining the best talent.”

These funding commitments represent a shared recognition of the need for a skilled, diverse infrastructure workforce to support Michigan’s expanding infrastructure needs. The investments are formalized through agreements executed among the state partners that establish a collaborative framework that aligns workforce development with program-specific infrastructure needs.

""Michigan's ambitious infrastructure goals, from safeguarding our water to accelerating clean energy, hinge on a skilled and resilient workforce,"" said EGLE Director Phil Roos. ""As we make once-in-a-generation investments and project tens of thousands of new jobs, investing in our infrastructure workforce isn't just an option—it's a necessity for Michigan's future. The Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Program demonstrates our commitment to building that essential workforce and ensuring our communities thrive.""

Michigan is undergoing an unprecedented infrastructure transformation, with more than $16.7 billion in federal funding driving projects in transportation, rail and transit, clean energy, water, broadband and more. This federal funding is estimated to create approximately 11,000 new jobs each year, representing a historic surge in demand for skilled labor. Delivering these projects on time, on budget and safely will require a highly skilled workforce in every region of the state.

""Historic investments in broadband infrastructure and bringing high-speed internet across Michigan are transforming lives — giving people the technology they need to build skills, access healthcare and fully participate in education,” said MIHI Chief Connectivity Officer Eric Frederick. ""To make that vision a reality, we also need a skilled workforce ready to build and maintain the networks that connect us all. Investing in our workforce has a ripple effect – people have good-paying jobs, and employers have the skilled workers they need to thrive in Michigan.""

“We are excited to see the state already dedicating substantial funding to this program, supporting our state’s current and future infrastructure workers,” said Steve Claywell, President of the Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council. “Working with LEO and other state partners allows us to effectively align worker training with Michigan’s infrastructure needs.”

“As our state continues to invest significantly in roads and bridges, the BMIW program plays a critical role in ensuring we build a skilled, diverse workforce ready to deliver on transformative projects,” said Dannis Mitchell, Senior Director of Community Engagement at Barton Malow. “The Michigan Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan, coupled with these strategic investments, strengthens our ability to address workforce pipeline challenges while equipping individuals with the technical training needed to expand and maintain Michigan’s transportation systems.”",https://www.michigan.gov/leo/-/media/Project/Websites/leo/Images/Executive1/LEO_WebIMG/Someone-working-on-their-computer.jpg?rev=4a01d7cb73304829b4bbfbd5b080a586&hash=828DA554C5E1A9686253BB3B6A1EB500,N,,2025-05-28 17:16:29.712219

The bill could give his major policy shifts the full weight of federal law and make it much harder for a future Democrat in the White House to reverse them.

The more than 1,000-page bill includes Mr. Trump’s orders for immigration and the border, the tax code, education, energy, the military, the judiciary, health services and entitlement programs.

These are some of Mr. Trump’s policies that would be cemented into law if Republicans move the bill through Congress as planned in party-line votes.

Mexico City Policy

The bill would codify Mr. Trump’s order reinstating the Mexico City Policy that bans U.S. foreign aid from providing or promoting abortion services. It further requires aid recipients, such as nongovernmental organizations, to attest that they will not use U.S. funds or non-U.S. funds for abortion services.

President Reagan first adopted the policy in 1984. He announced it at the second International Conference on Population in Mexico City.

SEE ALSO: Musk slams Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ as undercutting DOGE, raising national deficit

Since then, the policy has shifted with administrations. Democratic presidents have rescinded it, and Republican presidents have reinstated it. The House Republican bill tries to break this cycle.

Abortion rights advocates, who call the policy the “global gag rule,” say the restrictions on U.S. foreign aid reverse strides in global health, gender equality and human rights, making it harder for disadvantaged women to access health care.

Supporters say the policy has resulted in minimal disruptions to health care in foreign countries because pro-life policies do not negate quality health care.

Golden Dome

The legislation would require the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. In January, Mr. Trump ordered the creation of a system that would put U.S. weapons into space for the first time to protect against missile attacks.

The Golden Dome, based on Israel’s Iron Dome defense system, is a multilayered project to deploy next-generation technologies across land, sea and space, with space-based sensors and interceptors.

The system, first proposed by Reagan but never realized, would destroy missiles before launch or intercept them in flight.

Mr. Trump said building the Golden Dome would take three years and cost $175 billion. The House Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” includes a $25 billion down payment on the project.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the long-term cost of the system’s space-based components would reach $542 billion over 20 years.

Federal workers

The legislation would codify several of Mr. Trump’s orders that tightened the standards for some federal workers to receive full civil service protections.

It includes a new set of performance evaluations for federal workers during the probationary period of their employment, providing more opportunities to fire new employees before they become tenured civil servants.

Rather than making federal workers tenured civil servants by default, Mr. Trump’s Rule XI mandated that agencies affirmatively certify at the end of the probationary or trial period that a worker’s appointment advances the public interest.

The bill also enshrines into law Mr. Trump’s order to root out “deep state” partisanship. It classifies career government employees who work on policy matters as “schedule policy/career” employees who are “held to the highest standards of conduct and performance.”

“If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job,” Mr. Trump said.

Opponents say the order weakens the government’s civil service system, but Mr. Trump and his supporters insist it brings more accountability to a bloated bureaucracy.

Immigration and the border

Several of Mr. Trump’s executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration made their way into the legislation, including spending to complete the border wall and cutting off illegal immigrants from Medicaid and other taxpayer-funded benefits.

The bill would authorize about $175 billion to strengthen border enforcement and implement the president’s immigration agenda.

About $46.5 billion would go toward modernizing and expanding the border barrier system and completing 701 miles of primary wall and 900 miles of river barriers. Also, $2.7 billion would pay for other border security technology, such as sensors, surveillance towers and tunnel detection systems.

Another $4.1 billion would be spent on hiring and training Border Patrol agents, and $2 billion on retention and signing bonuses.

Protecting children

Mr. Trump’s order barring taxpayer dollars from paying for children to undergo transgender treatments would become law under the House-passed bill. The legislation would prohibit Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program or the Affordable Care Act from paying for sex-change procedures for minors.

Critics of Mr. Trump’s order said it denigrates and punishes transgender people. The president’s order, however, described the restrictions as a way to protect children from irreparable harm.

Reinvigorating the coal industry

The bill would codify the order for the interior secretary to make available for lease at least 4 million additional acres of known recoverable coal resources on federal land in Western states and Alaska.

Areas not open to coal-recovery leases would include land within a national monument, national recreation area, national military park, national historical park, national battlefield site, national memorial, unit of the National Fish Hatchery System, unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System and a National Conservation Area.

The elimination of coal has long been a top goal of climate change activists. Mr. Trump argues that forgoing coal puts the U.S. at an energy disadvantage when countries such as China continue to use coal to fuel their economies.

Unleashing American energy

Another provision is Mr. Trump’s order repealing the Biden-era electric vehicle mandate and Green New Deal policies.

The bill also codifies Mr. Trump’s declaration of U.S. policy to promote energy production and exploration on federal lands and waters.

It would require agency heads to review all regulations restricting domestic energy production and use and implement plans to roll back or alter those regulations.

By putting these measures into law, the Republican-controlled Congress would be undermining the climate change movement, which the Democratic Party has championed.

Oil drilling in Alaska

Mr. Trump’s order to fully use Alaska’s ample natural resources is part of the House package. It codifies the Trump administration’s rollback of policies implemented since January 2021 that restrict resource development on federal and state lands in Alaska, including the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Oil and gas drilling in ANWR has been hotly debated for decades. The region could be a massive resource for oil and gas, but environmentalists warn that energy development would threaten diverse wildlife and Indigenous communities.

The bill would also codify Mr. Trump’s order to expedite the permitting, leasing and infrastructure projects critical for developing Alaska’s resources, particularly its liquefied natural gas industry and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Garden of American Heroes

The bill includes Mr. Trump’s order to build a National Garden of American Heroes. This project was ordered in the first Trump administration and is intended to be part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration next year.

President Biden canceled construction of the Garden of American Heroes, which is envisioned as a sculpture garden of 250 life-size statues of people who have contributed to American history.

The legislation would appropriate $40 million to establish and maintain the statuary park. It would authorize spending $150 million on events, celebrations and activities commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/05/27/Trump_83422_c0-205-4912-3070_s1200x700.jpg?95f339deb9ac67256641f176e31c412377e41dcb,N,,2025-05-28 18:14:06.509881

At BMW Group plants, vehicles with electrified drive trains and internal combustion engines are produced alongside one another on the same production line.

The company launched series production of fully electric vehicles with the BMW i3, back in 2013. The electric city car was manufactured for nearly ten years at Plant Leipzig, alongside the BMW Group’s first plug-in hybrid, the BMW i8. At that time, due to its unique vehicle architecture, the BMW i3 was still being built in Leipzig in a dedicated area for electric cars, in parallel with production of vehicles with conventional drive trains.

Since then, the BMW Group has integrated electric cars into production at all its plants worldwide. Many of the plants initially assembled plug-in hybrid models on a single line, mixed in with their diesel and petrol counterparts, on a flexible basis. Electromobility accounts for a steadily growing share of production volumes, surpassing 25% in 2024, with around three-quarters of those vehicles fully electric. A total of 1.5 million BEVs from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands have already been delivered.

With the start of MINI Cooper SE production in Oxford in 2019, the BEV range was extended to the BMW Group’s second brand. The rollout continued from 2020 with the latest generation of e-drives. The BMW iX3 was built in China, while the BMW iX and i4 ramped up in Dingolfing and Munich in 2021. Within a year, all BMW Group plants in Germany had been enabled for production of fully electric vehicles. The company remains committed to integrating electrified vehicles systematically into existing production.

In China, electrification has already been introduced at all plant sites. In the US, Plant Spartanburg is preparing for production of fully electric vehicles from 2026, while Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico will add BEV models for the Neue Klasse to its production portfolio in 2027. Both facilities already produce plug-in hybrid models. The plant in Rosslyn, South Africa, has been manufacturing plug-in hybrids since 2024. The BMW Group’s sites for local production in Brazil, India and Thailand also already build electrified vehicles.

Production of electric powertrain components is expanding beyond Germany. Since the launch of the BMW i3, battery modules, high-voltage batteries and electric motors have been produced in Dingolfing. As part of the electrification of the production network, the Competence Center for E-Drive Production was established at the site. By 2022, it had already reached an annual capacity of over 500,000 e-drives. Other locations gradually ramped up capacity to support the rapid growth in e-mobility. As a result, alongside Dingolfing, fifth-generation high-voltage batteries are now also assembled and installed in vehicles in Regensburg, Leipzig and Spartanburg. The expertise gained since then is now being applied to the sixth generation of e-drives, which will be introduced towards the end of this year with the NEUE KLASSE at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary.",,N,,2025-05-28 18:13:15.800762

The ENERGY STAR program has cumulatively reduced four billion metric tons of harmful emissions and currently supports more than 790,000 American jobs manufacturing and installing ENERGY STAR products.
ENERGY STAR is strongly supported by a wide array of manufacturers, homebuilders, housing organizations, building owners, small businesses, and other organizations.","Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden joined 20 of their Senate colleagues to demand the Trump Administration immediately reverse course on its plan to illegally and unilaterally terminate the ENERGY STAR program. In their letter, the Senators highlight the cost-saving benefits of the program, which is projected to save the average American household $450 on utility bills each year simply by choosing ENERGY STAR certified products.

“For over three decades, the ENERGY STAR program has lowered Americans’ energy bills by informing consumers about energy efficient products. The program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation under authority of Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, most recently receiving $35.7 million in fiscal year 2025 appropriations,” wrote the Senators. “Reporting has indicated, however, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate ENERGY STAR without Congressional approval. Not only is the program protected under federal statute and thus illegal for the Administration to terminate unilaterally, but this decision also lacks basic economic sense. We write to urge you to immediately reverse course.”

Since 1992, ENERGY STAR has reduced energy costs for American families and businesses by $500 billion, including $42 billion worth of savings in 2020 alone. For every federal dollar spent on ENERGY STAR, Americans have enjoyed $350 in savings.

The Senators continued: “ENERGY STAR is the epitome of an effective public-private partnership. As the program’s administrators, EPA and the Department of Energy set qualifying energy efficiency standards for products. EPA also protects the integrity of the ENERGY STAR brand, ensuring it remains well-known, trusted, and indicative of a quality product. Appliance manufacturers then voluntarily display the ENERGY STAR label, notifying consumers that a product will reduce their energy consumption and lower utility bills. The program strengthens consumer choice by sharing critical product information.”

Administered by the EPA and Department of Energy, ENERGY STAR is a voluntary, market-based program that has saved consumers billions of dollars annually. The ENERGY STAR program has cumulatively reduced four billion metric tons of harmful emissions and currently supports more than 790,000 American jobs manufacturing and installing ENERGY STAR products.

“Eliminating the ENERGY STAR program will not only raise energy costs for American families and businesses, but also inflict far-reaching economic harms, threatening industry jobs and the reliability of the grid at a time of growing demand. We again urge you to immediately reconsider eliminating this popular and effective Congressionally authorized program,” the Senators concluded.

ENERGY STAR is strongly supported by a wide array of manufacturers, homebuilders, housing organizations, building owners, small businesses, and other organizations. In April, the U.S. Real Estate Industry sent a letter to the Trump Administration expressing its strong support for the ENERGY STAR program. Additionally, the U.S. Green Buildings Council partnered with the Alliance to Save Energy in leading over 1,000 organizations in urging the Trump Administration to protect the program and maintain full funding and staffing levels.

The letter was led by U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). In addition to Merkley and Wyden, the letter was signed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Angus King (I-Maine), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Clarification regarding the Application of Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification (“Memorandum”).

The Memorandum is transmitted from EPA Office of Water Acting Assistant Administrator Peggy Browne.

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act prohibits federal agencies from issuing permits or licenses that result in exceedance of water quality standards, or other applicable authorities, of the state. This provision of the Clean Water Act requires an applicant for a federal license or permit to provide a certification that any discharges from the facility will comply with applicable Water Quality Standards. If not provided, the federal permit or license may not be granted. Further, the states can impose certain conditions upon federal permits or licenses as a prerequisite to granting the permit or license.

If a state fails or refuses to act on a request for certification in a timely manner, the certification requirements are waived with respect to such federal applications.

Examples of federal licenses and permits that may require Section 401 Water Quality certifications include (but are not limited to):

Clean Water Act Section 404 Dredge and Fill Permits.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hydroelectric Licenses.

Clean Water Act Section 402 Pollutant Discharge Permits.

Natural Gas Pipeline Certificates issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The stated purpose of the May 21st EPA Memorandum is to address questions the federal agency states have been raised in regard to a rule promulgated in September 2023 (during the Biden Administration), addressing Section 401 certifications. It states that stakeholders raised questions about potential applications of the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.

By way of introduction, the Memorandum states in part:

…The purpose of this document is to reiterate the EPA’s longstanding position that states and Tribes must utilize CWA Section 401 only for its statutory purpose – to protect water quality – and not as a weapon to shut down projects for reasons with no basis in the statute or applicable regulations. A certifying authority’s evaluation is limited to considering adverse impacts to water quality, and only such impacts insofar as they prevent compliance with applicable water quality requirements.

This position arguably constitutes a narrowing of the activities that were potentially subject to the 401 certification process under the Biden Administration’s 2023 Rule promulgated by EPA.

The Memorandum also states in part:

…the regulations do not authorize a certification condition based on generalized concerns about water quality untethered to noncompliance with a specific applicable water quality requirement or requirements. It would be inconsistent with CWA Section 401 to deny or condition a certification based on potential impacts not connected to water quality (e.g., based solely on potential impacts to air quality, traffic, noise, project preference, or economic impacts that have no direct connection to water quality). If a certifying authority imposes certification conditions or denies certification for a reason or reasons such as these, then that certification decision would not comply with CWA Section 401 or the EPA’s regulations.

The Memorandum states that EPA will promulgate in the future a Federal Register notice a recommendations docket to identify additional areas of implementation challenges and regulatory uncertainty relate to the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:06.670468

Now the revised legislation advances to the Senate, where it is likely to be amended before both chambers reconcile their differences and finalize the legislation for the President’s approval or veto. Although the legislation is not final and could change before final enactment, its impact on the clean energy provisions enacted as part of the IRA warrants attention from investors, developers, manufacturers, and financiers that rely on these provisions. The legislation imposes a number of significant changes to the IRA, including the elimination of the investment tax credit and production tax credit under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively, for any facilities that are not under construction prior to the date that is 60 days after enactment and a full repeal of the EV credits. Below is a summary of key provisions in the legislation most likely to affect energy and manufacturing transactions.

Phase-Outs and Terminations of Energy and Manufacturing Credits

Under the legislation, several energy-related credits are phased out or terminated. The legislation accelerates the sunset of numerous credits which, under current law, run well into the 2030s or have no fixed end date.

1. Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

The clean electricity production tax credit (the “PTC”) and the clean electricity investment tax credit (“ITC”) are very important components of the IRA. These two tech-neutral credits apply to investments in qualifying clean electricity generation or storage property. The PTC and ITC took effect at the beginning of 2025 and are available to all new zero-emission electricity production facilities. Under current law, the PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032, or when the US power sector reaches 25 percent of 2022 emissions levels, whichever is later.

The legislation significantly accelerates the elimination of these credits. The ITC and PTC are repealed for projects beginning construction more than 60 days after enactment of the legislation. Additionally, in order to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2028. This is a significant departure from prior repeals and sunsets of the credits, in which Congress solely used a “beginning of construction” standard as a transition rule. The two-pronged transition rule under the legislation means that developers will be required to quickly incur 5% of a project’s cost or begin physical work of a significant nature, but doing so will not grandfather the qualification of a project that fails to be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028. Additionally, the legislation specifically eliminates the credit for residential wind and solar leasing arrangements beginning on the day the legislation is enacted.

The effective date of the FEOC restrictions would vary depending on the specific FEOC restriction, as follows: (i) for taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity,” effective immediately for tax years beginning after enactment; (ii) for projects the construction of which includes any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” effective for facilities beginning construction after one year from enactment; and (iii) for taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity,” effective in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

In addition, 100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a “specified taxpayer” makes an “applicable payment” within ten years after the property is placed in service. This is longer than the typical five-year recapture period and does not include a step-down during the recapture period.

2. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit provides a credit for domestic production of key clean energy components like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals. Under the legislation, a phased reduction of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit begins in 2029. Production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify, one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027, and the general phase-out mirrors the 45Y/48E schedule. Under current law, full credit is available through 2029 with a softer ramp-down (75% in 2030, 50 % in 2031, 25% in 2032, and zero thereafter). Similar to 45X, the nuclear production tax credit (45U) ends on December 31, 2031, one year earlier than current law.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers that are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment, taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity” with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning two years after enactment, and eligible components produced in tax years beginning two years after enactment that (i) include any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreement with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

3. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Under current law, the credit is available for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2028. The legislation extends the Clean Fuel Production Credit to make credits available for fuels sold through December 31, 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment and taxpayers who are a “foreign-influenced entity” in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

Foreign Entity of Concern Limitation

The legislation significantly expands the existing concept of a foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) found in other parts of the Code by introducing new criteria and definitions of a “prohibited foreign entity,” a “specified foreign entity,” and a “foreign-influenced entity.” Under the legislation, eligibility for the credits under Sections 45, 45Y, 48, 48E, or 45X (further discussed below) may be denied where a “prohibited foreign entity” is involved in certain aspects of the facility’s development or ownership (typically requiring meaningful connections to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran). The complexity of these rules will require careful planning to ensure compliance and no inadvertent foot fault.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: a broad category established in the legislation encompassing both “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

Specified Foreign Entity: any foreign entity of concern as defined in section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, entities identified as Chinese military companies operating in the United States, entities included on certain federal government lists, certain battery-producing entities, and any foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign Controlled Entity: an entity owned or controlled by the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), citizens or residents of such a nation (excluding US citizens or lawful permanent residents), entities organized under the laws of a covered nation, or entities controlled by any of the foregoing, an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity.

Foreign Influenced Entity: an entity will be classified as a “foreign-influenced entity” if:

During the taxable year, (i) a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; (iii) specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or (iv) one or more specified foreign entities collectively hold at least 25% of the entity’s debt.

In addition, an entity will also be deemed foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly makes, or had reason to know it made, payments of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amounts (each, an “applicable payment”) either: (i) in an amount equal to or exceeding 10% of the total of such payments to any single specified foreign entity, or (ii) in an aggregate amount equal to or exceeding 25% of the total of such payments to multiple specified foreign entities.

While “specified foreign entity” and “foreign controlled entity” are not new concepts (although, as discussed below, the legislation would expand their applicability to more credits), the “foreign influenced entity” is a new category of FEOC. Presumably, these expansions are designed to capture both direct and indirect foreign influence or control, particularly from countries or organizations deemed adversarial or high risk, and serve as the basis for restricting access to certain federal tax benefits.

As discussed in more detail below, under the legislation, a taxpayer classified as a specified foreign entity would be ineligible to claim any credit for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. For taxpayers falling into certain less restrictive categories—such as foreign-influenced entities or those making payments to prohibited foreign entities—the legislation would generally bar eligibility for credits starting two years after the date of enactment.

The legislation applies the constructive ownership rules under Section 318, excluding Section 318(a)(3) related to partnerships, to determine whether an entity qualifies as a “prohibited foreign entity.” This exclusion of partnership attribution rules may prevent the application of Section 318 in the context of partnerships, narrowing the scope of entities deemed prohibited foreign entities through partnership relationships. However, the application of the remaining Section 318 rules could still pose significant challenges when assessing whether a US entity is treated as a prohibited foreign entity under the proposed FEOC restrictions. This raises compliance and structuring concerns, particularly for multinational holding company structures, and may call for a clarification or exception to avoid unintentionally sweeping US companies into the prohibited foreign entity definition solely through constructive ownership.

Material Assistance from an FEOC

A broad restriction applies to any project that receives “material assistance” from an FEOC during construction. This is a new restriction that did not exist under the IRA. A facility is deemed to have received material assistance if:

It includes any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined under Section 45X(c)(6)) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity; or

Its design relies on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or know-how provided by such an entity.

However, the bill carves out a limited exception for assembly parts or “constituent materials” that are not uniquely designed or formulated for use in qualified facilities or eligible components under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X and are not predominantly produced, processed, or extracted by prohibited foreign entities. Although this exception is potentially helpful to the industry, the breadth of this exception may depend, in part, on how broadly “uniquely designed or formulated” is defined in subsequent guidance.

As discussed below, this “material assistance” restriction would generally bar eligibility for credits starting one or two years after the date of enactment, depending on the specific credit.

Transferability of Certain Clean Energy Credits Repealed for Future Years

The IRA permits most clean-energy credits to be sold by taxpayers, which has created a robust secondary market that has allowed sponsors with limited or no tax capacity to efficiently monetize these credits directly to raise capital. The legislation would unwind this regime for some forms of tax credits. The affected credits are those generated under Sections 45Q and Section 48(a)(3)(vii) (i.e., geothermal heat pump systems). The legislation would repeal transferability for projects that “begin construction” two years after the date that the legislation is enacted, which could be as early as July and most likely by August 2025. Accordingly, we expect the familiar “beginning of construction” rules (i.e., 5% safe harbor and physical work test) will apply to grandfather 45Q and geothermal projects that begin construction during the two-year window. Project developers should consider entering into beginning-of-construction arrangements, particularly the 5% safe harbor which is not project specific, to preserve the option of transferability, keeping in mind that a project generally must be placed in service within four years of the date upon which it began construction.

For Sections 45Z and 45X, transferability of credits is terminated after December 31, 2027, for electricity generated or fuels or components made after that date. The legislation does not retroactively disturb transfers executed for 2023-2025 credits, and market participants can still transact in credits generated before the repeal dates.","https://www.mayerbrown.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400,quality=90,format=jpeg/-/media/images/tile-images-for-insights-and-news/tile_bucket-300x400_33.jpg?rev=988f4f8cabc54d06ad33b523a7a3274e",N,,2025-05-28 15:33:11.384323

Sites selected in Iowa are former grocery stores, a YMCA building, a meat packing plant, abandoned businesses and a smelting facility. The EPA Brownfields Program helps a community to assess, clean up and eventually reuse contaminated sites that would otherwise be unusable.

The City of Clinton received a grant for a little over $1 million, which City Administrator Matt Brooke said will be used to remove the pool section of the city’s former YMCA.

The former YMCA building is contaminated with asbestos and lead, which make it unsuitable for redevelopment until it is remediated.

“This grant funding will enable Clinton to continue a crucial environmental cleanup project,” Brooke said in a press release sent by EPA. “Clinton continues to work toward a cleaner and greener community for all people to live, work, and enjoy.”

Iowa Western Community College receives EPA grant for job training

The Iowa grants are part of a nationwide allotment of $267 million in brownfields grants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the program will help to create new opportunities for businesses and housing while strengthening local economies.

“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

The EPA Brownfields Program started in 1995, but saw a significant boost in funding under former President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan.

Another recipient of the recently awarded funding, East Central Intergovernmental Association, has facilitated brownfield clean up projects in eastern Iowa through its participation in the Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund with EPA. The association was awarded $1.5 million to help replenish the fund, which EPA said has been “high performing.” The fund thus far has supported projects like the YMCA remediation in Clinton and a property in Dubuque.

“Many communities are burdened with brownfield sites but lack the resources to address them,” said Dawn Danielson, ECIA’s brownfields coordinator. “The ripple effect of EPA’s investments is transformational, not only for the site itself but also for surrounding properties.”

Danielson said the remediated sites typically become “catalysts for economic development” in the area and breathe “new life” into communities.

Le Mars Mayor Rob Bixenman, similarly said the grant will revitalize “key areas” of the community and help to accelerate the city’s community development plan.

Le Mars was awarded $400,000 to assess and develop clean up plans at a former Walmart, meat packing plant, landscaping company and unused hotel along the city’s business corridor.

The City of Keokuk was also selected to receive just under $2 million to clean up a 16-acre site that formerly smelted and refined zinc and lead. According to EPA, the site is contaminated with coal tar, zinc smelting residuals that are high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH, and heavy metals. The plant opened in 1915 and operated until the 1980s.

The site has received a number of EPA grants as the city works to clean up the site and hopefully attract a redeveloper.

The City of Red Oak was also selected and will receive a $500,000 grant to conduct site assessments and community engagement for unused properties along its Broadway Street.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Keokuk-feature-electrode-paste-9-21-23-e1748455110447.png,N,,2025-05-28 15:34:35.352789

Wind and especially solar already far outpace natural gas for new power generation additions to the nation’s grid, and that trend is expected to continue as signs indicate the demand for renewable energy has nowhere to go but up. Here are three of them.

1. More information about greenhouse gas emissions is available at the click of a button

Federal energy policy aside, many U.S. states continue to pursue vigorous clean power portfolios. Global firms operating in the U.S. also require information about the sources of electricity flowing through the grid in order to fulfill their clean power commitments.

Responding to these demand-side forces, in 2022 the leading U.S. grid operator MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) launched an online greenhouse emissions dashboard, enabling users to track the carbon intensity of the MISO grid across 15 midwestern and southern states. Last year the organization improved its projections to achieve emissions reporting almost in real time.

MISO is one of several regional operators established in the 1990s to support national grid reliability and resilience. Its territory includes Iowa and other states with a considerable stake in wind energy. Part or all of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin also come under the MISO umbrella, along with a small foothold in Texas.

Even after President Trump took office in January, MISO continued to improve its emissions reporting, launching a new ""Consumed"" feature to the dashboard in March that provides a high level of detail on carbon emission at the user end.

“Increasingly stringent regulations, member goals and customer needs are driving requests for MISO to leverage its operational data to provide credible emissions data estimates,” the organization noted in a recent report on its emissions tracking activities. “Drivers for this interest include meeting and reporting emission reduction goals, creating new tariffs to support end use customer demands, increased visibility for operational decisions making, and information to aid investment decisions.""

2. They said it couldn’t be done, but it can

Another indication of the permanency of the U.S. energy transition comes from the green hydrogen industry. Green hydrogen can be produced from water in electrolysis systems that run on renewable electricity, but it is much more expensive than conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas. Globally, the industry has struggled to find buyers. But industry analysts have identified Texas as one market where green hydrogen can compete against natural gas, partly due to co-location opportunities for combining green hydrogen with waste carbon to produce synthetic liquid fuels called e-fuels or electrofuels. The co-location strategy reduces the considerable cost of transporting hydrogen over long distances.

Energy producers are starting to catch up to this analyst consensus. This month, for example, the leading e-fuels producer Infinium started construction on the new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility near Pecos in West Texas. Electricity to run the facility will come from a new 150-megawatt wind farm.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest e-fuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tons per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other e-fuel products,” Infinium wrote in a press announcement. The company has already enlisted buyers in the aviation industry that are motivated to reduce their dependence on conventional jet fuel, including American Airlines and IAG, the parent of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

The co-location strategy is already at work outside of Texas, too. In Iowa, for example, a solar-powered electrolyzer will supply green hydrogen to produce ammonia fertilizer locally, eliminating long-distance transportation costs. Additionally, the New York startup Ecolectro has introduced a containerized, transportable electrolyzer designed for on-site use in multiple hydrogen-dependent industries including fertilizer and steelmaking as well as e-fuels

3. The call is coming from inside the house

For all of President Trump’s enthusiastic embrace of fossil fuels, his “American Energy Dominance” plan includes three major renewable resources — biomass, geothermal and hydropower — under its protective umbrella. All three represent significant opportunities to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil energy.

In the case of biomass, the effect of that policy protection has been almost immediate. While the Trump administration delayed or abandoned other federally supported renewable energy projects, in February the biofuels firm Montana Renewables received approval to draw $782 million from a $1.44 billion loan guarantee issued by the Department of Energy during the Joe Biden administration.

The funds will enable the firm to expand its existing facility in Great Falls, Montana, that uses biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The drawdown was announced by its parent company, Calumet, which said the expanded facility will be one of the biggest in the world with a capacity of 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

The impact of Trump's energy policy on U.S. hydropower activity will take longer to unfold. New hydropower dams are long-term, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. But federal funding for upgrades and energy-efficiency improvements will enable the hydropower industry to maintain its aging facilities and continue its status as a major contributor to the nation’s renewable energy profile. Hydropower accounts for 27 percent of renewable energy generation in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy. Hydropower can also be used for energy storage in systems that pump water into an elevated reservoir at times of excess power and release it into turbines when power demand is high. Such facilities account for the overwhelming majority of renewable energy storage capacity in the U.S. at 96 percent.

An even more significant impact will be felt in the geothermal industry, as new drilling technology expands the range of geothermal power plants into new regions of the U.S. Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal is available at a constant, steady rate on a 24/7 basis, providing gas power plants with a new source of competition.",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/hydropower%20dam%20in%20North%20Carolina%20%E2%80%94%20renewable%20energy%20in%20the%20US.jpeg?h=ea6a6e00,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:34.601200

To do this, Silicon Ranch is partnering with local communities and veterans to build the infrastructure, which is expected to create jobs, national independence, and energy availability.

At a time when clean energy companies face uncertainty from the Trump Administration, with the potential for public-private partnerships like the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to be rolled back, foregrounding the promotion of jobs and community independence is a move that can reposition the administration's stance on sustainability investments.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

""By leaning into a narrative of energy dominance, solar firms are making themselves indispensable to any administration, red or blue,"" Industry Leaders continued. ""That might just be the kind of political insulation they need to weather the coming storms.""

Recent analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shines a light on this critical topic, highlighting the nuances between different reports that offer insight into the country’s net electricity generation.

The EIA provides data from two distinct perspectives: the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor and the Electric Power Monthly/Annual reports. While these reports serve a similar purpose—to reflect electricity generation—small business owners must recognize their differences. Understanding these variations is crucial for making informed decisions about energy use and costs.

One significant insight from EIA’s analysis is that net generation figures from the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor may not align with those published in the Electric Power Monthly or Electric Power Annual reports. This discrepancy arises because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor captures only those generating units managed by a balancing authority. These authorities oversee the balance of electricity supply and demand at a regional or local level, which mainly encompasses larger, visible facilities and excludes many smaller resources, like rooftop solar panels.

EIA’s data indicates that for small business owners considering renewable energy solutions, relying solely on the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can lead to an incomplete understanding of potential energy generation. For instance, while a bustling city might be importing energy from large solar farms, the contributions from many smaller, community-based renewable sources may not be accounted for in the monitor’s figures.

“EIA’s Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more comprehensive view of net generation in the United States because they reflect all generation from grid-connected power plants located in the United States with at least 1 MW of nameplate capacity,” explains Jonathan DeVilbiss from the EIA. For small businesses operating in states with significant solar initiatives, this means they may want to consult the broader Electric Power reports to gain a more complete picture of energy generation—including prospective savings from solar investments.

The recent adjustments to the methodology, including a new survey to better account for generators metered by balancing authorities, can offer practical implications for small businesses. By examining the newly published lists of generators reflected in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, small business owners can identify opportunities for energy savings or local renewable energy partnerships.

However, there are challenges to consider. With different authorities potentially reporting overlapping data—like California’s Independent System Operator, which includes plants in Mexico—small business owners must navigate these complexities. Understanding which reports accurately reflect their local energy landscape will allow them to make better decisions about sourcing energy, thereby influencing their operational costs and sustainability efforts.

Real-world applications stemming from this analysis extend beyond just knowing the data; they involve actionable insights. For example, businesses keen on reducing their carbon footprint may take more calculated steps towards investing in solar energy, informed by both the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor and Electric Power reports. Partnering with local utilities that provide insights into generation data can further enhance their energy strategy.

Additionally, business owners may want to attend local energy forums or workshops to understand the current energy landscape and any available programs. This proactive approach not only helps in identifying potential savings but also positions small businesses to better adapt to future shifts in energy policy and technology.

This kind of engagement is vital, especially as energy costs continue to fluctuate. As energy policymakers refine reporting tools and resources, small businesses stand to benefit from remaining vigilant and informed regarding their energy consumption patterns.

That is true nowhere more than western North Carolina,” he said, pointing to the devastation wrought last fall by Hurricane Helene.","North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Wednesday voiced strong support for retaining and strengthening the state’s electric vehicle industry. Speaking at an Institute for Emerging Issues forum entitled “Future Forward Energy,” at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, Stein said he has communicated with the state’s congressional delegation about the urgency of keeping tax credits designed to support the EV industry.

U.S. House Republicans passed a budget reconciliation bill last week that would eliminate several tax credits for electric vehicles, a move that advocates say will harm North Carolina’s EV industry.

The cuts would undo tax credits leading to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state, according to nonprofit Electrification Coalition.

“Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” Stein told reporters.

He emphasized the importance of drawing businesses to the state to boost its economy and create jobs.

“Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina,” Stein continued. “We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

Addressing the conference, Stein spoke about the Energy Saver North Carolina program that he launched with Secretary of Environmental Quality Reid Wilson.

This initiative offers more than $200 million in rebates for income-eligible households for the installation of energy efficient appliances and other products, like heat pumps and insulation.

Stein said the program is an example of moving forward toward a clean energy economy, strengthening the economy, and putting money back into people’s pockets.

“It is about moving forward. That is true nowhere more than western North Carolina,” he said, pointing to the devastation wrought last fall by Hurricane Helene.

Stein added that his administration has been “laser-focused” on helping western North Carolinians recover since his first day in office.

He also addressed the issue of climate change and its effects on the state.

“As we do the difficult work of seeking the federal and state dollars and putting them to work and communities, we cannot ignore the fact that North Carolina is experiencing more extreme weather with increasing frequency,” he said. “As we rebuild our energy infrastructure out west, we must be mindful of the need to adapt to a change in climate and insure greater resiliency for the future.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0786-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:32:43.767683

Stellantis Taps Insider CEO to Forge a New Path in the US Back to video

Article content

The company that built its brands around American heritage has been falling behind in the US market due to an aging lineup, model delays and pricing blunders. To reverse the slump, the automaker on Wednesday named Antonio Filosa its new chief executive officer — a company veteran picked in part because of his US experience. The 51-year-old Italian lives in Michigan, previously ran the Jeep brand and is seen as a less divisive leader than his predecessor, Carlos Tavares.

But Filosa is stepping into an automotive storm. President Donald Trump’s tariff moves are raising costs and upending global supply chains. In Europe, Chinese manufacturers led by BYD Co. are pushing into a stagnant car market, fanning the flames of competition with their low-cost models. Stellantis’ issues are gravest in the former profit center North America, where its shipments cratered 20% in the first quarter after Tavares hamstrung operations with a series of painful cost cuts.

Filosa now needs to set a clear strategy so the company can move forward, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “Product is key to all of this,” she said. “It’s going to take time to get Stellantis where they envisioned it would be.”

Article content

Despite urgent pressure for change, finding a new CEO took months. Stellantis considered outsiders such as Hyundai CEO José Muñoz and AutoNation boss Mike Manley, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. With key decisions on the company’s future direction stalling, the board led by Chairman John Elkann in recent weeks honed in on Filosa, who beat out another internal candidate, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks were private.

Born in Naples, Italy, Filosa has had a lifelong passion for cars and motorcycles, buying his first Ducati at age 15, and an Alfa Romeo three years later. He joined Fiat in 1999 and later rose through the ranks as a protégé of the late Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne. Living most of his professional life outside Italy, Filosa has held positions in Europe, South America and the US.

As Jeep CEO, he launched the long-delayed battery-powered Wagoneer sport utility vehicle just as EV sales were losing steam in the US. He’s now under pressure to rejig the lineup in the country as local drivers gravitate toward hybrids. Filosa took over as chief operating officer for North America in October as part of a broader shake-up in the waning days of Tavares’ tenure.

Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.
In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities.
Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful.
“Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said.","After days of intense political infighting between ultraconservative and moderate Republicans, the House of Representatives voted along party lines on Thursday morning to approve a sweeping tax bill that seeks to eviscerate the heart of landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats just three years ago.

The 2022 climate law on the chopping block—the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA—was the first legislation in more than a decade to attempt to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and was the centerpiece of former president Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, subsidies, and grants to utility companies, automakers, consumers, and others to become more energy-efficient and switch to sources of carbon-free power.

Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that lawmakers in districts receiving this cash would be disincentivized to undo the legislation supplying it, even under an ultraconservative president like Donald Trump. “Repeal is extremely unlikely,” Neil Chatterjee, a former Republican commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill last August titled “The Solar Investment Tax Credit is safe from repeal even if Republicans win in 2024.” In March, 21 House Republicans signed an open letter calling for any changes to the IRA tax credits to “be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion.”

Yet the House voted 215-214 on Thursday to wind down the IRA’s clean energy tax credits ahead of schedule, including the solar investment tax credit that Chatterjee was sure would be safe. Just two Republicans voted against the bill, one voted present, and two abstained—including only one of the March letter’s signatories.

Originally, the incentives were set to continue through at least 2032. Under the House bill, tax credits for all clean energies except for nuclear, which Republicans tend to view favorably, will apply only to projects that break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and begin sending energy to the grid by the end of 2028, a timeline that could seriously undercut the country’s clean energy industry. Federal tax credits to help consumers adopt clean energy technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles would be phased out by the end of this year.

The House bill needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump to become law, and it is likely to change during negotiations in the upper chamber.

Renewable energy developers warn that the House’s timeline for getting projects in service is prohibitively tight and would effectively make some of the tax credits obsolete. “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement.

The repeals would impact major utility-scale projects that are already underway, such as wind projects, said Katrina McLaughlin, an associate on the World Resources Institute’s U.S. energy team, because it takes a long time to get most renewable projects up and running.

“Placed in service means everything has to go right. We have interconnection queue delays, we have permitting delays, there can be challenges with getting different materials and resources,” McLaughlin said. “So getting in service by 2028 is actually a pretty aggressive timeline.”

In the two years since the IRA was passed, analyses show that federal funding has catalyzed more than $400 billion in investments in manufacturing, electric vehicles, hydrogen power, renewable energy, and other green initiatives and spurred more than 400,000 new jobs. Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.

As House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to unite his party behind Trump’s domestic agenda, two warring factions emerged: a far-right coalition focused on attaining deeper spending cuts by slashing the IRA and Medicare, and a moderate group agitating to retain clean energy funding in their districts and increase the cap on how much state and local tax can be deducted from one’s federal taxes—a change that would benefit high earners in blue states.

Unsurprisingly, the lawmaker leading the fight against the IRA comes from an area that hasn’t received much money from it. Representative Chip Roy, leading the ultraconservative crusade, represents a district in Texas that has a little less than a dollar per person in announced IRA investments. Meanwhile, one of his colleagues on the other side of the fight, moderate Republican Representative Nancy Kiggan, comes from a district in Virginia that is slated to receive $85.50 worth of investments per capita.

Republicans represent 18 of the top 20 congressional districts benefiting the most from clean energy investments since the passage of the IRA, according to the research firm Atlas Public Policy. The top three districts on that list, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, had together received nearly $30 billion from the legislation as of March this year. But in the end, all of the Republican lawmakers representing those 18 districts voted in favor of effectively ending the investments. Democrats, whose caucus has shrunk due to the deaths of three members this year, were united in opposition.

In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities. Moderates in high-tax states like New York were willing to use Biden’s tax credits as a bargaining chip for a higher limit on itemized state and local tax deductions—$40,000, up from the current cap of $10,000—a political win, with benefits that those lawmakers could reap immediately, that allowed them to sidestep having to defend legislation passed by a Democratic administration.

Republicans might also be banking on the fact that many of their constituents don’t know about the IRA. A University of Chicago and Associated Press survey last year found that two years after the IRA passed, most Americans had a supremely flawed understanding of what the legislation is and does, if they knew about it at all. Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful. Nearly 40 percent didn’t know enough to weigh in on the EV tax credits and a shocking 15 percent of those polled thought the policy—which gives consumers up to $7,500 for a new plug-in EV—hurt people like them.

According to Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way, part of the problem is that the IRA’s clean energy incentives—like new union jobs and major infrastructure projects—take years to manifest. “Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said. “It’s having a big impact, don’t get me wrong, but it hasn’t become part of the fabric of communities yet in a way that would freak people out if it disappeared.”

If the Court rules against the NRC’s licensing authority, nuclear facilities would be forced to continue indefinite on-site storage, and existing off-site storage facilities would face uncertain futures.
The Court’s decision will have implications far beyond nuclear waste storage.","In an effort to address this challenge, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently licensed two private CISFs: one in Andrews County, Texas, and another in Lea County, New Mexico. However, both licenses were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held that the NRC lacked statutory authority to license private away-from-reactor storage facilities. State v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 95 F.4th 935 (5th Cir. 2024); Fasken Land & Mins., Ltd. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, No. 23-60377, 2024 WL 3175460 (5th Cir. Mar. 27, 2024).

This legal impasse traces back to two key pieces of legislation: the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982. AEA, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (1954) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2011–2297h-13); NWPA, Pub. L. No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 (1982) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 10101–10270). The AEA established the foundation for civilian nuclear power development in the United States, authorizing private commercial use of nuclear materials and creating a regulatory framework for nuclear power plants.

While the AEA granted the NRC broad authority over nuclear materials, it did not address nuclear waste management or disposal. This regulatory gap became increasingly problematic as commercial nuclear power expanded, leading Congress to enact the NWPA specifically to address the growing challenge of nuclear waste disposal. However, the NWPA created a significant hurdle by explicitly tying the development of nonfederal interim storage facilities to progress on a permanent geological repository. 42 U.S.C. § 10168(d)(1). This linkage, while perhaps well-intentioned, has effectively prevented the establishment of nonfederal CISFs (federal facilities face separate obstacles). In 1987, Congress amended the NWPA to designate Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the sole site for consideration as a permanent repository. Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, § 5011, 101 Stat. 1330-227, 1330-228 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 10172). However, the project faced substantial opposition from local communities and national stakeholders, impeding its progress. In 2009, President Obama eliminated funding for the Yucca Mountain Project in his budget, effectively halting the initiative and further complicating the path forward for both permanent and interim storage solutions. Blue Ribbon Comm’n on Am.’s Nuclear Future, Report to the Secretary of Energy at vi (Jan. 2012).

As noted above, the Fifth Circuit invalidated two NRC-licensed private CISFs—one in Andrews County, Texas (State v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 95 F.4th 935), and another in Lea County, New Mexico (Fasken Land & Mins., 2024 WL 3175460)—ruling that the NRC lacked statutory authority to license private away-from-reactor storage facilities and creating a circuit split on questions of judicial standing and agency authority. On October 4, 2024, the Supreme Court consolidated and granted certiorari in two appeals challenging the license for the Texas facility: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. State of Texas (No. 23-1300) and Interim Storage Partners LLC v. Texas (No. 23-1312) (collectively, NRC v. Texas).

The case before the Supreme Court presents two interrelated issues of administrative law. The first question is whether the NRC’s authority to license private parties to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel away from reactor sites is lawful under the AEA and NWPA. Second is a jurisdictional question under the Hobbs Act—the exclusive statutory basis for courts to review challenges to AEA licenses. While the Hobbs Act limits judicial review to parties “aggrieved” by an agency proceeding, the Court must decide whether entities can challenge an agency’s statutory authority even if they did not participate in the underlying regulatory proceedings.

Both issues reflect significant splits among the federal circuits. Several circuits have rejected challenges from parties who did not participate in agency proceedings, but the Fifth Circuit held that such ultra vires challenges can proceed when parties claim an agency exceeded its statutory authority. This position conflicts with decisions from the D.C., Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. Heflin, supra. Similarly, while the D.C. and Tenth Circuits have upheld the NRC’s authority to license private storage facilities, the Fifth Circuit found no such authority in either the AEA or NWPA. Id. The petitioners contend that Congress implicitly approved this authority by remaining silent when passing the NWPA, as the NRC was already licensing temporary away-from-reactor storage facilities at that time.

The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for March 5, 2025, with a decision expected by summer 2025. This timing is critical for nuclear waste management in the United States. With no permanent repository in development, the nuclear power industry faces growing challenges in managing spent fuel storage. If the Court rules against the NRC’s licensing authority, nuclear facilities would be forced to continue indefinite on-site storage, and existing off-site storage facilities would face uncertain futures. Such a ruling would likely require congressional action to establish a new framework for spent fuel management.

The Court’s decision will have implications far beyond nuclear waste storage. While the ruling on NRC’s authority will determine the viability of CISFs as an interim storage solution, the Court’s interpretation of the Hobbs Act will affect judicial review across multiple regulatory domains. By clarifying when parties can challenge federal agency actions, the decision could impact how the public contests orders from agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Transportation. The Court’s resolution of these issues will thus shape both the future of nuclear waste management and the broader landscape of administrative law in the United States.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/photography/16x9/16x9-windmills-4.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:59.300160

Energy Star helps the real estate industry benchmark its energy use,” the letter said.","That little blue Energy Star logo affixed to energy-efficient home appliances is at risk of being cut by the Environmental Protection Agency, and trade and consumer organizations are pleading with the Trump administration to save it. Their actions are the latest in a slew of letters and pronouncements from professional organizations asking the federal government not to cut programs and tax credits.

The Energy Star program, which was created by the EPA and Department of Energy under President George H.W. Bush, sets energy-efficiency standards for home appliances. In turn, those that meet the standards can advertise with the program’s logo. Earlier this month, CNN reported that the EPA was planning to shut down Energy Star, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has now said that he hopes to privatize the program.

In response to the news that Energy Star might be shuttered, Consumer Reports, a nonprofit product testing organization, urged the EPA to “find a way to preserve” it.

“If this popular program goes away, it would be a big loss for the millions of consumers who’ve come to recognize and trust the label every time they shop for major products and appliances,” Consumer Reports’ associate director for product sustainability, research, and testing Shanika Whitehurst said in a statement. “The loss would hit especially hard at a time when people are dealing with unpredictable energy bills and trying to cut expenses.”

Consumer Reports also cited a March 2025 study it conducted, stating that 87% of the 2,291 people surveyed agreed that “home appliances for sale in the US should be required to meet minimum levels of energy efficiency.” A recent Retail Brew survey similarly found that nearly 85% of readers surveyed don’t want Energy Star shut down.

Other professional organizations are taking different avenues to pressure the federal government to protect Energy Star. Twelve major real estate and building associations, including The Real Estate Roundtable and American Hotel & Lodging Association, wrote a letter to Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressing their support for Energy Star and tied the appliance standards program to the Trump administration’s “all of the above” energy approach.

“Real estate assets rely on the Energy Star buildings program. Energy Star helps the real estate industry benchmark its energy use,” the letter said. “We look forward to working with DOE under your stewardship to achieve the Trump administration’s ‘all of the above’ plan to propel America’s energy dominance, independence, competitiveness, and profitability.”

Additionally, the US Green Building Council is asking its members and the public to contact their congressional representatives and ask them to block the Trump administration’s proposal to end the program—it’s even created a form, phone scripts, and email templates for participants to use.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/f779534ad8305b01a5c377a6211f40ce9090de10-6720x4480.jpg?rect=0,476,6720,3528&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-05-28 15:34:39.312142

The E-Check Ease Act, introduced by state Reps. Bill Roemer (R-Richfield) and Steve Demetriou (R-Bainbridge Township), was incorporated into the state’s biennial transportation budget bill signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine at the end of March.

Under Ohio’s E-Check program, residents in seven counties — Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit — who own cars that are between 4 and 25 years old are required to have their emissions inspected every two years. A passing inspection is required for vehicle registration in those seven counties.

The proposed change would expand the exemption for newer cars from four years old to six years old. Hybrid vehicles that are seven years old or newer would also be exempt.

The bill also allows vehicle owners to forego inspections entirely and obtain an “alternative emissions certificate” from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, attesting that their car meets state emissions laws “to the best of their knowledge.”

That attestation could be rejected if the EPA determines it was falsified or if the driver was cited in the past two years for excessive exhaust or a noisy muffler, or if their vehicle was in a collision in the prior two years which caused “substantial” internal damage. Rejected owners would then have to get the car inspected.

The Ohio EPA is required to submit the new certification process to the U.S. EPA, which must decide whether it complies with the federal Clean Air Act before it can move ahead. If approved, the Ohio EPA would then implement the state-level changes.

The public comment period for the bill opened earlier this month and runs through June 2. Public comments can be emailed to DAPC-Comments@epa.ohio.gov through then. The Ohio EPA is then expected to respond to the public comments and submit the changes to the U.S. EPA.

“For 30 years, Northeast Ohio has been unfairly burdened by E-Check,” Roemer is quoted in a Wednesday news release. “It is far past time to address this problem, and I encourage citizens to reach out to eviscerate this burden.”

State Rep. Sean Brennan (D-Parma) in a Wednesday news release said the E-Check program “may have been well-intentioned” when it was created in 1996, but there’s no evidence it has actually reduced vehicle emissions since then.

He said drivers actually burn about 600,000 gallons of gas per year just to comply with the mandate.

“The $11 million the state spends would be better spent on conservation education and public transit,” he is quoted in the release.",https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/04/echeck.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:11.796562

That was arguably one of the biggest lessons from President Donald Trump’s against-the-odds election to a second term.

From roads, to airports, to mining facilities, to manufacturing plants — we need to start building things in America again. And we need to apply that same pro-development attitude towards the most important, yet too often ignored, infrastructure system in our country: the power grid.

On this question, Nevada is a leader. Today in Lyon County, a major expansion of the Churchill Power Substation is taking place. When complete, the Churchill facility will become one of the largest electrical substations in the world and play a pivotal role in a much larger upgrade of Nevada’s power grid.

From Lyon County, two major power transmission lines are planned — one that heads east for 235 miles to White Pine County and another that heads southeast for 350 miles to Clark County. When connected to the existing One Nevada transmission line in the eastern part of our state, the two new transmission lines will form a triangle between Las Vegas, Reno and Ely.

This $4.2 billion upgrade to the state’s power grid — known as the Greenlink project — will allow for power generation investments in rural Nevada to expand, bringing jobs and tax revenues to parts of the state that badly need both.

At the same time, major population centers like Las Vegas and Reno will gain access to more secure, affordable and reliable sources of electricity to power homes and businesses. In particular, solar power — our state’s most plentiful resource and the cheapest technology for generating electricity today — will play a major role.

In effect, Nevada’s power grid upgrades will allow energy resources that are currently stranded in rural areas to be sold to the cities and suburbs where that energy is in greatest demand. Think of these new transmission lines like highways for electricity to be moved from where it’s produced to where it’s consumed.

Nevada isn’t the only state where this kind of investment is badly needed, of course. Across the country, the power grid is showing its age, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Seventy percent of the transmission lines that make up the grid are more than 25 years old and are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifespan.

“This has major consequences on our communities: power outages, susceptibility to cyber-attacks, or community emergencies caused by faulty grid infrastructure,” the DOE warns.

It’s clear that upgrading the grid, as Nevada is doing, is an example the rest of the country needs to follow for reasons of safety and security. But there are compelling economic reasons, too.

For example: Here in the West, decisions about electrical infrastructure are mostly made at the level of individual states. But if other states coordinated with Nevada, by expanding and upgrading their grids to connect rural communities with an energy surplus to urban centers with an energy deficit, the result would be a more efficient system that saves people money.

According to researchers at the University of California San Diego, Nevada and 10 other Western states could save consumers up to $3.25 billion per year just by working more closely on the planning and construction of transmission lines, power plants and other pieces of major electrical infrastructure.

Importantly, the researchers found that the closer coordination needed to deliver these savings did not require the creation of a single, regional electricity market — a complex political, technical and legal process that would take many years to accomplish.

The end result could be a multi-state power grid, anchored by Nevada’s leadership, providing more reliable electricity at a more affordable cost — and all the while generating more construction projects, jobs, investment and tax revenues to rural communities across the West.

If there was ever a time to make this happen, it’s during President Trump’s second term. Let’s go build the energy future we deserve, for Nevada and the rest of the West.

“We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.” But Grijalva found herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.
Hernandez responded that the difference is that Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working class families.
Foxx said part of that is Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.
“They don’t know how to fight,” Harris said of Democrats.","Key Points:

Multiple democrats debated for a shot to replace late-Rep. Raúl Grijalva

Grijalva daughter would continue her late father’s progressive agenda

All candidates say Democrats need to fight

Daniel Hernandez says the newest member of Congress needs to be someone who pays less attention to environmental concerns and more to the jobs these sometimes-controversial projects create.

But the question remains whether that reflects who Democrats want to be their standard bearer in the special election this summer to replace ardent environmental advocate Raúl Grijalva who they repeatedly elected to the U.S. House.

“When people are struggling to make ends meet, they need someone who will stand up to make sure they have good wages, protections for their families, and make sure that they have a job to be able to go to,” said the former state lawmaker during a debate May 27 hosted by KAET-TV, the Phoenix PBS affiliate. He is one of five Democratic candidates in the July 15 special primary.

Whoever survives will face off on Sept. 23 against the winner of the Republican primary. But the Democratic nominee starts off with a huge advantage of about 176,000 adherents compared with fewer than 93,000 Republicans in the district that stretches from Douglas through Nogales into parts of Pinal and Maricopa counties and west to Yuma.

Hernandez made it clear he supports mining projects like the plan by South32 to extract critical minerals in the Patagonia Mountains, a massive copper mine by Hudbay in the Santa Rita Mountains, and even a proposal to build a new Interstate 11, including a stretch that will run through environmentally sensitive portions of Pima County.

That brought him into sharp contrast with Adelita Grijalva ,who is not only a former Pima County supervisor, but also Raúl’s daughter. And she made it clear she does not see the claimed benefits to Arizona from the projects, saying the profits from digging out the ore are being shipped elsewhere.

“And what’s left in the aftermath is environmental destruction,” she said. Grijalva specifically criticized the plans for a new copper mine at Oak Flat, a project that survived a challenge when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider concerns by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others that the land was necessary for their ceremonies.

And if the message about what voters could expect wasn’t crystal clear, she said she was going to follow in her father’s footsteps.

“I am going to be another Grijalva,” she said. “I don’t think you can be too progressive when you’re on the right side of history.”

Hernandez found himself – and his position on jobs versus the environment – to be in the minority of Democratic contenders. Even Jose Malvido, whose father was a union organizer at Phelps Dodge in Ajo when the miners went on strike in 1983, said much has been lost as environmental concerns were brushed aside in the name of economic development.

“I grew up in a copper mining town where sacred sites were reduced into a giant mine pit,” he said. “It put food on the table, but at what cost?”

Inventor and former business owner Patrick Harris acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs. At the same time, he said, it does destroy the environment.

But for him, the question is a bit different, he said. Where do the profits go?

“Those are short-term jobs,” Harris said.

“That profit is being siphoned out of the district,” he continued. “There are good paying jobs that can be brought into the district.”

And Deja Foxx said that from her perspective – she is 25 – not enough has been done until now to protect the environment that was supposed to be preserved for her generation.

“Every year we see summers get hotter here in Arizona, get longer because of the inaction of older generations,” she said.

“Climate change is not theoretical to my generation,” Foxx continued. “We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.”

But Grijalva found herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.

The contenders were each asked about the wisdom of Republicans in Washington who say that reducing taxes is good for the economy and, more to the point, whether Democrats, who have found themselves losing ground politically, should also consider a reduction.

Hernandez responded that the difference is that Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working class families. Or “most Democrats.”

“The reality is people like Adelita tried to raise taxes just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Tucson,” Hernandez said, referring to a plan on the ballot to increase the sales tax by half a cent. “When we are in the height of inflation and people are hurting, the height of being out of touch was trying to raise people’s taxes.”

It failed by a margin of more than 2-1.

“What we have is a problem where out-of-touch politicians who spent almost two decades in office forget what it’s like to be able to buy groceries at the grocery store, and know what it’s like to have to put something back,” Hernandez said.

Grijalva was unapologetic for backing the proposed levy, saying that not just Tucson but Pima County have had to absorb more costs to provide government services even as the Republican-controlled Legislature was imposing a flat 2.5% income tax. Local governments get a piece of that levy.

“So the needs continue but the revenue decreased,” she said, saying that the cost of these local needs must be shared by federal and state government.

“You’re still trying to raise people’s taxes in the height of inflation,” Hernandez responded.

Foxx took her own shots at Grijalva, describing her own fight years ago with the board of the Tucson Unified School District – the board on which Grijalva served – over its sex education curriculum. Foxx said it had not been updated in decades, was medically inaccurate, and never mentioned things like consent.

Grijalva said afterward that the board already had been looking at making changes when Foxx made her complaints but could not do anything until state law was changed.

If there was a central theme to the debate – aside from the obligatory criticism by each contender of President Trump – it was the question of why Democrats are faring poorly among voters. Foxx said part of that is Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.

“We require activists,” Foxx said.

“They don’t know how to fight,” Harris said of Democrats. “They don’t have a strategy.”

Malvido agreed that Democrats are not fighting back hard enough against President Trump.

“We need to have the courage to really address issues and not worry about the big money people that also fund the Democratic campaigns,” he said.

“A lot of Democrats, career politicians, all they really want to do is get elected,” Malvido said. “So they’re not really going to address the issues and have the courage to fight in the way we need them to fight, especially now.”

Hernandez said the issue for voters goes beyond whether the Democrats are fighting hard enough.

“It’s that we’re not delivering results,” he said.

“You elect people time and time again and yet they come back every two years and they say, ‘We weren’t able to do that because that other person was in charge, but elect us and we’ll do it again next time,’ ” Hernandez said. “People are tired of empty promises.”

One position that did stand out was Harris’ proposal for what he called “capitated capitalism.”

In essence, it would cap individual wealth at $1 billion. And anyone whose assets exceeded that at the end of any year would have to make use of that through things like investing in research.

All that spending, he said, would help stimulate the economy.

“I’m the only one with an economic plan to fund our shared priorities,” Harris said.

As drafted, the Bill includes proposed tax law changes that would have sweeping effects across many of the renewable energy tax credit provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (such proposed changes, the Proposal).1 The Proposal’s most significant proposed changes include:

an extension of time for a taxpayer to be eligible for clean fuel production tax credits (PTCs);

elimination of the clean electricity investment tax credits (ITCs) and PTCs for qualified facilities that (1) do not begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment or (2) are not placed in service by December 31, 2028;

a phased-in elimination of credit transferability under Section 6418, with transferability of carbon capture PTCs being eliminated for projects that begin construction more than two years after the Bill’s enactment and transferability of advanced manufacturing and clean fuels PTCs being eliminated beginning in 2028;

eliminating tax credits after 2025 for commercial and residential electric vehicles (with a phase-down depending on volume of cars sold), residential solar systems for individuals, charging stations, hydrogen, and energy efficient homes; and

imposing certain foreign supply chain and ownership restrictions on taxpayers seeking ITCs and PTCs.

Notably, the Proposal — at least in its current form — does not propose to amend provisions related to PTCs under Section 45 or ITCs under Section 48.

The Bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to revise the Bill, potentially including certain aspects of the Proposal. As a result, the Proposal, including the provisions detailed below, are subject to further revision, and potentially significant changes, as the Bill moves through the legislative process.

If the Proposal is passed in its current form, the following impacts should be considered:

Taxpayers sourcing materials and components from China must analyze their supply chain and non-U.S. ownership structure to evaluate ongoing ITC/PTC eligibility.

Taxpayers utilizing Sections 45Y and 48E must ensure (1) that they begin construction on their qualified facility within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment and (2) that such qualified facility is placed in service prior to January 1, 2029.

Taxpayers utilizing Sections 45Q, 45X and 45Z must consider alternatives to transferability in certain instances, with additional pressure on 45Z due to its general inability to access “direct pay.”

Taxpayers utilizing Section 45Q and seeking to utilize transferability as a source of monetization should begin construction prior to the second anniversary of the Bill’s enactment.

Key Proposals Affecting Renewable Tax Credits

Foreign Entity Of Concern (FEOC) Proposals

Historically, direct or indirect ownership by certain individuals and entities incorporated in, or with a strong nexus to, China, North Korea, Russia or Iran (each, a FEOC or a “covered nation”) jeopardized tax credit availability under the clean vehicle and advanced microchip tax credits. The Proposal would introduce new complicated FEOC restrictions that could limit taxpayers’ access to the (1) clean electricity ITCs and PTCs, (2) carbon capture PTCs, and (3) advance manufacturing and clean fuels PTCs. The earliest of these restrictions would first apply in 2026, with even more onerous FEOC restrictions applying beginning in 2028.2

In general, the proposed FEOC restrictions are in two categories: (1) an ownership- and control-based approach (the Ownership and Control Approach), and (2) a supply chain-based approach (the Supply Chain Approach).

FEOC Ownership and Control Considerations (Applied to Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E)

The Ownership and Control Approach would first apply beginning in 2026. Under the Ownership and Control Approach, any taxpayer that is a “specified foreign entity” would be precluded from claiming ITCs and PTCs.

The Proposal would define a “specified foreign entity” as any (1) covered nation, (2) entity that is 50% or more owned by a covered nation, (3) entity that is organized or has its principal place of business in a covered nation, (4) entity that benefits from Uyghur forced labor in the production of its products or (5) entity that is 50% or more owned by certain battery manufacturers (e.g., CATL, BYD, Envision Energy, Hithium, etc.).

In addition, beginning in 2028, any “foreign influenced entity” would be precluded from claiming ITCs or PTCs. The Proposal would define a “foreign-influenced entity” to include cases where: (1) a specified foreign entity (a) can appoint a covered officer to the taxpayer, (b) holds 10% of the equity (25% if two or more specified entities hold equity), or (c) holds 25% or more of the entity’s debt; or (2) in the prior taxable year, 10% of certain payments, including compensation, were knowingly made by the taxpayer to the specified foreign entity (or 25% of all payments if payments are made to multiple specified foreign entities).3

FEOC Supply Chain Considerations (Applied to Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E)

Under the Supply Chain Approach, a taxpayer would be precluded from claiming certain credits if the taxpayer received “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” This FEOC restriction would apply to (1) the ITC under Section 48E and the PTC under Section 45Y with respect to a facility for which construction begins after December 31, 2025, if the construction received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., since such facility would not be a “qualified facility”), and (2) the PTC under Section 45X, for taxable years starting two years after the Bill’s enactment.

The Proposal would define a “prohibited foreign entity” as any entity that is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-influenced entity.” And “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” would mean, with respect to property, (1) that a prohibited foreign entity provided, extracted, assembled, processed, recycled or manufactured any components, subcomponents or critical minerals (within the meaning of Section 45X) included in the property, and (2) that the property was manufactured using a prohibited foreign entity’s copyright, patent, know-how or trade secret.4

Significant Treasury and IRS guidance would be needed to understand the impact of the FEOC rules on taxpayers seeking to monetize their tax credits.

If the Proposal’s FEOC provisions are passed in current form, taxpayers sourcing materials and components from China (or other covered nations) would need to ensure they have an intimate understanding of their supply chain to ensure compliance with the FEOC rules.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing) Proposals

The Proposal would phase out the advanced manufacturing PTC for eligible components sold after December 31, 2031. This would eliminate the final year of eligibility that under current law is eligible for 25% of the base PTC. The PTC also would be terminated for wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The Proposal also would repeal the transferability of the advanced manufacturing credit for components sold after December 31, 2027.

If the Proposal is passed in current form, tax equity markets may be difficult to access for the Section 45X credit when transferability is repealed; as a result, taxpayers should consider financing options using direct pay — which, under the Proposal would still be available for five years — as the source to pay down debt or provide a return on equity.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuels) Proposals

The Proposal would make several technical changes to the clean fuel production credit and extend it through 2031.

Beginning in 2026, the Proposal would limit the Section 45Z credit to transportation and sustainable aviation fuels produced from feedstocks grown or produced in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. This proposed reform echoes prior guidance from the IRS, which commented on the difficulty of confirming the suitability and greenhouse gas emissions associated with foreign used cooking oil feedstocks. The Proposal also proposes to exclude greenhouse gas emissions from “indirect land use change” from the calculation of the Section 45Z credit.

The Proposal would eliminate transferability for any Section 45Z credits associated with clean fuels produced after 2027.

Given the lack of tax equity market for Section 45Z credits, and absent a corresponding extension to transferability, it is unclear whether the proposed extension to Section 45Z would provide a meaningful economic incentive to clean fuel producers after 2027.

Section 45Q (Carbon Capture and Sequestration) Proposals

The Proposal would (1) retain the availability of Section 45Q credits for qualified facilities that start construction prior to January 1, 2033, and (2) repeal transferability for Section 45Q credits if a qualified facility does not begin construction within two years of the Bill’s enactment. In addition, the Bill proposes to apply the FEOC ownership and economic-based rules discussed above.

If the Proposal is passed in current form, taxpayers seeking to monetize Section 45Q credits through transferability should ensure they begin construction on their carbon capture equipment within two years of enactment, since the proposed repeal of transferability for Section 45Q credits would negatively impact those associated with carbon capture equipment that begins construction after that date. Taxpayers claiming the Section 45Q credits for carbon capture equipment with respect to which construction begins on a later date could still consider financing options using direct pay — which, under the Proposal would still be available for five years — as the source to pay down debt or provide a return on equity.

Sections 48E (Technology-Neutral ITC) and 45Y (Technology-Neutral PTC) Proposals

The Proposal would eliminate the Section 48E ITC and the Section 45Y PTC for any qualified facility that (1) does not begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment or (2) is placed in service after December 31, 2028. The Proposal does not include any transferability restrictions with respect to these credits.

Under the Proposal, the Section 48E ITC and the Section 45Y PTC would be unavailable for any investment during the taxable year with respect to certain qualified properties under Section 25D (solar electric property, solar water heating property or small wind energy property) if (1) the taxpayer rents or leases such property to a third party during the taxable year and (2) the lessee would qualify for the Section 25D credit if the lessee owned the leased property. In addition, the FEOC rules discussed above would apply to taxpayers seeking to claim Section 48E ITCs and Section 45Y PTCs.

With respect to the Section 48E ITC, the Proposal would include a 10-year recapture period if a “specified taxpayer” makes certain “applicable payments” within the recapture period. “Applicable payments” would include certain payments (including compensation) made by a taxpayer claiming the Section 48E ITC in 2028 to a prohibited foreign entity that is greater than or equal to 5% of total expenditures related to the credit generating activity (or 15% of all expenditures if payment is made to multiple prohibited foreign entities).

If the Proposal is passed in current form, taxpayers constructing qualified facilities for the 48E ITC or the 45Y PTC (including accessing transferability) would need to begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment and place the facility in service before 2029.

Under the Proposal, projects that commenced construction in 2024 and currently are eligible for ITCs under Section 48 or PTCs under Section 45 should retain such eligibility. Those projects generally would need to be placed in service by the end of 2028 to satisfy the start of construction safe harbor. If placed in service after 2028, they would need to satisfy continuous construction requirements.

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen) Proposals

The Proposal would terminate the clean hydrogen PTC under Section 45V for clean hydrogen production facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Additionally, the Proposal would allow publicly traded partnerships to treat income from the transportation or storage of liquified or compressed hydrogen as “qualifying” income.

How does the ORD contribute to public health efforts?
Among the various ORD research centers, the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment investigates the health impacts of the numerous contaminants infiltrating our air, water, waste, and ecosystems.
For example, for a city to measure the amount of lead in its drinking water, its public water system would need to use an EPA-approved testing procedure.
But when it comes to public health goals, that can spawn major conflicts of interest.","The nation’s corps of federal health researchers is under siege. Drastic budget cuts, reorganizations, and reductions in force (RIFs) are hollowing out the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) to meet Administrator Lee Zeldin’s goal of slashing his agency’s budget by 65 percent.

The proposed plan would terminate 50 to 75 percent of ORD staff and reassign remaining employees to other positions. In the words of one agency scientist, whose position will be eliminated in July, this decision is “lobotomizing our agency” by cutting away much of its scientific brain trust.

Specifically, the EPA is ushering out a wide swath of biologists, chemists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, emergency response specialists, engineers, and other experts who focus on protecting some of our most basic human rights: clean air, safe drinking water, a healthy home.

Through the research of these public scientists, the ORD has been critical to the implementation of such major laws as the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Superfund program, which helps clean up toxic waste sites. The office provides up-to-date regulatory guidance and data to inform decisions on everything from how hazardous waste gets disposed to which emerging contaminants must be regulated.

Public health advocates like NRDC senior scientist Jennifer Sass point out that this loss at the EPA would leave a dangerous vacuum. It’s one that the government could fill “through expanding collaborations with chemical manufacturers,” she says, funneling our tax dollars into polluter-biased research.

How does the ORD contribute to public health efforts?

The ORD is the EPA’s largest office, and its span of work is massive. Among the various ORD research centers, the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment investigates the health impacts of the numerous contaminants infiltrating our air, water, waste, and ecosystems.

“They’re looking for answers to questions like, does this chemical cause cancer?” explains Erik D. Olson, NRDC’s senior strategic director for health. “If it causes cancer, what’s its potency? Can it cause reproductive problems? Developmental problems in kids? And then they come up with health risk values of that substance for human health.”

For instance, ORD scientists have been evaluating decades of research on the health effects of inhaling formaldehyde, a chemical compound that can be found in furniture and building materials, pesticides, insulation, car exhaust, and tobacco smoke. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but the scientists’ assessment concluded that it was even more harmful than previously thought, particularly in children and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

The office has also been looking at per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), “forever chemicals” that are now widespread in our daily lives. Studies show that PFAS can cause cancer, harm the development of fetuses and children, and pose other health hazards. But it wasn’t until last year that the EPA decided to restrict six of these chemicals in our drinking water. ORD’s research on PFAS toxicity, treatment, and destruction has been integral to the agency’s evaluations of many of these ubiquitous chemicals.

Public health advocates like Olson, who have been sounding the alarm on the dangers of PFAS for years, were hopeful that continuing ORD research would lead to tighter controls for the chemicals in all the places we encounter them. Instead, the EPA now plans to repeal its regulations for four types of PFAS and delay the restrictions of the remaining two.

There are hundreds of PFAS chemicals in use, many of which contaminate our water and air, and right now, EPA methods only test for 29 in drinking water, just scratching the surface. Without the ORD, there won’t be a standard way to monitor the vast majority of these toxic chemicals in the environment. The department’s researchers have also played a central role in developing methods to destroy harmful chemicals—especially pertinent for PFAS, given that they, as Olson notes, are almost indestructible.

“There will be a gaping hole in our safety net for protecting citizens,” Olson says. “Not only will we not be able to detect a lot of them, but we also won’t be able to figure out how to control them using up-to-date technology.”

And just how do the regional staff in all these places engage with their communities? Scientists working in the Duluth, Minnesota, lab participate in an annual educational program for students. Staffers in Corvallis, Oregon, worked with local farmers to demonstrate how to prevent water pollution while increasing crop production. And in 2024, the ORD signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chickasaw Nation to increase collaboration opportunities at the lab in Ada, Oklahoma, for sustainably managing groundwater resources.

Beyond the research that ORD scientists conduct, they also provide technical advice for local governments and industries on how to control, detect, and address environmental problems. For example, for a city to measure the amount of lead in its drinking water, its public water system would need to use an EPA-approved testing procedure. By standardizing these methods, the EPA ensures the whole country is using the same measuring stick, and that it is accurate and reliable.

The alternative is that scientific research is left up to individual states—a dangerous proposition that both Olson and Sass point out. Very few states have the capacity to take over the research that the EPA would do or to ensure municipalities are correctly implementing major environmental laws.

“Without these scientists, there won’t be anyone left to do the work,” says Sass, adding that there will be economic impacts to these cuts as well. “Businesses and industries save money when their workers are healthy—and alive! Without these research arms of our federal government, we’re creating this huge knowledge gap that will only get bigger over the next four years.”

Filling the public research vacuum: for-profit science

With increasingly fewer opportunities to conduct research for federal agencies—and now for federally funded universities, to boot—scientists may have to look elsewhere. That may mean working for groups with private interests. But when it comes to public health goals, that can spawn major conflicts of interest. “Often, it’s EPA science that will prove something as a problem, while industry science will miraculously claim everything they produce is safe,” Olson says.

In a recent op-ed she wrote for Scientific American, Sass highlighted the consequences that industry-biased science can have on driving misinformation about health threats. In 2016, after nearly a decade of research, the EPA found that the cancer risk from ethylene oxide exposure—such as from working at a facility that makes the chemical, working at medical sterilization facility that uses the chemical, or living near these polluting facilities—was 30 percent higher than previously thought. Sass writes that rather than accept this finding, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued its own alternative report on the chemical based on industry-funded science, which failed to fully account for the risk of cancer and could end up allowing more than 3,000 times more air pollution to be emitted from these facilities.

As Sass points out, we’ve seen this before from industry groups. Take Big Tobacco, which, in the face of rising cancer concerns in the 1950s, began funding its own research with the aim of allaying fears and keeping profits up. Similarly, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade association for chemical companies, has long used flawed scientific methods to undermine existing and potential rules for harmful compounds. Among the misleading PR campaigns for toxic substances spearheaded by the ACC are those for BPA, flame retardants, and formaldehyde.

“By going after science and research, this administration is attacking our nation’s brain trust,” Sass says. At its core, publically funded investigative research teaches us more about how the world works, she adds. It’s also an indispensable part of protecting our very lives.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/oil-refinery-highway-traffic-pollution-residential-homes-detroit-2201136693.jpg?h=bb2c13f3&itok=OMk6QZTM,N,,2025-05-28 14:14:53.164529

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule had caught on in other states as a more ambitious transition timeline than that set by the federal government.
Yet each of those states has debated or passed legislation delaying implementation of the ACT rule, as manufacturers have warned they won't meet the necessary production quotas.
The end of ACT comes after California backed off the waiver request process for a similar rule, Advanced Clean Fleets.","Federal legislators approved three Congressional Review Act resolutions last week that roll back California's strict truck emissions policies. The moves tee up the U.S. EPA to nix the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which would have required 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hailed the actions, noting Congressional Review Act rules mean that California can't seek substantially similar rules again in the future through an EPA waiver.

""We are glad to see that Congress recognized the truth, that EPA’s California waivers are rules that would create a negative impact on all Americans by driving up costs while limiting consumer choice, and acted accordingly,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.

California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph called Congress's move ""unconstitutional, illegal and foolish,"" in a statement following the vote. She promised more action in the coming days and said the state agency would continue working with truck manufacturers on zero-emissions vehicles.

""California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,"" Randolph said.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule had caught on in other states as a more ambitious transition timeline than that set by the federal government. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington incorporated the requirements in the 2025 model year, according to the RV Industry Association.

Yet each of those states has debated or passed legislation delaying implementation of the ACT rule, as manufacturers have warned they won't meet the necessary production quotas.

The end of ACT comes after California backed off the waiver request process for a similar rule, Advanced Clean Fleets. If implemented, ACF would have set additional strict transition timelines for fleet owners rather than vehicle manufacturers, with dates dependent on fleet type.

Veronica Pardo, executive director of the Resource Recovery Coalition of California, said via email that waste fleet owners will likely feel ""some relief knowing they have a little more time to ultimately comply with California’s push to zero emission fleets.""

Fossil fuels are the leading cause of energy grid blackouts. As the climate crisis worsens, America’s rising energy demand and increasingly frequent extreme weather events are leading to more energy grid blackouts. Some are quick to point the finger at renewable energy, however, renewable energy has actually become more reliable than traditional fossil fuel-based energy in recent years.

Take Winter Storm Elliott in 2022—where failing gas plants were responsible for 70 percent of its forced outages and coal was responsible for 16 percent, while wind production remained high during the storm. In places like New England, the winds blow strongest when temperatures are the coldest, and therefore, when the heating needs are greatest.

2. Investing in clean energy creates jobs and opportunities

The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act sparked a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and production across the country. In just two years, the 2022 clean energy tax credits included in this legislation spurred $450 billion in private investments that created over 400,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector.

A good portion of these investments have been in rural areas—bringing over $56 billion in investment and 64,943 jobs to those communities across 32 states. These aren’t just numbers on a page, they represent additional income for landowners, tax revenue for local economies, and new career growth opportunities for families that work in manufacturing, construction, and operations.

3. Expanding renewable energy leads to cleaner air, water, and a safer climate across the country

The connection has never been more clear. Burning fossil fuels releases dangerous levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and along with it, a combination of chemicals that form particulate matter. These particles cause respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, premature death, aggravated asthma, and cancer. Air pollution also poses a significant threat to wildlife, impacting their health, reproduction, and survival, as well as the ecosystems they inhabit.

Unlike finite fossil fuels that are being depleted at a rapid rate, solar, wind, and next-generation geothermal are renewable resources that don’t emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants when operating.

That means no pollution seeping into our air and water or heating our planet. Even when comparing to the total life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels including extraction, manufacturing, and construction, renewables still emit much less than fossil fuels. For example, from cradle to grave, coal-fired electricity releases 20 times more GHGs per kilowatt-hour than solar or wind.

4. Expanding renewable energy will boost American prosperity, security, and independence

Investing in clean energy will make America’s energy system more secure and competitive in the global economy. The cost of wind and solar has already fallen over the past decade, making them the most affordable new electricity sources and good sources of state and local taxes, contributing roughly $1.4 billion every year.

Based on current trends, China is set to account for almost 60 percent of all renewables capacity worldwide over the next five years. The only way to maintain American leadership and outcompete other countries is to diversify our energy system—which includes the expansion of renewables and an updated energy grid that can support our demand.

The United States must secure our energy independence, protect our grid, and increase our domestic supply of reliable, affordable, carbon-free energy sources. We are currently too reliant on energy from overseas that is subject to global price fluctuations and geopolitics. Investing in clean energy manufacturing helps bring supply chains back to the U.S. and grow quality, American jobs.

5. Fossil fuels are expensive

Artificially low prices of oil and gas are dependent on heavy subsidies from the American taxpayers. Although subsidies can reduce the cost of living and cost of oil and gas in the short term, the government may need to raise taxes, acquire more debt, and reduce spending on other public services in order to give those subsidies to corporations.

The reality is that the American people pay for fossil fuel subsidies, $750 billion in 2022 alone. So are they really making things more affordable? Not when you also take into account the health issues caused by air pollution or the economic losses of air pollution—$790 billion per year or around five percent of GDP.

6. Clean energy helps people and wildlife

Renewable energy offers an unmatched opportunity to help meet the challenge of climate change by reducing fossil fuel side effects: carbon dioxide emissions. Through responsible siting, advanced mitigation measures, and ongoing environmental monitoring, we can ensure that renewable energy sources support clean energy goals while protecting wildlife and local ecosystems.

By responsibly developing renewable energy, we can both protect habitats and address climate change by advocating for avoidance and risk reduction measures like limiting activities during peak wildlife migration times, using innovative technology, and thorough environmental review of possible siting and development impacts.",https://blog.nwf.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/11/files/2025/05/pexels-thomas-shockey-DeKalb-IL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:13:54.999195

For years, about 9,400 residents here have girded for the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant, a hulking facility bordered by dense forests and sprawling beaches, its smokestacks looming over the treeline.

Long, snaking rail cars full of coal from Wyoming were poised to lurch to a halt this weekend. About 250 workers at the facility were slated to be shuffled around to Consumers Energy operations elsewhere in the state.

In a win for Republicans and local advocates that pushed the local “Save the Campbell” campaign, Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday ordered the aging 1,560-megawatt coal plant to remain operational, at least through this summer, to avoid any possible capacity shortfalls or what he warned was a “risk of blackouts.” Fueling that push are rolling outages in Louisiana this week, partly because the Midwest grid operator was short on generation and transmission amid a bruising spring heat wave.

“I hereby determine that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes,” Wright declared.

Michigan has emerged as a test case for Trump’s first official move to buoy a struggling coal plant based on a rationale — the declaration of a national energy emergency — that critics say is questionable. Conservatives who pushed for Trump to intervene while flagging reliability concerns are now calling on Wright to extend the emergency order and keep the Campbell plant intact beyond Aug. 21. They’re also calling on the administration to block the closure of other coal-fired power plants, including the Monroe facility that pumps power into Detroit and the surrounding area, which is slated to close in 2032.

“Monroe is twice the size of Campbell,” said Republican state Rep. Dave Prestin. “Out of every one of the massive power plants in Michigan, Monroe would probably be the biggest one that I would be very, very upset with if we tore it down because of its impact.”

But the administration’s temporary orders won’t easily reverse the factors fueling coal’s demise, from cheap gas to waning demand and national shift to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Nationally, power generators are plowing ahead with plans to shutter more than 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by the end of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, though that figure is slightly exaggerated because it includes several plants that have delayed retirement plans. That includes Consumers Energy’s plan to close the Campbell plant 15 years ahead of schedule.

Consumers Energy, Democratic leaders like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and environmental groups have argued the closure is part of the long-planned evolution of Michigan’s power sector, one that delivers electricity without the planet warming pollution. They also say the move is poised to save Consumers’ customers more than $600 million. At the same time, Trump is taking aim at state-level climate and energy regulations. Whitmer has vowed to fight, declaring earlier this month at a conference in Detroit: “I’m not abandoning our climate goals.”

Greg Wannier, a senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said Trump’s invocation of the Federal Power Act is “an illegal abuse” of his presidential authority, one that will saddle the public with higher costs, and outdated and deadly technology. The region’s grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) — not Trump — is responsible for safeguarding the system and concluded years ago that the plant could retire without triggering reliability problems, he said.

Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, has said regulators will work with MISO and Consumers to assess and comply with the DOE order, but criticized the directive as costly and unnecessary, and said Michigan produces more energy than it needs.

“I think it’s a difficult case to make that there is, in fact, this local energy need that can only be met through the extension of that plant,” Scripps told POLITICO’s E&E News.

Norm Kapala, vice president of generation operations for Consumers Energy, said the decision to shutter the Campbell plant was reached through a yearslong, collaborative process overseen by the state of Michigan.

Consumers Energy has said it has enough gas capacity to ensure reliability and that closing the power plant aligns with Whitmer’s ambitious plan to phase out coal by 2025 and completely shift to renewables, gas and other energy sources by 2040.

“It really is the best decision,” Kapala said. “We know that reliability is paramount to our customers.”

‘Come and say their goodbyes’

The J.H. Campbell plant has been churning out power for more than six decades on a rural stretch of land near Lake Michigan marked by dense forests, hiking trails, boat launches, blueberry farms, and a smattering of houses and antique shops.

The boxy, beige building and its towering smoke stacks — named after James H. Campbell, a former president of the utility who built the state’s first nuclear reactor — has been a staple of the community for generations, and a source of jobs and revenue.

The plant also has a national reach. Down the road, rail cars filled to the brim with piles of coal from the Powder River Basin in the West are parked on tracks, waiting to be unloaded.

The plant’s closure represents a blow to the Black Thunder mine, the country’s second-largest coal mine. Campbell is the Black Thunder’s fifth-largest consumer of coal over the last decade, having received more than 23 million tons of coal from the mine on Wyoming’s high plains between 2015 and 2024, according to a review by POLITICO’s E&E News of U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Black Thunder is operated by Core Natural Resources.

Consumers Energy has been preparing for the plant’s closure, offering hourlong bus tours for locals to say goodbye. Visitors donning hard hats have funneled into buses to get a peek at the 2,000-acre site, complete with a tour of the plant and an elevator ride up to the fourth-floor turbine deck, where the steam created by coal-heated water turns weighty turbines, generating electricity.

“Our community does want to come and say their goodbyes,” Kapala told a local Fox News affiliate during a tour late last year.

Consumers opted to close the Campbell plant years ahead of schedule as part of a state-level legal process filed in 2021 — and approved a year later — that requires companies to create a path for meeting demand while complying with state environmental goals.

Scripps with the MPSC explained utilities in the state are required to file such plans every five years, including demand projections. The commission also has the ability to call on utilities to come in earlier if demand changes significantly and they feel the plan is inadequate. What’s more, Scripps said utilities have to project demand out four years and show they’ve got sufficient resources in place.

As part of the settlement, Consumers was also required to buy a gas plant in Covert County, extend the life of gas- and oil-burning units, add 75 MW of storage by 2027, 550 MW of storage by 2040, 8,000 MW of solar by 2040 and a one-time solicitation for an additional 700 MW of generation by 2025.

Scripps said the state has yet to see a spike in demand from data centers that’s often cited in calls for coal-fired generation to remain intact. If that does happen, he said the state and utilities have the ability to act early.

“Unlike a lot of other instances where plants have retired and there essentially was no plan, this one went through a fairly sophisticated, integrated resource planning process,” said Scripps. “Ultimately, the commission felt that the concerns around reliability had been sufficiently addressed with the new resources that were brought online as part of that plan.”

Plotting a comeback

Trump’s decision to intervene in Michigan arrived shortly after the president inked executive orders to revive the fossil fuel — and amid Republican outcry in the state.

In late April, Michigan Republicans including Prestin, state Rep. Luke Meerman and state Sen. Roger Victory warned top Trump officials in a letter that the grid would be increasingly vulnerable with the Campbell plant’s closure. They called on Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to keep the Campbell and Monroe plants open.

“A state prone to adverse weather conditions and prolonged winters, energy failings in Michigan have dire consequences and we write to highlight the critical concerns we have for our energy security,” they wrote. “Michigan is regulated by a radical renewable energy plan that mandates untenable energy standards by year, and the state has already begun to phase out traditional fuel sources like coal.”

Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga, who represents Michigan’s 4th District, which includes the Campbell plant, said in an email that any time a plant like Campbell heads towards closure, “let alone during a National Energy Emergency, people rightfully become concerned and wonder what it means for their home, family, or farm in terms of cost.” Huizenga also said the plant’s closure is “a costly example of Jennifer Granholm, Joe Biden, and Governor Whitmer’s failed energy strategy.”

Victory also reached out directly to the Trump administration, he said, and argued that the plant was needed to fuel growth in the region, including energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing. “I just don’t understand the aggressive nature of how, why it’s so critical to get that plant decommissioned,” Victory said.

On the local level, members of the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners have for months debated the fate of the plant. The 11-member legislative body sets policies in the rural swath of land that includes the Campbell facility.

Sitting in a conference room in West Olive earlier this month, Republican Ottawa County Commissioner Joe Moss said he and his colleagues were hopeful Trump would intervene to keep the plant open and said they were planning to explore legal actions to prevent the plant from being demolished.

“I do think the Trump administration will try something,” said Moss. “I just don’t know if it would be enough to stop what’s going on.”

But Doug Zylstra, the board’s lone Democrat, said his colleagues’ arguments gloss over the fact that Consumers Energy is saving $600 million by closing the plant, and that the utility has invested in gas over a period of years to ensure grid reliability. Zylstra added that no city or other entity has stepped up to throw out a multimillion-dollar financial lifeline to keep the plant open.

“It’s an obvious point to say it has baseload generation, but if it costs $600 million to stay open, is that a cost-efficient source of base load power? I don’t think so,” he said. “People aren’t lining up to give Consumers $600 million to keep the plant open — they tend to be lining up to tell Consumers what to do with their own money.”

‘Hard test case’?

Proponents of Trump’s push to revive coal hope that the Campbell plant is just the beginning.

They cite a 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment by the grid’s monitor, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., or NERC, which found MISO is facing a “high” risk because the addition of new resources isn’t keeping up with retirements and growing demand.

Michelle Bloodworth, head of the coal power generation group America’s Power, said that report and NERC’s call for utilities to better manage plant retirements should prompt the Trump administration to step in and study regions like Ottawa County before any facilities are torn down.

Demand is increasing, EPA is reconsidering onerous regulations, and the economics of coal-fired power plants could change, she said, noting that 19 utilities since 2022 have delayed the retirement of about 28,000 MW of generation.

“I think from a resource adequacy, fuel security, and national security standpoint, we need to keep every coal plant that we have until analysis tells us differently,” said Bloodworth.

A spokesperson for MISO said the grid operator doesn’t comment on individual generating facilities, but instead shares regional and zonal summaries. The most recent survey, released in the summer of 2024, cited uncertainties around grid reliability, with results indicating the region could see as much as a 1.1 GW surplus to a possible deficit of 2.7 GW this summer. The actual outcome, according to the survey, will hinge on the pace and quantity of new resource additions and projected resource retirements.

“Resource Adequacy risks could grow over time across all seasons, absent increased new capacity additions and actions to delay capacity retirements,” MISO wrote.

MISO notably has not requested an emergency measure to keep Campbell open, a measure taken by other grid operators when faced with major power plant retirements in recent years.

Federal regulators approved a plan in January to keep open a Maryland coal plant, saying its continued operation was needed for the reliability of the Mid-Atlantic power grid. In New England, they approved a similar plan in 2022, which kept a large gas plant open for two additional years.

Trump’s declaration of an energy emergency and subsequent executive orders inked in April appear to override the regional process, at least temporarily.

Trump signed an order calling on DOE to craft a new “methodology” to assess grid reliability by early May and to implement a process to determine which coal-fired power plants should be kept online in the following months — even through use of DOE’s authority under 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. The department since 2000 has issued or extended such orders 21 times.

Wright stated that the order for the Campbell plant is “limited in duration to align with the emergency circumstances,” but it’s not clear if the administration plans to extend the order.

Scripps said the directive took him by surprise because the state and Consumers Energy used a “holistic approach” to analyze the closure of the facility, and because MISO found in its last auction that there was sufficient capacity in all zones and all seasons for the upcoming year, a conclusion that accounted for Campbell going away.

“You’ve got the secretary saying there’s an emergency here, and the market saying ‘it’s tightening, but we still have a sufficient reserve and we have it across the footprint,” said Scripps.

As for DOE’s move to keep the plant online, Scripps said: “I think this is a hard test case for that particular power.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e7/d5/63b826ce4f4ea1ac04a200a4120a/election-2024-trump-14954.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:35.304410

Earlier in 2024, Senator Reverend Warnock was joined by then EPA Administrator Michael Regan at Stone Mountain Middle School to announce a $1 billion nationwide federal investment in clean energy school buses, including $60 million for Georgia schools.

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, Brownfields investments have leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

Ratepayer Fallout: Federal Move Forces West Olive Coal Plant to Stay Online

The U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order on May 23, 2025, mandating the continued operation of the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, despite its planned retirement at the end of the month. The decision has ignited controversy, with critics calling the move an unjustified burden on Michigan utility customers.

The plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was scheduled to cease operations on May 31, 2025, as part of the utility’s transition toward cleaner energy. Instead, under the direction of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the plant will remain operational under emergency powers authorized by the Federal Power Act.

Emergency Powers Used to Override Michigan Energy Transition Plans

The Department of Energy’s order is reportedly based on a national energy emergency declared by former President Donald Trump. The justification used to keep the Campbell plant running has been characterized by advocacy groups as fabricated and politically motivated.

“This is a radical abuse of the Federal Power Act’s emergency authorities,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, in a statement released the same day. “Forcing ratepayers in Michigan to pay to keep the inefficient, expensive, and polluting J.H. Campbell coal power plant operational… serves no purpose beyond attempting to prop up the dying coal industry.”

According to the DOE’s directive, Consumers Energy is expected to file a cost recovery application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This move could pass financial responsibility to ratepayers, potentially increasing utility bills across the state.

Critics Warn of Financial and Environmental Costs for Michigan Residents

Michigan ratepayers may bear the cost of operating a facility that was deemed economically and environmentally unsustainable. The Campbell plant, which has been a major carbon emitter in the region, was on track for decommissioning as part of Consumers Energy’s commitment to reduce coal use and shift to renewables by 2040.

“This decision could impact thousands of Michigan households already struggling with high energy bills,” said Slocum. Public Citizen has announced plans to file a formal protest at FERC, challenging the order and demanding oversight into what it describes as “an outrageous abuse of emergency authorities.”

Environmental groups have long targeted the Campbell plant as one of Michigan’s most polluting facilities. The plant emits an estimated 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to EPA data from its last full year of operation.

Energy Policy Clash Brings Federal-State Tensions to the Forefront

This action highlights growing tensions between federal energy policy under the Trump Administration and Michigan’s long-term environmental goals. While the federal government claims energy security concerns justify the move, state officials have not publicly confirmed any emergency need for the plant to remain online.

The lack of transparency around the emergency declaration has also raised concerns. Neither the DOE nor the Trump administration has released supporting data indicating a credible threat to grid reliability that would necessitate the Campbell plant’s continued use.

But many researchers fear that the order will do the opposite by putting US scientists and science under the thumb of political appointees — and they are mobilizing opposition.

‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts

The order, titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, states that research-integrity concerns, including high-profile retractions and an inability to reproduce many scientific studies, have caused the public to lose faith in science. It accuses Trump’s predecessor, former president Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence while crafting public policies on climate change, public-health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and more. The order comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for science across federal agencies and at major US research universities.

Although they agree that breaches of scientific integrity are important to address, researchers who spoke to Nature worry that language in the 23 May order opens the door to political interference in US science.

“It all sounds very non-objectionable, but it’s extremely dangerous” in the details and subtext, says Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The order “steamrolls” longstanding efforts to create a buffer between science and politics, says Goldman, who helped to develop scientific-integrity policies under Biden that the new order revokes. For instance, enforcement of the new research-integrity policies could be left up to political appointees rather than non-partisan career government employees, as required under Biden.

Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which coordinates science policy across the US government, said to Nature in a statement that the order creates a path to rebuilding trust between the scientific community and the public “through common-sense scientific principles”. She also accused the Biden administration of incorporating “radical woke ideology” into the scientific enterprise by introducing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. “If that’s not politicizing science, I don’t know what is,” she said.

The latest order has incensed some in the scientific community: nearly 4,900 scientists and others had signed an open letter at the time this story was published arguing that it promotes a “Fool’s Gold” standard for science. “The Executive Order further consolidates political control over the Nation’s scientific infrastructure, co-opting the language of open science to implement a system under which direct presidential appointees are given broad latitude to designate many common and important scientific activities as scientific misconduct, and to penalize those involved accordingly,” the letter says.

Competing policies

During Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, researchers and public-policy specialists repeatedly accused his administration of undermining science and censoring government scientists. For instance, scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were sidelined as the administration sought to weaken environmental and public-health regulations, and hundreds of scientists later reported political interference in a survey. Partially in response, Biden issued an executive order during his first week in office in 2021 calling on some 30 federal agencies to create or update scientific-integrity policies to shield government scientists from political interference.

Trump’s new executive order revokes those policies while calling for the OSTP to issue guidance within the next 30 days on establishing new ones; federal agencies then have 60 days to develop policies and report back to the OSTP. Among other requirements, the order directs agencies to ensure that their policies “protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions”. OSTP head Michael Kratsios and other Trump officials have said that scientific groupthink on topics such as climate change and COVID-19 response has squashed valid opinions and caused harm.

One of the main fears among critics of the order is that Trump’s new policies will allow agencies to put politically appointed officials in charge of investigations into allegations of research integrity. That could enable the administration to punish government scientists for failing to meet vague expectations to “transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties” when using data in agency decision-making. “This could be used as a cudgel to punish almost anyone: it’s just frightening,” says one senior government official who has worked on scientific-integrity issues under multiple administrations. The official requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.

Sometimes this type of financial juggling may entail using money allocated for other daily needs or expenses to pay the utility bill.

But a recent study by Payless Power shows that this is becoming a new normal for some households dealing with ""energy poverty.""

What is ""energy poverty""?

Why you should care:

""Energy poverty"" is the inability to afford essential energy needs without relinquishing other necessities like food or medication, according to a study by Payless Power. The report revealed that 57% of low-income Americans are dealing with energy poverty.

Energy costs consume most household incomes

By the numbers:

Forty-two percent of respondents in a survey from Payless Power said they spend 10% or more of their monthly income on energy bills. While 31% admit they had delayed or skipped buying essentials like food, medication, or hygiene products just to afford their energy bill. And 8% said they postponed paying their utility bill every month because they can’t afford it.

Separately, the study revealed 19% of Americans had their electricity turned off because they couldn’t afford it in the past year. Millennials were the most likely to lose power (22%), followed by Gen X (20%), Gen Z (17%), and baby boomers (11%). And 11% went without power for 1–3 days.

Another 65% of respondents said they felt increased stress or anxiety because of energy insecurity, compared to 44% who shared that they endured physical issues like sleep problems and illness from extreme temperatures (10%), while 21% felt ashamed or depressed by their living circumstances. Meanwhile, 25% said they lived in unsafe or unhealthy indoor temperatures to keep their bills low.

Study shows groups most impacted by energy poverty?

Dig deeper:

Approximately 60% of Gen Z and 59% of millennials living in low-income households admit in the Payless Power study that they struggle to meet their basic energy needs. Generation X trails at 56%, while nearly half of baby boomers (48%) are also impacted.

According to the study, many Americans are taking significant steps to reduce their spending with some of the main strategies being using fans or space heaters (45%) in their homes, unplugging electronics (45%), and skipping heating or air conditioning altogether (44%).

Moreover, the study noted that the state most affected is Texas, where more than three in five low-income residents report living in energy poverty. Twenty-eight percent had their power turned off in the last year, with cities like Houston (30%) and Austin (28%) seeing the highest rates of disconnection because of unpaid bills.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1280/720/person-looks-at-utility-bill.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:40.705538

With an LFP battery, GM is expecting to save as much as $6,000 on the Silverado EV compared to NMC packs.","General Motors' main battery suppliers, LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, are working to bring lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery production to the U.S.

All GM EVs currently use a chemistry called nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NCMA), which tends to drive up costs.

China dominates the LFP battery supply chain and has rapidly advanced the tech, which was invented and first developed in the U.S.

Electric vehicle battery production in the U.S. has long centered around the pricey nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry. But automakers are now shifting gears, moving toward cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to cut costs and make EVs more accessible to a broader audience.

General Motors especially is pressing ahead with alternative chemistries to lower the cost of its EVs. The Korea Economic Daily reported on Tuesday that GM’s two main battery suppliers—LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI—are planning to bring LFP battery production to the U.S.

If they move fast enough, these could be the first LFP plants in the U.S., potentially beating Ford’s CATL-backed LFP factory in Michigan to the punch. That plant was initially supposed to start production in 2026, but after a delay and some political headwinds, the timeline is no longer clear.

Samsung SDI and GM’s $3.5 billion joint venture in New Carlisle, Indiana, is already set to start building prismatic cells by 2027. But now, Samsung SDI will retrofit part of the facility—originally designed for NMC cell production—to manufacture LFP cells. The company is already sourcing raw materials and equipment for the switch.

LG Energy Solution, GM’s primary battery supplier, is also looking to convert a section of its Ohio and Tennessee facilities into LFP manufacturing, according to the report. Currently, LGES makes NMC pouch and cylindrical cells and has eight battery plants in the U.S.—some of them are already up and running whereas others are nearing completion.

GM previously announced that the next-generation Bolt EV and a future trim of the Silverado EV will also get LFP packs. But as for other models, GM hasn't said which ones will get LFP packs.

“Our EV strategy is focused on designing products that continue to lower cost, improve performance, and localize production,” a GM spokesperson told InsideEVs. “Battery technology is a key enabler of that strategy. We don’t comment on rumors,” he added.

Still, there’s a strong case for an LFP-equipped Chevy Equinox EV. It's already the most affordable EV in the U.S. with over 300 miles of range. It starts at $33,600 before destination. For commuters who can live with that shorter range, an LFP version could slash thousands of dollars off the price, possibly dropping it below $25,000 with the tax credits factored in. Alternatively, if those credits disappear—the Trump administration is pushing hard to do that—the lower-cost battery could help GM stay competitive and cushion the blow of tariffs, especially since the Equinox EV is built in Mexico.

That said, current GM trucks and SUVs use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NCMA) batteries. They’re an evolution of traditional NMC batteries with higher nickel content and a lower cobalt concentration. Even though these batteries offer superior energy density, they’re expensive and are part of the reason why EV trucks and SUVs tend to be pricier than their gas-powered counterparts. With an LFP battery, GM is expecting to save as much as $6,000 on the Silverado EV compared to NMC packs.

Several other EVs in the U.S. already use LFP packs, such as the entry-level Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Rivian R1T and R1S in their dual-motor trims with the standard pack.

GM is also looking beyond NMC and LFP. It is working on a novel chemistry labeled lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which uses less of the expensive nickel and cobalt content and dramatically increases the portion of manganese. GM will use LMR with a prismatic cell to deliver an estimated 400+ miles of range on its electric trucks and full-size SUVs at costs that are comparable to LFP, the company says.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAqbOl/s1/2026-gmc-sierra-ev.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:14:13.947755

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said.
Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.
Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement.","Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.

“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.'”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.

“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.

Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.

“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”

As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world. But, he suggested that state goals could be more ambitious.

“I was teasing in the other room, our governor wants to increase the amount of energy that we produce by double in the next 10 years. And if he were here, I’d put my arm around him and say, ‘governor, I love you. But that is not enough,'” Curtis said about Gov. Spencer Cox’s Operation Gigawatt. “There are demands coming on energy that far exceed doubling in 10 years.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.standard.net/images/2025/05/28110005/IMG_0960-scaled-e1748445478641-1536x878-1-1200x686.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:21.398741

We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy.
Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.
It's to create an entire nuclear ecosystem within the commonwealth that's taking advantage of all aspects of nuclear energy development: research, industrialization, building, parts, education, whatever it might be.","The latest wave of executive orders from the desk of President Donald Trump seeks to speed up the development of the country’s nuclear energy infrastructure and overhaul the industry’s safety regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed “nuclear energy nerd” – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky’s decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state’s nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump’s executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

“These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it's almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it's to that scale,” Carroll said. “That is the future.”

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment’s prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that’s still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by “no later than 2030,” though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump’s executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

“These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,” Long wrote. “The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation’s energy security.”

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump’s executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the “very slow and very costly” licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state’s largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

“Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,” he said. “There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don't think there's anything that couldn't be overcome with certain design changes.”

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state’s nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state’s Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky’s next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the “hyperscale” data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

“I think, at this point, the one thing that we're really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,” he added. “Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That's been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.”

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state’s baseload energy in years to come.

“To say that we're ‘headed towards’ a time when we don't have sufficient energy in this state – that's inaccurate. We're there. No question about it. We're there,” he said. “It's important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.”

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be “a brand new economic driver” for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with “a sense of urgency.”

“Our goal is not just to get nuclear reactors in Kentucky. It's to create an entire nuclear ecosystem within the commonwealth that's taking advantage of all aspects of nuclear energy development: research, industrialization, building, parts, education, whatever it might be. We want to take full advantage of it,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08b46d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4665x2449+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F57%2Fada6085b45ec9d7a536a978509bb%2F28074713764-554d1f9a4f-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:38.921749

Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed “nuclear energy nerd” – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky’s decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state’s nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump’s executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

“These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it's almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it's to that scale,” Carroll said. “That is the future.”

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment’s prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that’s still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by “no later than 2030,” though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump’s executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

“These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,” Long wrote. “The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation’s energy security.”

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump’s executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the “very slow and very costly” licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state’s largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

“Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,” he said. “There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don't think there's anything that couldn't be overcome with certain design changes.”

Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.
In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities.
Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful.
“Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said.","After days of intense political infighting between ultraconservative and moderate Republicans, the House of Representatives voted along party lines on Thursday morning to approve a sweeping tax bill that seeks to eviscerate the heart of landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats just three years ago.

The 2022 climate law on the chopping block—the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA—was the first legislation in more than a decade to attempt to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and was the centerpiece of former president Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, subsidies, and grants to utility companies, automakers, consumers, and others to become more energy-efficient and switch to sources of carbon-free power.

Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that lawmakers in districts receiving this cash would be disincentivized to undo the legislation supplying it, even under an ultraconservative president like Donald Trump. “Repeal is extremely unlikely,” Neil Chatterjee, a former Republican commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill last August titled “The Solar Investment Tax Credit is safe from repeal even if Republicans win in 2024.” In March, 21 House Republicans signed an open letter calling for any changes to the IRA tax credits to “be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion.”

Yet the House voted 215-214 on Thursday to wind down the IRA’s clean energy tax credits ahead of schedule, including the solar investment tax credit that Chatterjee was sure would be safe. Just two Republicans voted against the bill, one voted present, and two abstained—including only one of the March letter’s signatories.

Originally, the incentives were set to continue through at least 2032. Under the House bill, tax credits for all clean energies except for nuclear, which Republicans tend to view favorably, will apply only to projects that break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and begin sending energy to the grid by the end of 2028, a timeline that could seriously undercut the country’s clean energy industry. Federal tax credits to help consumers adopt clean energy technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles would be phased out by the end of this year.

The House bill needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump to become law, and it is likely to change during negotiations in the upper chamber.

Renewable energy developers warn that the House’s timeline for getting projects in service is prohibitively tight and would effectively make some of the tax credits obsolete. “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement.

The repeals would impact major utility-scale projects that are already underway, such as wind projects, said Katrina McLaughlin, an associate on the World Resources Institute’s U.S. energy team, because it takes a long time to get most renewable projects up and running.

“Placed in service means everything has to go right. We have interconnection queue delays, we have permitting delays, there can be challenges with getting different materials and resources,” McLaughlin said. “So getting in service by 2028 is actually a pretty aggressive timeline.”

In the two years since the IRA was passed, analyses show that federal funding has catalyzed more than $400 billion in investments in manufacturing, electric vehicles, hydrogen power, renewable energy, and other green initiatives and spurred more than 400,000 new jobs. Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.

As House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to unite his party behind Trump’s domestic agenda, two warring factions emerged: a far-right coalition focused on attaining deeper spending cuts by slashing the IRA and Medicare, and a moderate group agitating to retain clean energy funding in their districts and increase the cap on how much state and local tax can be deducted from one’s federal taxes—a change that would benefit high earners in blue states.

Unsurprisingly, the lawmaker leading the fight against the IRA comes from an area that hasn’t received much money from it. Representative Chip Roy, leading the ultraconservative crusade, represents a district in Texas that has a little less than a dollar per person in announced IRA investments. Meanwhile, one of his colleagues on the other side of the fight, moderate Republican Representative Nancy Kiggan, comes from a district in Virginia that is slated to receive $85.50 worth of investments per capita.

Republicans represent 18 of the top 20 congressional districts benefiting the most from clean energy investments since the passage of the IRA, according to the research firm Atlas Public Policy. The top three districts on that list, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, had together received nearly $30 billion from the legislation as of March this year. But in the end, all of the Republican lawmakers representing those 18 districts voted in favor of effectively ending the investments. Democrats, whose caucus has shrunk due to the deaths of three members this year, were united in opposition.

In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities. Moderates in high-tax states like New York were willing to use Biden’s tax credits as a bargaining chip for a higher limit on itemized state and local tax deductions—$40,000, up from the current cap of $10,000—a political win, with benefits that those lawmakers could reap immediately, that allowed them to sidestep having to defend legislation passed by a Democratic administration.

Republicans might also be banking on the fact that many of their constituents don’t know about the IRA. A University of Chicago and Associated Press survey last year found that two years after the IRA passed, most Americans had a supremely flawed understanding of what the legislation is and does, if they knew about it at all. Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful. Nearly 40 percent didn’t know enough to weigh in on the EV tax credits and a shocking 15 percent of those polled thought the policy—which gives consumers up to $7,500 for a new plug-in EV—hurt people like them.

According to Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way, part of the problem is that the IRA’s clean energy incentives—like new union jobs and major infrastructure projects—take years to manifest. “Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said. “It’s having a big impact, don’t get me wrong, but it hasn’t become part of the fabric of communities yet in a way that would freak people out if it disappeared.”

Car shoppers considering buying an electric vehicle in 2025 will have more factors to consider than buyers in previous years. Most of it is good news. For instance, automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs and improve their current models. Expanded charging options and very attractive used EV prices are also hot topics for this year. But there are also negative trends you need to watch out for. Edmunds’ auto experts break down what you can expect before heading out and buying an EV for 2025.

Higher new vehicle prices are a distinct possibility

According to the NPR article “ Here’s how Trump’s tariffs could impact you and your wallet,” the price for certain imported electric vehicles will increase with the Trump administration tariffs. Tariffs on other components or materials used for vehicle manufacturing will also have an impact. Estimates vary widely on how much extra you might have to pay should these tariffs be in effect for a long duration, but it could potentially be thousands of dollars depending on the vehicle.

The new administration has also said it would repeal the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs. Right now, certain new EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which can be put toward the sales price with a purchase or lease or toward your tax liability if you purchase it. Used EVs priced under $25,000 can qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000.

More charging options for EVs

Tesla charging stations, which used to be available to Tesla vehicles only, are now open to most non-Tesla EVs. This expansion includes Tesla’s vast network of fast-charging stations called Supercharger stations, and it’s a big deal because it significantly increases the number of charging stations EV owners can use. Public charging stations from various third-party companies like EVgo and Electrify America were the only options for non-Tesla EVs in the past. Tesla’s network of charging stations is nationwide and the largest in the country. The stations are also very reliable and are rarely offline.

Tesla stations can be easy to use once everything is set up. But you need to check with your vehicle’s manufacturer to find out how to use a Tesla charging station and likely buy or obtain a charging connector adaptor.

More EVs to choose from, and more range

EV shoppers have plenty of choices in 2025, and most of these models offer plenty of range. Many vehicles, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5, provide over 300 miles of range on certain models. Some high-dollar EVs from Mercedes-Benz and Lucid and electric trucks from GM easily exceeded the 400-mile mark when Edmunds tested them.

EVs are also becoming more affordable; a few have starting prices below $35,000 even without the federal tax credit, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. For the lowest monthly payments, consider leasing an EV. Automakers offer great lease deals during certain months thanks to big incentives and the tax credit.

The good and bad about low prices for used EVs

Even with federal tax credits, a new EV is typically more expensive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle. But the resale value of EVs — essentially, how much they are worth a few years after purchase — is dropping quicker than those for gas-powered vehicles. That’s great news if you’re in the market for a used EV. For example, 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GTs that cost more than $60,000 when new are now selling in the low $30,000s.

However, this big drop in value isn’t so great if you’re the one trying to sell or trade in your used EV. You’ll likely be surprised and dismayed that your vehicle is worth substantially less than what you bought it for. It’s especially bad if you owe a significant amount of money on your loan. It’s possible you could owe more on your loan than what the vehicle is actually worth.

Edmunds says

If you’re planning on buying an EV this year, it’s best to do it soon in case EV tax credits are repealed and in case prices increase. If you do purchase one, find out how to get access to Tesla charging stations because they are far easier to use than the various third-party stations.",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_547866107-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 15:32:53.499230

Previewing a challenging future for Michigan’s manufacturers, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently evoked Michigan’s storied past.

Speaking in Washington, D.C. earlier this year, Gov. Whitmer cited the Arsenal of Democracy era in World War II Detroit as a model of Michigan’s innovation and drive. During that era, Detroit produced an almost miraculous amount of output for the Allied war effort. Fourengine B-24 bombers rolled off the assembly line at Willow Run at the rate of one per hour. A single plant in Warren churned out hundreds of battle tanks a month.

Gov. Whitmer said, the task is to channel that historic period to meet tomorrow’s challenges.

“Today, we have a lot going for us, but our future is uncertain,” Gov. Whitmer said. “We have good cards, but good cards alone don’t mean jack unless you play them right. This year and in the years to come — no matter who’s in the White House — let’s bet on American workers … Let’s innovate and let’s build.”

Michigan in a Position of Strength

As stockbrokers are fond of saying, past performance is no guarantee of future success. Certainly Michigan’s manufacturers face many challenges, from the unsettled outlook for trade and tariffs to the slower-than-expected market demand for electric vehicles. But as Gov. Whitmer said, Michigan starts from a strong position, with a century of manufacturing prowess behind it, legions of skilled engineers and technicians, and a work ethic second to none. If you were wagering on the future, Michigan’s assets would make the state a good bet.

Manufacturing Prowess Runs Deep

Today, the state’s signature auto industry remains strong, with more than 1.2 million jobs tied to the industry, according to MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber. And these are some of the bestpaying jobs in the marketplace, with average compensation in the industry of $71,547.

But Michigan’s manufacturing muscle goes far beyond giants like General Motors and Ford. There are leading auto suppliers like Lear Corp., headquartered in Southfield, and Stryker, a leading maker of medical devices headquartered in Portage near Kalamazoo. And Michigan’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem has spawned startups like Orbion Space Technology, maker of propulsion systems to nudge satellites into their proper orbits, headquartered in Houghton.

Detroit is a Center of Startup Activity and Innovation

Michigan increasingly draws the eye of big-time venture investors who can bankroll future progress. During 2023, Michigan’s entrepreneurial startups enjoyed more than $1 billion invested into Michigan-based portfolio companies. And Detroit has emerged as a center of startup activity, ranking second among startup ecosystem growth worldwide, according to industry analyst PitchBook’s recent Growth Score research.

Where will innovation come from? Many places. There are hubs to nurture startups like TechTown at Wayne State University and Newlab at Ford’s Michigan Central campus catering to mobility startups. The University of Michigan is building its Center for Innovation at the Ilitch family’s District Detroit to house hundreds of researchers.

Michigan also has a major defense industry in Macomb County at places like the Army’s TACOM that manages the Army’s ground equipment supply chain, and Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a key defense hub and economic anchor that supports thousands of jobs and hundreds of military families in Macomb County.

Community Colleges Have a Key Role to Play

There are also the community colleges and universities turning out an increasingly sophisticated workforce.

And, as cited recently by Gov. Whitmer, there is the Michigan Maritime Manufacturing, or M3, Initiative, a job training program built in partnership with Macomb County and Macomb Community College to prepare thousands of Michiganders for careers in maritime welding and machining.

Referencing that maritime training program, Gov. Whitmer quipped, “Together, we can train thousands of Michiganders to do what they do best — GSD — Get Ship Done!”

When America Innovates, It Wins

A key strength: Michigan has leaders who continue to point the way to innovation and growth. As Bill Ford, Executive Chair of Ford, said when he opened the beautifully remade Michigan Central Station in Detroit as a hub of idea generation, “Five years ago, we set out to create a place that would accelerate Detroit and our region’s role in solving the most pressing mobility challenges and change people’s lives for the better. We see an opportunity to bring new companies and jobs to Michigan, while also attracting the best and the brightest talent for our industry.”

Or as Gov. Whitmer said in her recent speech, “The bottom line… when America innovates and when America builds… America wins.” And so can Michigan.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Detroiter_car_featured.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:47.618740

The climate sector can help | MIT Sloan,Betsy Vereckey,,,,,https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/workers-need-good-jobs-climate-sector-can-help,"In conjunction with business, policy, and labor organizations, the Families & Workers Fund developed a working definition stating that good jobs should: Pay enough for workers to sustain their families.
Economic stability Many jobs, including some climate jobs, don’t provide enough money to change people’s economic realities, Weissbourd said.
Economic mobility Good climate jobs should also offer clear pathways for advancement, paid training, and wealth-building opportunities.
“We have to be talking to the private sector because they’re providing many of these jobs and we have to be demonstrating to companies that [good jobs are] in their business interest.” 3.
Equity, respect, and voice Good jobs should provide equal opportunities and address discrimination where it exists.","Facing low wages, poor working conditions, and a lack of training, a third of working Americans can’t afford their basic needs. The transition to a sustainable economy represents a unique opportunity to address those challenges and create fair, well-paying jobs — even amid freezes to federal funds intended to support the growth of such roles.

Clean energy is a sector “where there are huge needs both for the climate issue and for our country’s workforce development,” said MIT Sloan professor , co-director the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research.

At an April event hosted by IWER and the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, Kelly and guest speaker Jenny Weissbourd, MBA ’18, a program director with the nonprofit Families & Workers Fund, discussed what a “good job” means in the 21st century.

In conjunction with business, policy, and labor organizations, the Families & Workers Fund developed a working definition stating that good jobs should:

Pay enough for workers to sustain their families.

Provide numerous chances for advancement.

Create opportunities for agency in the workplace.

Over the past four years, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act collectively pledged about $2 trillion in climate and infrastructure projects.

Those laws were projected to create about 12 million new jobs, which Weissbourd characterized as “an enormous window of opportunity to really support the transition to net zero while also moving workers into these higher-quality jobs.

“As it relates to the infrastructure and climate investments, we know that many of those dollars are now on hold, but many have already moved toward the ground, and we really want to make sure that they effectively support a clean energy transition,” Weissbourd said.

The pause in funding comes at a time when the climate crisis is creating “new vulnerabilities for people who are perhaps not fully covered by existing labor standards or for whom pushing for enforcement of existing labor standards feels risky,” Kelly said.

Even so, Kelly and Weissbourd expressed optimism that growth in climate jobs could help the country move toward a sustainable economy if policy and advocacy were to center around the following issues.

1. Economic stability

Many jobs, including some climate jobs, don’t provide enough money to change people’s economic realities, Weissbourd said.

“There’s a crisis around job quality,” she said. “I've talked to solar panel installers who have part-time work who don’t get benefits, who are out there on the roof every day facing extreme weather.”

Givng people the opportunity to earn enough money to support their families, receive health benefits, and work in safe conditions with a good schedule would move the needle on economic mobility.

The Families & Workers Fund, for example, supports PowerCorpsPHL, a Philadelphia-based organization that connects young people, including those who have been involved with the legal system, to quality green infrastructure jobs, such as climate resilience work in the city’s water department or its parks and recreation department.

“What they get is effective paid training, along with a set of other wraparound supports [and] mental health support, helping participants connect with things like transportation and child care, which we know can often stand in the way of successful completion of a training program and success in a job,” Weissbourd said.

“As a result, more than 90% of the people that go through this training program end up not just connecting to a living-wage quality job but staying in that job and advancing in that job over time.”

2. Economic mobility

Good climate jobs should also offer clear pathways for advancement, paid training, and wealth-building opportunities. “When you invest in the workforce, it helps you attract and keep talent; it helps drive engagement and productivity,” Weissbourd said.

She said that while federal funding for job training isn’t going away altogether, “I think we can expect a much smaller-scale investment than [in] the last few years.”

In this economic climate, it’s imperative that other parties get involved — not just the government, but private business and workers themselves, too.

“It’s about really showing the value to each of the stakeholders of this work,” Weissbourd said. “We have to be talking to the private sector because they’re providing many of these jobs and we have to be demonstrating to companies that [good jobs are] in their business interest.”

3. Equity, respect, and voice

Good jobs should provide equal opportunities and address discrimination where it exists.

“Clean energy jobs haven’t always included women and people of color,” Weissbourd noted. “There’s lots of great research on how diversifying your workforce can lead to really important business benefits.”

Add in a historic labor shortage and high rates of retirement in the workforce, and “it’s imperative to attract people from all walks of life,” Weissbourd said.

Kelly said that it’s important for workplaces to engage in open conversation: As we increasingly talk about what a good job should consist of, people can start to expect more for their futures.

“The more that there is organizing via labor movements of all kinds, as well as policy initiatives, then there’s a sense of being ready to push,” Kelly said.",https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-05/solar-worker.jpg?h=517d30df&itok=D63BAFA5,N,,2025-05-28 14:13:57.329228

“We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.
Curtis has also continued to rally around the tax credits.
Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies.
Collins is up for re-election next year, and while the IRA hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom.","The bill that passed the House would outright eliminate consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and both energy efficiency renovations and new energy-efficient homes. It would also kill the clean hydrogen tax credit at the end of this year and give most zero-carbon power plants, including wind, solar, and geothermal, an end-of-year deadline to start construction, among many other damaging provisions.

To date, at least eight Senate Republicans have spoken out against at least some of these changes, but none of them have tied their vote to the issue. The pressure to stick with your party is “enormous” when your vote is the difference between a bill’s success or failure, Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy at Third Way, told me. “As we saw in the House, the biggest question is whether any Republican Senator, when push comes to shove, has any willingness to try to stop this bill in order to defend energy tax credits.”

Pay attention to what they say over the next few weeks — and when they say it. It’s one thing to speak out when everything’s still up in the air. It’s quite another to keep talking when votes are on the line.

The Letter Writers

When the budget fight was first heating up in April, four senators led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune warning that repealing the tax credits “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The three co-authors were Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Last week, after the House modified its proposal to phase out the tax credits more aggressively, Murkowski told Politico the Senate was “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.” The moderate Republican has a history of supporting environmental policy, and has already broken with her party on at least one vote this year. In February, she was the only Republican who voted in favor of a Democrat-led effort to reinstate 5,500 federal public lands employees that had been fired by the Department of Government Efficiency. (The legislation failed.) Murkowski has also gone her own way to support more efficient energy codes, loans for electric vehicle manufacturers, and the impeachment of President Trump over the January 6 insurrection. But she did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and if you look at her overall voting record, these occasions of deviating from the party line have been rare.

Tillis, who is a member of the Finance Committee and will therefore be directly involved in writing the tax credit portion of the bill, has made more specific comments. He said he would push to wind down the tax credits more slowly to give businesses more time to prepare. “We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.

While Tillis does not have the same kind of track record as Murkowski, he’s up for re-election next year, and his state has a lot to lose. Some 34 clean energy projects worth $20 billion in investment and tied to more than 17,000 jobs came to North Carolina because of the tax credits, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. Toyota invested in an EV battery manufacturing plant and just started production last month. Several EV charger manufacturers are setting up shop in the state. Siemens Energy is building a factory to make large power transformers, equipment that is essential to expanding the grid and is currently in very tight supply.

Curtis has also continued to rally around the tax credits. He attended a press conference for Fluence, an energy storage company, back in Utah where he told the Deseret News on Tuesday that the House’s changes to the subsidies were “a problem for the future” of energy. “And I think if I have anything to say about it, I’ll make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future,” he said.

The Come-Latelies

When it became clear that the House was considering changes that would effectively repeal the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia chimed in to voice their concerns. Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

After the bill passed the House, Jon Husted of Ohio decided it was time to speak up. “You have companies that have already made investments, made commitments,” he told the outlet NOTUS. “Supply chains have been built around them, and we need to phase that out more slowly. I think that they deserve to have at least five years of that credit.” Like Tillis, Husted has an election coming up — and 35 clean energy projects in his state to protect.

The Wild Cards

The D.C. insiders I spoke to mentioned a few other powerful senators who could play a role in the debate who’ve been mum on the IRA so far. Thune, of South Dakota, has a history of being friendly toward tax credits for wind energy, and was honored by the American Council on Renewable Energy for his support for renewable energy in 2019. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Budget Committee, has also long been a sometimes-ally for climate action in the Senate. His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.

Susan Collins also came up repeatedly as one to watch, despite her not saying much of anything publicly about the tax credit changes yet. Collins is up for re-election next year, and while the IRA hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom. The Maine Climate Labor Council, a coalition of unions, estimates there are 145 utility-scale clean energy projects that are either operating or in development that could be eligible for the tax credits. The state has also made a big energy efficiency push in recent years, with the tax credits supporting the expansion of efficiency jobs.

Then there are the potential spoilers. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on the bill in order to send it back to the House and ultimately to the President’s desk, and the party has already split into a number of factions looking for various tweaks. Some, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, oppose the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said they will push to reduce spending even more.

In the House, defenders of the tax credits ultimately cared more about raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction than fighting for clean energy subsidies. We could see a similar dynamic play out in the Senate, where Murkowski and Collins have also expressed concern about cuts to Medicaid. The Senate also can’t afford to change the bill so much that it will lose support in the House, so any changes will have to be surgical. The calculation will be, “What is the smallest thing that the authors of the bill can give these folks to fall back into line so that it is relatively easy to both pass the Senate and then get back through the House?” Freed explained.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy. The North Dakota Senator wrote a letter to Republican leaders in early May railing against the “indefinite entitlement” given to energy sources that depend on the wind and sun, and arguing that the tax credits should prioritize electricity generators on the basis of “reliability,” so as to encourage “geothermal, hydropower, coal and natural gas with carbon capture, and nuclear without excluding wind and solar.”

Capito has barely made a fuss about the energy credits, but she and Cramer will be the ones to watch to see how the Senate deals with the bill’s provision to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, as both sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Capito is the chair. The repeal may not be allowed under the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, as it doesn’t have a direct effect on the federal budget. The Senate Parliamentarian hasn’t yet weighed in, but a negative ruling did not stop the two Republicans from leading the fight to revoke waivers granted to California that allowed it to set pollution limits on cars and trucks.

In the end, if any of these Senators wants to take a stand for big changes to the tax credits, they are going to need at least three colleagues to stick it out with them. A more likely outcome, Freed told me, is for them to attempt some smaller adjustments.

“Hopefully they can make it better, but they’re also under enormous pressure to not deviate too significantly from what the House wrote,” he said. “We just need to go in clear-eyed that it's going to be difficult.”

Editor’s note: A previous version of this article misidentified one of the signatories of the letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune. It’s been corrected. We regret the error.

At the same time, the administration’s ambitious goals come against a backdrop of reduced “personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility,” Jennifer T. Gordon, the director of the Nuclear Energy Policy Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, writes — all of which will “make it challenging to realize the full potential of the U.S. nuclear energy industry.”

2. EPA to propose that power plants don’t contribute ‘significantly’ to climate change

EPA

The Environmental Protection Agency is poised to propose that greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuel-burning power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change, The New York Times reported Saturday, based on a review of an internal draft of the document. The EPA’s rationale in the proposal is that the emissions from the sector are small enough that their elimination would have no impact on public health — although according to the agency’s own accounting in 2022, the power sector is the second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, behind only transportation.

The move by the EPA, while in keeping with the Trump administration’s deregulatory ambitions, also serves to justify its pending proposal to “repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants,” including coal-powered units. Previously, the agency had argued that Biden-era restrictions on coal- and gas-fired plants could prevent up to 1,200 deaths and 1,900 cases of asthma per year.

3. BYD slashes prices by up to a third

BYD

BYD announced steep discounts on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models between now and the end of June, with some price cuts as big as 34%, Bloomberg reports. The company’s cheapest car, the Seagull hatchback, is down to just $7,780, while the Seal hybrid sedan saw the steepest discount of more than $7,000, to a mere $14,270. Shares of BYD closed down 8.6% after the announcement.

BYD’s cuts aim to boost customer demand, with Citi analysts anticipating the discounts could increase dealership foot traffic by 30% to 40% week on week. But the analysts also appeared skeptical that the move by BYD would be hugely beneficial to the company in its price war with rival EV automaker, noting “competition remains relatively mild.”

4. South Africa proposes LNG deal with the U.S.

South Africa has proposed a liquified natural gas trade package with the United States, following a contentious meeting between President Cyril Ramaphosa and President Trump last week, Reuters reports. The deal would see South Africa import 75 to 100 petajoules of LNG annually from the U.S. over a 10-year period. Though South Africa currently does not have an LNG import terminal, the government plans to build one at the Port of Richards Bay, with the first phase going online by 2027, in order to lessen its reliance on the dwindling supply via pipeline from Mozambique. The U.S. will reportedly also help South Africa explore fracking opportunities within South Africa; the Karoo region of the country is believed to hold shale reserves, though drilling has been held off due to concerns about contaminating the water supply.

The trade package additionally includes an agreement for South Africa to avoid paying a duty on imports of cars, steel, and aluminum. According to Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, who shared details of the deal, it will amount to $900 million to $1.2 billion in trade per year.

5. Trump urges U.K. to abandon ‘unsightly windmills,’ drill for more oil

President Trump on Friday urged the United Kingdom to “stop with the costly and unsightly windmills and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken,” the Associated Press reports. Trump specifically cited Aberdeen as a potential hub for the “century of drilling left” — the same Scottish city where his Trump International Golf Links golf course is located, and where he unsuccessfully opposed the building of 11 offshore turbines before he became president. Despite Trump’s frequent complaints that turbines are eyesores, the BBC reported this weekend that wind farms have become an “unusual” and “surprisingly popular” tourist attraction in the UK.

The county is not relying on any federal funds to support the transition.
The City of Santa Barbara is acting equally calm and collected.","Senate Republicans gave California’s landmark plan to phase out gas-powered vehicles a big thumbs-down on Thursday. However, Santa Barbara County officials are unfazed. Local momentum toward the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is still going strong, officials say, and will not be significantly impacted by the Trump administration and Congress’s attempts to curtail the state’s transition away from gas.

For context, last week, Republicans in the Senate and a few Democrats in the House voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate — requiring all new cars sold in the state be electric by 2035 — and two rules cleaning up diesel trucks, saying they are expensive, impractical, and rob consumers of choice.

This marked the first time the state’s waivers to enact clean air standards that are stricter than the federal limits — allowed by the 1970 Clean Air Act — were revoked by Congress (in a questionable workaround move too complicated to explain here). But it extends beyond California’s borders, as 11 states were set to follow in California’s footsteps to reduce their own greenhouse-gas emissions.

While the state vows to fight the decision in court, Santa Barbara County is continuing its transition to EVs “pretty aggressively,” in the words of Garrett Wong, the county sustainability division manager. The county is not relying on any federal funds to support the transition. It already has momentum, Wong said, backed by funding from the state — including a recent $4.7 million grant — that is not at risk. The federal governments’ actions have a “chilling effect,” he noted, but “nothing is going to stop that progress,” such as plans to greatly expand the county’s EV charging network, in accordance with its 2030 Climate Action Plan.

The City of Santa Barbara is acting equally calm and collected. While its staff is tracking any potential repeals on EV tax credits, they are still “moving forward with our plans to electrify or decarbonize our fleet by 2035,” said Jefferson Litten, the city’s energy and climate division manager, including current plans to add 52 new charging stations at the city’s fleet yard. “If there are speed bumps along the way, we’ll deal with them as they come.”

County Supervisor Laura Capps was especially optimistic, still riding the high of the Board of Supervisors’ recent historic vote to phase out local oil and gas operations: “We’re on fire — no pun intended. We can channel our angst into what we do here. I feel as though we’re signaling to the Trump administration: Not on our watch.”

“We all understand that climate change will be combatted on a local level,” she continued, adding that local EV programs are “going to work,” and will not be impeded by the recent decision.

“We are full steam ahead,” she said. “What the Trump administration is doing has only energized local support for our climate action in terms of advocacy and awareness.”

Still, “Any reduction in funding for EVs and the associated infrastructure would have a negative impact on local air quality, specifically the pollutants the form ozone/smog and toxic diesel exhaust,” said Lyz Bantilan, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District. Governor Gavin Newsom also expressed concern that the Senate vote, which he called “illegal,” will “make America smoggy again.”

A dramatic legal battle between California and the Trump administration is expected to unfold in the coming months, with Newsom promising to “fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/County-Newsletter-2023-Department-Spotlight-General-Services-JPG.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:13:29.497245

“Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America – that ends now. Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades. We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy. These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies,” said Michael Kratsios, the director of science and technology at the White House Office of Science.

The executive orders “expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda,” according to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

On the first day of his second term as president, Trump declared an energy emergency, moving to reverse a Biden-era pause on new export terminals for natural gas and to expand drilling for oil and gas in Alaska.

Nuclear energy doesn’t produce the carbon emissions that the use of fossil fuels does, but it does produce radioactive waste that the country does not have the ability to permanently store, reported The Guardian. Environmental groups have expressed concerns about the safety of nuclear reactors, as well as their supply chain.

The executive orders are intended to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the purpose of advancing nuclear technologies and lowering regulatory barriers, while increasing the country’s nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by mid-century, a press release from the American Nuclear Society said.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” Burgum said at an event where the orders were signed, as The Guardian reported. “President Trump here today has committed to energy dominance, and part of that energy dominance is that we’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China.”

In past decades, accidents at nuclear plants both in the U.S. and overseas have caused public opposition to nuclear energy. And while Trump has described nuclear technology as “very safe,” the downsizing of the federal workforce by the Department of Government Efficiency, such as layoffs at the National Nuclear Security Administration — which oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal — has created issues.

The job cuts have been feared to hinder the cleanup of decades-old nuclear waste at the Hanford nuclear plant in Washington state, which was decommissioned in 1989.

Republicans in Congress have made efforts to implement Trump’s energy policies while reversing those of the former Biden administration.

This week, the sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. It alters the availability of tax incentives for renewable energy plants, limiting them to projects that begin construction 60 days after enactment of the bill and are finished by 2028.

This achievement positions Uttar Pradesh as the frontrunner in India’s green mobility push. The state’s success is largely driven by the widespread adoption of e-rickshaws, which make up 85% of its EV sales. These vehicles have become the preferred mode of last-mile connectivity, especially in urban centres, boosting both passenger and goods transport. The state’s EV growth has been reinforced by the Yogi Adityanath-led government’s EV Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, which aims to attract ₹30,000 crore in investments and create 10 lakh jobs. The policy focuses on accelerating green mobility, strengthening charging infrastructure, and making Uttar Pradesh a global EV and battery manufacturing hub.

Uttar Pradesh has also benefited the most from the central government’s FAME I and FAME II schemes, which incentivise the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. As part of its infrastructure boost, the state has approved over 300 new charging stations across 16 municipal areas. Ayodhya is set to receive the largest number of these stations, reflecting the state’s tourism-driven infrastructure planning. Despite India having 33,000 EV chargers, the EV-to-public charger ratio remains a concern at 135, compared to the global benchmark of 6 to 20. However, the UP government is prioritising rapid deployment of fast chargers and upgrades to existing infrastructure. With projections estimating 10.2 crore EVs on Indian roads by 2030, Uttar Pradesh is laying a strong foundation.

The state’s three-pronged strategy focuses on local manufacturing, public infrastructure rollout, and increasing adoption, positioning UP as a national and global leader in electric mobility.

With the vote, the resolution to revoke a permission issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December that permits California to require at least 80% of vehicles to be electric by 2035 is sent to President Donald Trump.

The decision is a defeat for California and environmental organizations who argue that the regulations are necessary to guarantee cleaner cars and reduce pollution, as well as a victory for General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab, Toyota (7203.T), and other manufacturers who vigorously opposed the laws.

In 2020, California first proposed a plan to mandate that by 2035, at least 80% of newly sold automobiles be electric, with up to 20% of those vehicles being plug-in hybrids.

California Governor Gavin Newsom declared, “This Senate vote is illegal,” and added that the Senate’s move would result in an additional $45 billion in health care expenditures for California taxpayers. “We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.”

Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act

Moving forward, Senate Republicans disregarded the lawmaker’s recommendation. In March, the Government Accountability Office stated that the waivers cannot be revoked by a majority of the U.S. Senate alone under the Congressional Review Act.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” stated John Bozzella, the CEO of the group. “In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla.”

Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, condemned the vote. “While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles, the world has already shifted under their feet,” she stated.

Tesla refrained from commenting right away. The vote, according to GM, will “align emissions standards with today’s market realities.”

Separately, the Senate voted Thursday to revoke the EPA’s 2023 approval of California’s plans to ban California’s low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines, as well as to mandate an increasing amount of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks.

These are the most current measures targeting electric automobiles in recent months.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a separate bill Thursday that would repeal car pollution regulations intended to encourage automakers to produce more EVs, eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, and levy a new $250 yearly fee on EVs for road repair costs. Additionally, it would phase away tax credits for the production of EV batteries in 2028.

It will be simpler for automakers to postpone or cease certain EV production if the courts uphold the revocation of California’s regulations. Automakers have warned that they could have to restrict gas-powered automobiles in several areas in the upcoming months.

According to California regulations, 35% of light-duty vehicles must be zero-emission versions by the 2026 model year. Given current EV sales, which are 10% or less in some areas that have adopted the regulations, automakers claim they are unable to reach that number.

Mitchell Schmidt | Wisconsin State Journal Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!","Federal funds that took years to secure to build out Wisconsin's network of electric vehicle charging stations are now in limbo after President Donald Trump's administration earlier this year halted the allocation of the previously approved dollars.

If the funding freeze remains in place, Wisconsin stands to lose out on nearly $63 million in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds intended to bolster the state's network of EV charging stations — particularly in more rural parts of the state outside of urban hubs like Madison and Milwaukee.

“The biggest part with NEVI was that it was solving that chicken-or-the-egg issue of what comes first: Is it the vehicles that get charged, or is it the chargers that get put in place?” said Ben Behlke, clean technology manager with Renew Wisconsin. ""The hard part with this is that the freezing of the funds is really affecting areas that have low adoption already, or it’s affecting areas that are rural. It’s affecting those areas that might have not seen this construction.”

The funding freeze was announced in early February and comes after a yearslong effort in Wisconsin to update state laws in order to open the door to more than $78 million in federal funds first approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2022 aimed at boosting the number of EV charging stations along state highways and interstates.

Legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March 2024 — a little over a week before the deadline for Wisconsin to secure the funding — opened the door to the grants.

The new state law requires private businesses to sell electricity by the kilowatt-hour — that is, by the amount used — rather than by the length of time it takes to charge a vehicle. The state in January also imposed a 3-cent per kilowatt-hour excise tax on electricity sold through an EV charging station.

Previously, a business that wanted to operate EV charging stations had to be regulated as a utility.

Shortly after the federal funds were approved, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced plans to build 53 fast-charging stations to support the more than 29,000 electric vehicles registered in the state.

By Feb. 6, when the Trump administration ordered a pause on those funds, the agency had signed agreements for 38 projects accounting for $16 million of the original allocation. Those include four completed projects, including new charging stations at Mount Horeb's Kwik Trip on Ridgeview Road, four other projects currently under construction, and another 32 projects that have been obligated and are actively moving forward.

Fifteen additional projects had not yet been obligated by the time funds were halted and cannot proceed, and nearly $63 million in the federal funds allocated to Wisconsin cannot be currently accessed, according to state transportation officials.

In early May, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul joined attorneys general in 16 other states to sue the administration to reopen the flow of funds allocated as part of former President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, arguing that Trump ""can't cancel part of the law by fiat.""

“The Trump Administration and Secretary (Sean) Duffy are singlehandedly trying to block Wisconsin from receiving the investments we were promised,"" Evers said in early May. ""It’s bad for the people of Wisconsin, it’s bad for our infrastructure, it’s bad for our economy, and it’s illegal.""

Duffy, a former Wisconsin Congressman and Trump's U.S. Transportation Secretary, responded to the lawsuit a week later, writing in a statement that the Biden administration ""failed miserably to deliver EV chargers despite their promises"" and the new administration is focused on streamlining the program.

""Congress gave the Secretary the authority to issue program guidance and ensure money is being spent efficiently, and that’s exactly what we are doing,"" Duffy said.

Steve Baas, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, said the organization supported the change in state law aimed at sparking additional charging station projects across the state, but he also noted he's not concerned at this point that those funds are gone forever. Baas said it's likely some, if not all, of the remaining dollars could open back up after the federal review process.

""That’s the only thing I’m concerned about with some of the litigation floating around out there, is that the people trying to make a point might end up actually delaying things further, rather than moving them along,"" Baas said.

Baas agreed that among the primary beneficiaries of the federal funds were some of Wisconsin's more rural communities.

""This subsidy money helped spur development in some of those areas that might have needed a little more time for the actual market demand to justify buildout,"" Baas said. ""But I think over time, as demand increases and the technology turnover happens somewhat organically, that demand will come back up to a point where it makes sense from a straight market standpoint, even without the subsidy.”

The offices of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, and Rep. Nancy VanderMeer, R-Tomah, who co-authored the charging station bill that was eventually signed by Evers, did not respond to a request for comment on the funding freeze.

""Dozens upon dozens"" of Teslas, mostly Cybetrucks, are sitting in front of a shuttered Bed Bath & Beyond in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

The city's planning head wants them out.

The parking lot of a shuttered Bed Bath & Beyond store in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills has become the resting place for “dozens upon dozens” of unsold Tesla EVs, a new report says. The growing number of electric vehicles sitting in the parking lot has attracted the attention of the local planning commission, which wants the electric cars out of there, according to Crain’s Detroit Business.

Most of the inventory EVs are Cybertrucks, for which demand has cooled dramatically in recent months, despite it being crowned America’s best-selling electric pickup last year. A few Model 3s and Model Ys can also be spotted among the unsold cars sitting in the former shopping center’s parking lot.

The city’s director of planning and community development said in a statement that the landlord of the property has “been notified that storage of vehicles is not a permitted use” of the land, and that “the enforcement process is being followed and takes time.”

The issue first came into view in an Instagram post from two weeks ago, where several unregistered Cybertrucks were filmed sitting in the parking lot.

Tesla Cybertruck sales have fallen off a cliff in the first quarter of this year, with the American EV maker delivering between roughly 6,400 and 7,100 units in the first three months. That’s a huge drop compared to the previous quarter, when Tesla sold approximately 13,000 units. (Though automakers tend to sell more in the last quarter of the year than the first quarter of a new year, the fall-off is still dramatic). This predicament cleared the way for the Ford F-150 Lightning to retake the crown as the country’s best-selling battery-powered pickup.

The situation in Detroit’s suburb isn’t new to Tesla. America’s best-selling electric car maker has been known to use private parking lots and even unused land to store excess inventory for nearby stores. Car dealerships often do this, too. In the Farmington Hills case, Tesla has a store just one mile away from the disused Bed Bath & Beyond parking lot, in the neighboring West Bloomfield Township.

The new store opened late last year in a former Barnes & Noble space, according to Crain’s Detroit Business, and is one of just a handful of Tesla stores in the state of Michigan. That’s because the automaker was not allowed to run its own stores in Michigan, as the state barred direct-to-consumer sales to protect its dealers. That changed after Tesla won a lawsuit it brought in 2016 to overturn the ban.

Now, Tesla stores can operate in the state. They just can't fill random parking lots with unsold Cybertrucks, apparently.

Some of the task forces, like the Artificial Intelligence Task Force, are a continuation of study by previous groups. Others, such as the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force, are new to this interim session.

Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne released the list of members and chairs they appointed to the task forces in press releases Tuesday. Like interim joint committees, task forces have both representatives and senators as members and two co-chairs, one from each chamber. Task forces are typically formed by a resolution of the House or Senate and make recommendations about legislation to consider the following year.

Osborne said in a statement that lawmakers will “continue to use our interim to address the challenges facing our Commonwealth.”

“Whether through interim committees or formal task forces, we are positioning ourselves to create policies that help Kentucky and Kentuckians succeed,” Osborne said. “The groundwork we lay now allows for more efficient and productive debate once the session is underway, reducing rushed decisions and increasing the likelihood of passing meaningful, effective legislation.”

A meeting schedule for the task forces has not been released yet.

The interim legislative task forces are:

Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force

The chairs, Sen. Shelley Funke-Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, and Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, were the sponsors of resolutions to establish the group. The task force will explore ways to implement directives from the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, policies. During a committee hearing on her resolution, Funke-Frommeyer said “this is our starting point” to start addressing Kentucky’s dismal health statistics. The commonwealth has high rates of diabetes and cancer deaths, maternal mortality and more.

Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force

This task force is the only one of the five with bipartisan co-chairs, Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton, and Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson. While Webb sponsored the Senate resolution for the task force, Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, introduced the House resolution. Webb said during the floor debate on her resolution that she had been working on the idea of the task force for some time, but the Senate considered the resolution on the heels of statewide floods and winter storms in February. Kentucky has faced more weather-related challenges, such as tornadoes and flooding, since lawmakers adjourned the 2025 session.

Artificial Intelligence Task Force

Both Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, and Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, chaired the AI task force in 2024 but saw more policy areas to explore when it comes to possible state legislation on AI. This year, the General Assembly passed initial legislation to regulate AI in state government carried by Bledsoe. The co-chairs were part of an April panel on AI and discussed ways the technology could be used in health care, energy, education and more.

States’ AI laws may be impacted by actions at the federal level. The budget bill passed by the House last week includes a 10-year moratorium on enforcement of state AI laws as a way to a patchwork of different policies nationwide.

Housing Task Force

Last year, lawmakers on the Housing Task Force compiled information to better understand the state’s housing needs. The task force is continuing this year under co-chairs, Senate Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson, and Rep. Susan Tyler Witten, R-Louisville. In a final report released ahead of the 2025 legislative session, the task force found that local elected officials are confronting a problem exacerbated by a boom of jobs in some communities and natural disasters in others. This year, the task force will review issues around housing availability, affordability and development statewide this interim session.

Moreover, ISC Konstanz head, Lejo Joseph, said that a “high percentage” of the Georgia site’s production equipment comes from German manufacturers. “We take pride in saying: A clean energy transition, made in Germany/Baden-Württemberg!”, he said.

Suniva is not alone in choosing PERC technology for its US cell production, when most of the international solar market has switched to n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology.

ISC Konstanz said PERC was “particularly suitable” for the US, “as it relies on proven, highly efficient technology to maximise production output, which is critical in supporting the United States’ resurgent module manufacturing sector and the overwhelming demand for domestic content in the country’s home markets.”

TOPCon technology has also become the subject of a broad swathe of intellectual property (IP) litigation. PV Tech Premium spoke with emergent US cell producer ES Foundry earlier this year, which said that it opted for PERC technology because of the number of TOPCon IP cases sweeping the industry.

Domestic cell content

Matt Card, president of Suniva, said: “The evolving US regulatory landscape places extreme importance on the need for domestically-produced solar cells.”

Indeed, last week the US House of Representatives passed a bill which promised to massively cut the incentives for solar PV deployment and manufacturing under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Crucially for the US solar manufacturing industry, restrictions on “Foreign Entities of Concern” (FEOC) could potentially cause huge disruption to the supply chain. Though the 45X Advanced Manufacturing credit was broadly preserved in the bill, the language around FEOC could render products from Chinese or Chinese-backed companies unusable. These products overwhelmingly dominate the global solar supply chain, and the US is still largely reliant on imports from abroad to supply its emerging solar manufacturing sector, which consists mostly of module production facilities.

“The main concern for the prohibited foreign entity provisions would be the limitation on receiving ‘material assistance’ from companies with ties to China or other ‘covered nations,'” Don Lonczak, partner at US law firm Pillsbury told PV Tech. He continued: “Basically, any component or subcomponent obtained from such a company could result in full denial of the tax credits.”

PV Tech Premium analysed the potential impact of the FEOC provisions in the draft House bill last week.

Suniva is one of the few companies producing solar cells in the US, which puts it in a strong position to weather the Trump administration’s apparent shift towards US protectionism.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ISC-Konstanz-Suniva.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 13:13:07.072231

The legislation now heads to the Senate Floor where it awaits to be scheduled for consideration and a vote.

This success is due to the bill’s commonsense policy, diverse stakeholder support from a wide cross-section of those engaged on this issue, and CASA’s continued effective and collaborative leadership on this issue that has now spanned two Congresses.

White House Transmits FY2026 Budget Request to Congress: Support Requested

Last month, the White House transmitted the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget request to Congress, marking the official start of the annual appropriations process and identifies the Administration’s spending priorities. However, while the budget request outlines what the Administration would like to be funded, and not funded, Congress makes the ultimate funding decisions. As a result, the budget request, in its original form, is often considered colloquially as “dead on arrival.” The new fiscal year starts on October 1. However, Congress has a proven track record of missing this deadline.

The budget request’s recommendation to reduce the SRF by $2.46 billion risks jeopardizing the ability for CASA agencies, and other clean water agencies, to fulfill basic public health and environmental protection responsibilities. Given the stated desire of congressional appropriations leadership to continue to support the SRF, CASA agencies are encouraged to underscore this by writing to your congressional delegations urging Congress protect the SRF in FY2026. Template letters for House and Senate offices have been developed to help with this outreach. If you have any questions, please contact CASA’s federal advocate, Sarah Sapirstein at ssap@ensresources.com.

Following the transmittal, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have begun the process of reviewing the request. As part of this process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Administrator, Lee Zeldin, testified before the House and Senate Subcommittees on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies to the Administration’s USEPA FY2026 budget request. During both hearings, subcommittee leadership, on a bipartisan basis, voiced strong concerns about the request’s severe cut of $2.46 billion to the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF), citing it as a critical program, and that it is imperative to continue to fund the program. While leadership did not specify a funding level for the SRF for FY2026, more details will be available in the coming months as the subcommittees draft their respective spending bills.

USEPA Unveils PFAS Action Strategy

At the end of last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the Agency will be taking major actions to address PFAS contamination. The actions are the first round with future USEPA actions to be announced. The actions are guided by the Agency’s stated principles of 1) strengthening science, 2) fulfilling statutory obligations and enhancing communication, and 3) building partnerships. USEPA offices, including the Office of Water and Office of Solid Waste, with jurisdiction over the identified actions will begin coordination efforts to implement the Administrator’s strategy.

In the April 28 announcement, USEPA outlined a series of actions to address PFAS contamination. Many of the listed actions align with CASA’s advocacy, policy and regulatory priorities on the issue and what the clean water sector’s role should be as a partner in responding to PFAS contamination. Most notably is the action for the Agency to work with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that operates on polluter pays and protects passive receivers. This action aligns with CASA’s priority that clean water agencies are not held liable for cleanup costs associated with PFAS contamination following their hazardous substance designation under Superfund.

Other notable actions USEPA will be taking to respond to PFAS that are relevant to CASA agencies and align with CASA priorities include:",https://casaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/USCapitol.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:34:48.207331

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Chevron shareholders voted against three stockholder proposals during the U.S. oil producer's annual meeting on Wednesday, including one calling for a report on the company's human rights practices, while larger rival Exxon Mobil faced no investor resolutions for the first time in decades.

There have been fewer resolutions on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters this year than they did in 2024 and 2023 due to lack of investor appetite for such proposals. Lower-than-expected returns in renewable energy projects have also shifted shareholders' focus back to oil and gas.

Chevron investors rejected a resolution that would have allowed holders of at least 10% of the company's common stock to call special meetings. They also voted down a proposal to produce a report about whether company investments in renewable energy could result in so-called stranded assets, or projects that lose value prematurely, according to preliminary voting results on Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, Exxon's annual meeting featured no qualifying shareholder resolutions for the first time since 1958.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods said he attributed that to the company's performance that has outpaced competitors, and to Exxon's willingness to fight back against proposals he said were a detriment to the business.

Investors approved all director nominees and executive compensation plans for both companies.

John McElroy is an influential thought leader in the automotive industry.","The U.S. auto industry used to dominate the global market. Today, we’re playing second fiddle to China. Unless we come up with a national strategy that ensures a vibrant industry, we’re going to end up losing what’s left.

The traditional auto industry is nearing a breaking point. The old order is starting to crumble due to a combination of seven unprecedented changes.

First, we’ve hit Peak Auto. New car sales were higher 25 years ago than today, even though the U.S. population has grown by 58 million people. If the same percentage of Americans bought a new car as they did in the year 2000, automakers would have sold 22 million vehicles last year, not 16 million. The trend lines suggest we’ll never go back to previous levels.

Second, technology is upending the way cars are designed, engineered and manufactured. Software defined vehicles, zonal-centralized computing platforms and digital twins are obsoleting the old way of doing things.

Third, the industry invested billions of dollars in electric vehicles that haven’t paid off. While EV sales continue to grow, they’re not growing fast enough. Worse, for the auto industry, Congress just eliminated EV incentives.

Fourth, the talent shortage. President Donald Trump wants to bring back manufacturing, but who’s going to work in the factories? Every company I visit says their Number One problem is getting the people they need. There are currently half a million manufacturing jobs nationwide going begging.

Fifth, China. The country now leads the global auto industry in technology, innovation and speed to market. While Chinese automakers are effectively banned from the U.S. market, they’re on a global export binge like we’ve never seen before.

Sixth, tariffs. They have crippled the highly efficient North American supply chain. Tariffs may buy time for Americans to catch up to the Chinese, but they do nothing to solve the problems listed here.

Seventh, government regulations. The EPA is focusing on CO2 regulations. NHTSA sets fuel economy regulations. But the only way we know how to cut CO2 emissions is by burning less fuel, which is effectively a fuel economy regulation. The EPA’s CO2 regulations and NHTSA’s CAFE regulations are trying to achieve the same thing, but with different targets, timetables and procedures.

Here’s a suggestion. Why not get rid of NHTSA’s CAFE standard and simply rely on the EPA’s CO2 standards? The end result will be about the same, but it would get rid of a ton of regulation.

Meanwhile, NHTSA writes safety regulations that add more structure and safety technology to cars that makes them heavier, which means they burn more fuel and emit more emissions. And yet, even with all this safety equipment, traffic fatalities are 30% higher than before that equipment was added. It seems like we need to rethink the whole approach.

Instead of different agencies writing rules that duplicate each other, or even conflict, why not establish one Office of Automotive Regulation? It could issue regulations that are stable and predictable. I believe we can regulate the auto industry a lot more efficiently and still achieve world-class levels of clean air, fuel efficiency and vehicle safety.

All the problems the auto industry faces are invisible to the general public and the country’s political leadership. When it comes to lobbying in Washington, D.C., the industry punches well below its weight. Imagine if the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the OEMs), the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (the suppliers), the National Auto Dealers Association and the UAW all spoke with one voice. They could exert enormous political power.

It is in the self-interest of the United States to have a healthy and vibrant automotive industry. It is an economic engine for the economy and critical to the country's national defense. It’s time for a comprehensive national strategy to keep it that way. We lose by waiting, so let’s get going.

That’s good news for the offshore wind industry, which had already been struggling with elevated financing costs.
Videll’s company, Sea Services, helps ensure that offshore wind construction doesn’t damage undersea cables or other infrastructure.
The Republican budget bill could also eliminate federal tax credits for offshore wind, said Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind energy research at BloombergNEF.

That’s good news for the offshore wind industry, which had already been struggling with elevated financing costs. But with the budget bill under debate in Congress, the industry still faces a difficult political environment.

One person who’s happy that Empire Wind is back under construction is Gordon Videll.

“Literally this morning we just got another contract, so things are looking good,” he said.

Videll’s company, Sea Services, helps ensure that offshore wind construction doesn’t damage undersea cables or other infrastructure.

“We provide safety vessels to make sure the assets are protected,” he said.

And while Videll is glad to work on the $5 billion Empire Wind project, expected to power half a million homes, he’s less confident about what comes next.

“After these projects, there’s probably gonna be a lull,” he said.

Because all the policy whiplash, he said, could chill new investment. President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at halting offshore wind, even as he declared the country to be in an energy emergency.

David Victor, an energy researcher at UC San Diego, said offshore wind projects already take years to plan and finance, and the federal government’s stance isn’t helping.

“You’re not quite sure what they’re doing or why they’re doing, or whether they’re gonna come after you next,” Victor said.

The Republican budget bill could also eliminate federal tax credits for offshore wind, said Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind energy research at BloombergNEF.

“If we see the end of tax credits, then making the economic case for any future projects would be very, very difficult,” Metcalfe said.

This could put a dent in domestic manufacturing too. Kris Ohleth heads the think tank Special Initiative on Offshore Wind. And she said companies had announced plans to build equipment here in the U.S., including underwater transmission cables.

Now though, “The policies of the Trump administration are actually pushing these supply chain and manufacturing companies to other countries,” Ohleth said.

But, she said, states remain committed to offshore wind. Especially in the northeast, where demand for energy is high, but there’s not much room for siting projects on land.

“Yes, it's a three to four year delay from the federal level, but there is a lot of work to be done on the state side,” said Alicia Gené Artessa with the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. “And so we can work on building out our transmission infrastructure.”

So that someday down the line, she said, the state will be ready to buy power from a new crop of offshore wind projects.",https://img.apmcdn.org/245bc7d3edfb4f96b1ff2eabf2740ae1cb03b5df/widescreen/a93935-20250528-waters-off-block-island-host-america-s-first-offshore-wind-farm-2000.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 12:27:16.322310

Since then, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued three additional orders related to electricity generation or transmission in Puerto Rico (here and here) and Michigan (here) under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (FPA).

These orders aim to ensure grid reliability amidst challenges involving weather, infrastructure, and shifts in energy policy. As we discuss below, while these orders may appear ideological, they are targeted to specific local problems that could cause blackouts.

Resilience in US Generation Policy

Federal and state governments, along with private actors, play crucial roles in US electric generation policymaking. The DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) set national energy policies, while state governments implement local priorities, leading to a diverse energy landscape. Weather impacts both electric demand and infrastructure itself. Federal and state officials share the responsibility to responding to weather events, with federal officials responsible for setting standards for resilience projects, funding initiatives, and coordinating emergency response.

In April, the president issued an Executive Order titled “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,” which expanded the role of the federal government in energy policy. Specifically, it authorized the use of emergency powers to require existing fossil fuel-fired power plants to stay online. Citing its earlier declaration of a “National Energy Emergency,” the Administration preemptively invoked Section 202 of the FPA, which allows FERC to require specific energy generation or facility interconnection to meet energy demands in times of war or emergency. The three orders discussed below are the first the Administration has issued under this authority.

May 16 Puerto Rico Orders

Puerto Rico’s electrical grid faces challenges stemming both from geography (i.e., being a tropical island without fossil fuel resources) as well as history (e.g., underinvestment and weather events, including three hurricanes and major earthquakes in the past decade). In April, following an island-wide blackout, the governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Order EO-2025-016, declaring a state of emergency for Puerto Rico’s electric system.

On May 16, citing Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The first order sets out emergency measures for generation and the second sets out emergency measures for transmission. The orders together compel short-term actions to address well-known risks to the stability of Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

The risks are both recently chronicled and not in dispute. This year, a systems analysis, conducted by Puerto Rican officials, determined that any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power. To minimize potential power losses, DOE ordered that 34 fossil-fuel fired units, some of them mothballed, be made available for 90 days (subject to being extended) to promote grid reliability.

In terms of transmission, DOE’s order also notes that Puerto Rico’s transmission lines are “currently operated with up to 70% derating to avoid failures from infrastructure conditions (e.g. line sagging into vegetation)” and that lack of vegetation control on transmission and distribution rights-of-ways is “one of the main causes of power failures.” Localized transmission failures can cascade into larger issues. Accordingly, DOE ordered PREPA to reestablish rights-of-way by managing vegetation and report back to DOE on its progress in 90 days, with DOE deploying regulatory heft to addressing long-term issues to the Puerto Rico electric grid.

The Michigan Order

A week later, DOE issued an emergency order to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy directing them to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant [set to close on May 31, 2025] is available to operate.” The Campbell plant was rated to produce 1,560 MW of electricity. This order trumps a state order — supported by the facility owner — to shut down the plant.

The Michigan order noted that “[m]ultiple generation facilities in Michigan have retired in recent years” and since “2020, about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity have been retired and no new coal-fired facilities are planned.” Indeed, since the middle of 2024, 1,575 megawatts of capacity were retired. A regulatory assessment issued May 14 forecast an increased potential for regulatory shortfalls. To address these forecasted shortfalls, the order requires that, for a period of 90 days, MISO and Consumers must “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate. For the duration of this order, MISO is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” The essential effect of this order is that the Campbell Plant will continue to operate for at least the next 90 days to better allow DOE to understand whether shutting down the plant will negatively affect the overall electric grid.

What to Watch

We’ve talked a lot about the Administration’s energy deregulation. How do the DOE orders listed above fit within that deregulation scheme? Here are three notable points about how they may be consistent:

1. The Orders are Not Necessarily Ideological

It is easy to see power generation as an ideological issue particularly in light of the Administration’s desire to “Reinvigorate America’s Beautiful Clean Coal.” But, at least in the short term, fossil fuel generation would continue in Puerto Rico as it always has because, according to federal regulators, fossil fuel plants accounted for 93% of Puerto Rico’s generation capacity in 2024, with petroleum-fired power plants themselves accounting for 62%. Rather than encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels, the orders largely seem focused on minimizing blackouts.

2. Local Control of Power Generation Isn’t Ending

The orders likely reflect a cautious approach intended to promote grid stability and likely do not themselves address the transition from fossil fuels. The orders in both states react to local conditions, such as recent grid instability in Puerto Rico and Michigan’s spate of fossil fuel resource retirement. In both locations, the orders are at least nominally consistent with local political realities. The transmission-focused order in Puerto Rico indicates that some of the concerns raised in the order originated at recent meetings with local stakeholders. Puerto Rican government officials reportedly supported the orders. In Michigan, this order followed a May 7 county commission resolution requesting that state regulators postpone the plant’s retirement.

3. The Orders Will Last Longer Than Previous 202(c) Orders

Finally, the FPA 202(c) orders here initially last 90 days with requirements for reporting back to DOE. When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather. (See examples here and here.) During the first Administration DOE entertained (but denied) a request from coal-related generation concerns to keep a number of coal-fired plants running for grid reliability concerns using the same provision.

The Puerto Rico and Michigan orders were issued under FPA Section 202(c) and were intended to address “emergency” situations, rather than FPA Section 202(b), which federal regulators have historically used to improve operational efficiency and reliability of the electric grid under non-emergency conditions. The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.",https://www.afslaw.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-02/ENERGY_CLEANTECH_0.jpg.webp?itok=nqrBfGUs,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:42.343969

In parallel, the House of Representatives' budget bill limits availability of most non-nuclear tax credits.

Nuclear Executive Orders

On May 23, 2025, President Trump issued four Executive Orders, entitled ""Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base"", ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"", ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"", and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"", which intend to broadly expand and support the production and use of nuclear energy with the goal of reestablishing the United States as a global leader in the sector. The Executive Orders mandate multiple governmental agencies to identify the current state of nuclear fuel, waste disposal and uranium conversion capacity, and recommend policies to improve these capabilities, reduce regulation where possible, and provide for government funding of nuclear projects and their related supply chains. The Executive Orders also mandate the acceleration of the licensing approval process for new nuclear reactors and the creation of a pilot program for reactor construction and operation.

These Executive Orders demonstrate the importance the current administration places on nuclear energy, which is considered crucial to support energy intensive industries, particularly data centers for artificial intelligence. According to the International Energy Agency, ""China and the United States are the most significant regions for data center electricity consumption growth, accounting for nearly 80% of global growth to 2030, with a consumption increase of around 240 TWh (up 130%) compared to the 2024 level"".1

Adapting the legal and regulatory framework to accelerate the development and deployment of nuclear technologies and increase the use of nuclear power in the energy mix has become a national priority in the United States.

Strengthening and Financing the Nuclear Fuel Cycle

As nuclear has made a dramatic comeback these last few years after decades of disinterest, the nuclear sector needs to rebuild not only its supply chain but also its workforce. These last few years have seen a resurgence of innovation through the development of numerous new reactors by historic nuclear vendors (i.e. Westinghouse and GE-Hitachi), national laboratories (i.e. Idaho and Oak Ridge) and start-ups (i.e. Holtec, NuScale, Last Energy and X-Energy). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (""IAEA""), over 20 small modular reactor (""SMR"") designs are currently under development in the U.S., and around 15 SMR start-ups have been established—highlighting the vibrant innovation driving the American nuclear sector.

The ""Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base"" Executive Order includes provisions that strengthen educational pathways in the industry and increases potential funding of nuclear projects. The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Energy, through the Loan Programs Office of the Department of Energy (""DOE""), to prioritize making available resources for restarting closed nuclear power plants, increase power output of operating nuclear power plants, complete construction of nuclear reactors that were prematurely suspended, construct new advanced SMRs, and improve the nuclear fuel supply chain. By the end of this year, the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration must prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear reactor technologies through grants, loans, investment capital, funding opportunities, and other available support. In this respect, the DOE is also instructed to prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. One of the latest initiatives to fund the nuclear sector has been the DOE's Generation III+ SMR program2, which is intended to fund up to US$ 900 million for the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors by scaling the production and deployment of reactors to stimulate nuclear industry.

The Executive Order further directs the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads, to issue a report by January 18, 2026, with recommendations regarding:

the management of nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of fuel cycle capabilities (since the termination of the project to locate a deep geological repository (""DGR"") in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, there has been no other project regarding the final disposal of high-level waste in the U.S. Worldwide, there is currently one finalized DGR in Finland, and two under construction in France and Sweden);

the reprocessing and recycling of nuclear fuel, including the efficient use and disposal of uranium and other products recovered through such processes. The U.S. does not reprocess nor recycle its nuclear fuel. While several European countries (including France and the United Kingdom), Russia, China and Japan have policies to reprocess used fuel, only a few countries actually have a reprocessing capacity currently (i.e. France, India, Russia and the United Kingdom);

plans for decommissioning existing nuclear reactors, to make the process more efficient;

the methods and technologies to transport used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors, domestically and overseas. Without the necessary transportation capacity to support an increase of nuclear material transportation around the world, including the carriage of sealed micro-reactors containing nuclear fuel, it will be difficult to operate national and international nuclear projects.

In addition, the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads and the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC""), is directed to develop, by September 20, 2025, a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and enrichment capabilities to meet both civilian and defense reactor needs. This aims to complement the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act of 2024, which is currently implemented with a number of waivers that may be applied for until January 1, 2028.3

Facilitating National and International Deployment of U.S. Nuclear Reactors

The Executive Orders on ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"" and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"" emphasize the importance of civilian nuclear power and the national security importance of reliable nuclear energy. These Executive Orders seek to strengthen the nuclear reactor infrastructure and increase nuclear exports. They add to the framework established by the International Nuclear Energy Act (""INEA"") and the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act (""ADVANCE Act""), both of 2023.

The Executive Orders on ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"" and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"" both task the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads, to determine before the fall 2025:

a regulatory and procedural infrastructure that expedites the review, approval, and deployment of qualifying advanced test reactors to operate at DOE owned or controlled facilities within 2 years following a substantially complete application.

eliminate or expedite environmental reviews, including determining which DOE functions are not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (""NEPA""), creating categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), and relying on supplemental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites.

a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside of National Laboratories, with at least three being approved and achieving criticality by July 4, 2026.

determine a strategy that optimizes the financial support that the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank and other relevant agencies may provide to projects of national strategic interest developed by recently graduated high income economies utilizing U.S. civil nuclear technology.

The Secretary of State is also directed to pursue at least 20 Agreements for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation (or ‘123 Agreements') by the close of the 120th Congress (January 3, 2029) to enable the U.S. nuclear industry to access new markets in partner countries and fully leverage the resources of the Federal Government to promote the United States nuclear industry in the development of commercial civil nuclear projects globally. The United States has entered into 25 ‘123 Agreements' covering 49 countries and Taiwan to date.

The Secretaries of Energy and State must now, subject to consultation with the NRC, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense, approve or deny technology transfer export authorization requests within 30 days of receipt of a complete application and completion by the DOE of the required accompanying analysis, excluding any time period waiting for (i) concurrence from the Department of State; and (ii) retransfer and nonproliferation assurances to be received from the government of the country where the export is proposed to be sent.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reform

The NRC was already directed by the 2019 Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (""NEIMA"") and the ADVANCE Act to streamline the process and lower costs for licensing of advanced nuclear reactors by for example reducing the licensing fees for advanced SMRs, eliminating the costs for pre-application activities and early site permits at the DOE sites or other locations implicating national security, and initiating rulemaking to support the development of small modular reactors on brownfield sites such as retired coal-fired power facilities.

The Executive Order on ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"" intends to ensure that the NRC commits to the following along with other related objectives:

to consider the benefits of increased availability of and innovation in nuclear power to national security and economic interests when carrying out licensing and related regulatory functions.

to increase new reactor licensing.

to undertake a review and revision of regulations and guidance documents in order to establish fixed deadlines in its evaluation and approval procedures and ensuring that its conclusions regarding the licensing process are delivered within 18 months, instead of following its nonbinding ""generic milestone schedules"" guidelines.

establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the Department of Defense or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely, by aiming to focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by the NRC licensing, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed by the other departments' processes.

The ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"" Executive Order is the second one to be issued by the current administration. The ""Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies"" Executive Order, issued on February 18, 2025 requires that any significant regulatory actions taken by independent regulatory agencies, including the NRC, be subject to the White House oversight. This Executive Order allows the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to set performance standards and management objectives to ensure consistency with the President's policies and priorities, while also allowing for adjustments in agency apportionments where appropriate to aid in advancement of such policies and priorities.

Tax Credits Bill

The Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") provided for an eight-year production tax credit for qualifying existing nuclear power plants and new technology neutral zero-emission production, as well as investment tax credits for new, advanced nuclear energy facilities.

On May 23, 2025, the House of Representatives passed ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" that, unless modified by the Senate, will significantly narrow the availability of several types of tax credits. The bill repeals clean energy, technology neutral electricity generation and storage tax credits provided under the IRA, such as §45Y and §48E credits for projects beginning construction 60 days after enactment as law, with projects that begin construction after such date needing to be placed in service by December 31, 2028, to receive the tax credits.

However, the bill provides beneficial treatment to nuclear project §45U (zero-emission nuclear power production) tax credit provided under the IRA by extending the credit at its full value and with full transferability through to 2031. Notably, the §48C (clean energy manufacturing and recycling, industrial decarbonization, and critical mineral projects) tax credit that was originally established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and renewed and expanded under the IRA, remains unchanged by the bill. The effect of the bill on tax credits is the subject of an extensive review published by White & Case here.

The J.H. Campbell Plant in West Olive was originally slated to shut down May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy.

But the Department of Energy (DOE) warned of heightened risk of blackouts this summer and stressed the need to address “critical grid security issues” in the Midwest, especially “ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release Friday.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” he continued.

The DOE cited a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation indicating the region serviced by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is “at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.”

The report points to the planned retirement of certain power plants as a key factor contributing to the heightened risk, as well as the “supply shortfalls” later in the summer when the sun sets earlier in the day and produces less energy.

But Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, pushed back on the order in a statement, calling it “unnecessary” and saying it “will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.”

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Scripps said.

May 8, 2025

An increasingly warming climate intensified the deluge of rain that fell on Kentucky and other states in early April, according to a new report from a multinational academic group that studies climate change’s connections to extreme weather events.

Torrential downpours inundated communities across Kentucky in early April, with some parts of Western Kentucky receiving more than a foot of rain in just four days. Some waterways including the Kentucky River in Frankfort crested at near-record highs as Kentuckians were forced to evacuate low-lying homes and businesses. Dozens of counties declared states of emergency, hundreds of roadways were closed and Gov. Andy Beshear said the storms were responsible for the deaths of seven Kentuckians.

A report from World Weather Attribution found, based on climate modeling, that the extreme rainfall across Kentucky and seven other states was about 9% more intense because of warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, that already has occurred.

Climate change increased the likelihood of the extreme rainfall — which pulled its moisture from a significantly hotter Gulf of Mexico — by about 40% compared to a cooler climate according to the report. The likelihood of such a rainfall event is still relatively rare, the report authors found, at about a 1 in 100-year event.

Bernadette Woods-Placky, a chief meteorologist at the New Jersey-based nonprofit research organization Climate Central, said in a Wednesday briefing that it’s hard to discern how climate change impacted flooding in specific waterways and communities without studying the hydrology of each area.

But she said an increase in flooding intensity, even if marginal, can be significant when talking about a “tipping point” of whether a river crests a bank or barrier that’s holding it back.

“If you hit that tipping point, then it floods over to everything. And so the littlest bit in certain areas can make a huge impact,” Woods-Placky said. “A warmer atmosphere forces more evaporation, so our atmosphere in general has more water to come down whenever there’s a trigger, wherever there’s a trigger. So that’s why we’re seeing, overall, an increase in heavy rain events.” Basil Griffin Park in Bowling Green remains inundated on April 7 after days of heavy rain.

Friederike Otto, an author of the report and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said while the methods used in the report have been peer reviewed, the study on the April rainfall has not yet been peer reviewed.

Based on modeling, the report predicts that if current climate policies across the globe remain consistent, the climate will warm by approximately 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2100; in that case, extreme rainfall events “are expected to approximately double in likelihood again” and further increase in intensity by another 7%. Earth recorded its hottest year on record in 2024, crossing a warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius that the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 aimed to avoid exceeding.

Otto, the report author at Imperial College London, said significant increases in the likelihood of such weather events from climate change could also compound the costs of recovery in communities hit repeatedly by flooding. If recovery from an extreme weather event costs billions of dollars, having it happen again could transform “what extreme weather can mean for a community.”

Those speaking Wednesday also commended the National Weather Service’s preparedness and early warnings of the incoming weather last month across multiple states, saying it was vital in protecting people and property.

Woods-Placky advocated for the national agency in light of reporting that multiple NWS offices across the country, including three offices covering almost the entirety of Kentucky, were without a chief meteorologist to lead teams of forecasters and other staff.

“They did some tremendous work, and they did save lives,” Woods-Placky said.",https://mountaincitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/climate-change-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:14:23.072500

Law 15,042/24 (the “Consumption Tax Reform”) was a milestone for the regulation of Brazil's carbon market. It established the regulated market called the Brazilian Emissions Trading System (SBCE), recognized the ""voluntary market,"" and established tax rules for the trade of carbon credits. Simultaneously, Complementary Law 214/25 regulated various aspects of the Consumption Tax Reform, providing for the introduction of new consumption taxes (IBS and CBS) in 2026.

To explain the tax treatment on the sale of carbon credits and clarify some important points, we have prepared this analysis of the tax treatment after Law 15,042/24 takes effect (from 2025) and after Complementary Law 214/25 (from 2026), with a special focus on the controversy over the levying of IBS and CBS on ""carbon credits.""

Below is a summary of the content and download the complete content at the end.

Introduction

The main innovation of Law 15,042/24 was the creation of a typical cap-and-trade system called the Brazilian Emissions Trading System (SBCE) for operators responsible for sources that emit more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually. The SBCE will be implemented in phases and is currently in Phase 1 of its regulation.

In addition to establishing a ""regulated market"" per se, Law 15.042/24 also recognized the ""voluntary market"" as the environment characterized by carbon credit transactions (a tradable, autonomous asset, representing the effective retention, reduction, or removal of one ton of CO2 emissions) voluntarily established between the parties, for the purposes of voluntary offsetting CO2 emissions.

The ""voluntary market"" for selling carbon credits is already a reality. There are several projects underway in Brazil by private and public entities, spanning a wide variety of techniques (e.g., forestry, renewable energy, biofuels) and at the center of numerous tax controversies.

Tax Landscape

There is some consensus among tax practitioners that the sale of carbon credits is not taxed by Local Services Tax (ISS) because it does not constitute the provision of services; it is not taxed by State Value-Added Tax (ICMS) because it does not constitute the sale of goods (whether tangible or intangible); and it is not taxed by the Federal Excise Tax (IPI) because it does not involve industrialization or an operation assimilated to industrialization by law.

Thus, until 2024, the taxation of carbon credits was restricted to social contributions on net revenue (PIS/COFINS) and Corporate Taxes (IRPJ/CSLL). The main controversies regarding these taxes can be summarized as follows:

For the Carbon Credit Originator opting for the Presumed Profit and cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: What would be the percentage of presumed profitability to be applied: (i) standard percentages of 8% for IRPJ and 12% for CSLL, or (ii) 32% for IRPJ and CSLL provided for ""assignment of rights"".

For the Carbon Credit Originator opting for the Real Profit and non-cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: What would be the applicable PIS/COFINS rate: (i) standard tax rate of 9.25%, or (ii) reduces tax rate of 4.65% provided for ""financial revenues"".

For the Carbon Credit Acquirer opting for Real Profit and non-cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: Whether the expenditure on the carbon credit would generate PIS/COFINS credit on inputs, and if it would be a deductible expense for corporate taxes purposes.

Repercussions and Changes

Law 15,042/24, effective as of January 2025, eliminated all of these controversies: (i) it provides for the non-levy of PIS/COFINS on revenues from the sale of carbon credits (art. 19); (ii) ensures the deductibility for IRPJ and CSLL purposes of expenditures on carbon credits (art. 18); and (iii) institutes a specific system of taxation for IRPJ and CSLL purposes (iii.1) in presumed profit, as a ""capital gain"" without applying any percentage of presumed profitability, and (iii.2) in real profit, under the ""net gains"" regime for sales on the stock exchange or ""capital gain"" for sales off the stock exchange.

Thus, as of January 2025, the sale of carbon credits will not be subject to ICMS, ISS, IPI (as they are not taxable events), and PIS/COFINS (as expressly provided for in Law 15,042/24). Only IRPJ/CSLL will be taxed, in accordance with the special taxation rule indicated above.

With the regulation of the Consumer Tax Reform by Complementary Law 214/25, the new taxes (IBS and CBS) will be levied from 2026 in a ""test phase."" From 2027 onwards, CBS will be levied, and PIS/COFINS will be abolished. From 2029, IBS will be levied, with a staggered reduction in ICMS and ISS.

The main controversy is over the incidence of IBS/CBS on ""carbon credits.""

On the one hand, it could be argued that the IBS/CBS levy is possible because Article 156-A of the Federal Constitution (included by EC N. 132/23) allows IBS and CBS to be levied on ""material or immaterial goods, including rights,"" and Complementary Law N. 214/25 made no exception for the sale of carbon credits. Thus, unlike the ISS and ICMS, the legal nature of carbon credits (tradable assets representing the retention, reduction, or removal of one ton of CO2 emissions) does not prevent IBS and CBS from being levied.

On the other hand, it should be noted that Article 146 §3 of the Federal Constitution (also included by EC N. 132/23) provides that the National Tax System must observe the principle of environmental protection. Charging the IBS/CBS - at least, without any mechanism for presumed credits or cashback - would significantly increase the tax burden purchases in the voluntary carbon credit market by non-IBS and CBS taxpayers (e.g. individuals) or taxpayers not subject to the regular IBS and CBS regime. It appears to violate the constitutional requirement to protect the environment.

What Conclusions Can We Draw?

As of January 2025, the sale of carbon credits will not be subject to any consumption taxes (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS). Income tax will only be levied on the capital gain from origination/trading, in accordance with the special rules set out in Law 15,042/24.

As of January 2027, CBS will be levied instead of PIS/COFINS. There is some controversy over the possibility of levying the tax on carbon credits because charging the CBS (and later the IBS) - at least without any mechanism for presumed credits or cashback - would significantly increase the tax burden for purchases in the voluntary carbon credit market by non-IBS and CBS taxpayers (e.g. individuals) or taxpayers not subject to the regular IBS and CBS regime.","https://www.mayerbrown.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400,quality=90,format=jpeg/-/media/images/tile-images-for-insights-and-news/tile_bucket-300x400_56.jpg?rev=a5b1d3df461c4b7b87770f128eeb7869",N,,2025-05-28 12:27:20.592150

Feds line up with Republican states in climate-investing case

U.S. federal antitrust enforcers last week expressed support for arguments wielded by Republican states accusing asset managers BlackRock, BLK Vanguard and State Street STT of conspiring through climate activism to decrease coal output.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission came in a case brought by Texas and 12 other states. Their complaint claims the firms used their substantial holdings in U.S. coal companies to discourage competition, such as through their past involvement in an investor climate group.

The entry of the federal officials raises the stakes for the case that tests how freely the three fund firms may act with the combined $27 trillion they manage for investors. Given how much criticism there has been from Republicans - many from energy-producing states - of environmental investment practices, the filing hardly comes as a surprise.

But it serves as the agencies' signal to the market that they care about the area, said Megan Gerking, a partner with law firm Morrison Foerster following the case. ""This statement of interest is a shot across the bow by the administration's new antitrust leadership against asset managers - and potentially others - regarding investments and related conduct connected to sustainability objectives,"" Gerking told me via e-mail.

The companies have pushed back, with BlackRock taking the strongest line to call the case baseless and ""based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production."" Forcing the fund firms to divest from coal companies — one outcome sought by the state plaintiffs — would harm the companies' access to capital and likely raise energy prices. The new agency support for the case undermines the goal of American energy independence, BlackRock said.

In March the companies asked a federal court to dismiss the case. A hearing is set for June 9. You can read more of our coverage by clicking here.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, was unable to independently verify those documents. But an EPA spokesperson May 27, while declining to explicitly confirm the Times report, said that the agency was ""developing a proposed rule"" on power plant emissions that would be published following an interagency review. The spokesperson said the agency would use the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in West Virginia v.

Separately, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said, ""President Trump promised to kill the Clean Power Plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now.

The EPA in March said it would ""reconsider"" the Biden-era rule. Finalized in April 2024, the rule imposed the first-ever limits on CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired and new gas-fired power plants. The rule, which effectively requires coal plants to install carbon capture technology or retire, drew praise from climate groups but sharp criticism from electric utilities, which said that carbon capture retrofits were too expensive and the resulting plant retirements would threaten grid reliability.

The EPA spokesperson said the Biden administration's rule would ""shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States"" and raise electricity prices and increase the US' ""reliance on foreign forms of energy.""

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade organization representing investor-owned utilities, told Platts in March that the EPA should adopt a ""consistent federal framework"" when revisiting the power plant rule.

The long-awaited and significant announcement was released Tuesday by union headquarters in Detroit.

Stellantis-Samsung agreement: UAW recognized in Kokomo JV

The UAW is now officially the union representative for the approximately 420 employees of the joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI, based in Kokomo, Indiana. This decision follows the clear preference expressed by the majority of workers.

This important union milestone is a direct result of the agreement reached in 2023 between the UAW and Stellantis, which followed a 44-day targeted strike. The agreement provided for a recognition system through signature collection (card-check) for the Kokomo plant, paving the way for the UAW to represent workers in this new manufacturing entity. The agreement also allows Stellantis to transfer its employees to the joint venture, which supplies essential components for the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands.

“UAW members at StarPlus have worked to ensure that battery jobs are considered good unionized jobs,” said Dave Green, UAW Region 2B director. “Workers in Indiana and throughout the region know they deserve fair wages, workplace protections and the dignity UAW members have been fighting for for 90 years. As a union, they need to know that we will support them every step of the way.”

The UAW’s recognition in Kokomo marks a point in the union’s favor in the electric vehicle battery industry, creating a stark contrast to the difficulties encountered in Kentucky.

UAW, success in Kokomo, obstacles in Kentucky

Production in Kokomo began earlier this year. Stellantis had announced plans in 2022 to build a first battery plant in the city, where it already produces powertrains and transmissions. The planned investment was at least $2.5 billion for a 33-gigawatt-hour plant, with the creation of 1,400 jobs. In 2023, the company expressed its intention to build a second $3.2 billion, 34-gigawatt-hour plant, scheduled to open in 2027, adding another 1,400 jobs.

Jodi Tinson, spokesperson for Stellantis, confirmed the UAW’s recognition, “Employees at the StarPlus Energy plant in Kokomo, Indiana, hired by Stellantis, have completed verification of union cards, demonstrating majority support for representation by the United Auto Workers (UAW).” He added, “In accordance with established procedures, the UAW was recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.”

While StarPlus Energy in Kokomo, a joint venture of Stellantis, recognized the United Auto Workers (UAW) union representation through a card check, the situation is quite different at BlueOval SK in Glendale, Kentucky. Here, Ford Motor Co. has rejected a similar system for electric vehicle battery workers. In January, the UAW called for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) vote after most employees signed authorization cards in November. However, the vote is still pending, with the union alleging delaying tactics and intimidation by the company, and accusations of unsafe working conditions by some workers.

StarPlus Energy joins battery workers already represented by the UAW at Ultium Cells LLC, the joint venture between General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution Ltd. The union has already organized the plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, also through a card check system.

Uttar Pradesh is spearheading India’s green mobility revolution with more than 414,000 registered electric vehicles (EV).

This way, the state has clintched the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (183,000) and Maharashtra (179,000) in the EV sales.

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, EVs have emerged as a critical solution.

Recognising this, the Yogi Adityanath government launched the EV Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating green mobility, building a robust charging infrastructure and establishing UP as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract an investment inflow of Rs 30,000 crore and create a million jobs, setting the stage for transformative growth in the state’s EV ecosystem.

A key driver of this momentum is the widespread popularity of e-rickshaws, which now account for 85% of EV sales in UP.

These vehicles have proven highly effective for passenger and goods transport, particularly in urban areas.

UP has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further bolstering its e-mobility efforts.

In line with its focus on infrastructure, the Yogi government recently approved the installation of over 300 new EV charging stations across 16 municipal bodies.

Ayodhya, a rapidly growing tourist destination, is expected to see the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has around 33,000 EV chargers, of which 35% are fast chargers. Given the rising demand, Chief Minister Adityanath has prioritised the development of additional fast-charging stations and the upgrading of existing facilities.

Projections suggest that India could have 102 million EVs by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135, far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, as per a study by Alvarez & Marsal.

While the dominance of two and three wheelers, often charged at home, partly offsets this challenge, the UP government is moving swiftly to bridge the gap in public infra.

The state’s comprehensive EV strategy focuses on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

With these decisive steps, UP is not only driving India’s transition to green mobility but is also positioning itself as a national and global leader in the EV domain.",https://www.economypost.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EV.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 13:12:53.013285

“Ignoring the findings of the most recent DOE LNG Export Study and giving CP2 LNG the green light for construction is irresponsible and reprehensible.
A broad coalition of local residents, fishermen, economists, environmental organizations, and retired military officials submitted comments on the Department of Energy’s report, telling the Trump Administration that LNG exports, especially the CP2 LNG export facility, are not in the public interest.
Regardless, the Trump Administration has already begun greenlighting new LNG projects despite public opposition, while burying the truth about the dangers of LNG exports.","Washington, DC — Late last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave the controversial Venture Global permission to proceed with construction of its CP2 LNG export facility, despite Former FERC Chairman Phillips raising concerns about the facility’s emissions last year — which are equivalent to more than 42 million gas-powered cars or 46 coal-fired power plants.

A report from Louisiana Bucket Brigade found that Venture Global was in noncompliance for 82 days and had over 2,000 permit violations in 2023 at one of its other facilities, Calcasieu Pass LNG, where CP2 would sit adjacent to. When neighbors’ documentation is combined with filed reports, operational problems were documented on 115 out of 181 days in the first half of the year, or 63% of the time. Shrimpers and fishermen have also broadly opposed CP2, citing the likelihood that the project would wipe out their way of life.

A report by the Bullard Center for Environmental Justice found that LNG export facilities in the Gulf South add to the environmental burdens BIPOC, lower-income, and fenceline communities bear from decades of oil and gas development, where the dominating presence of this industry has created sacrifice zones. These vulnerable communities do not reap the gains from the industry operating in their neighborhoods–tax incentives go to fossil fuel companies instead of investing in education or other public services.

Moreover, approving more LNG exports raises US consumers' power bills while putting US resources in the hands of the nation’s geopolitical rivals. CP2 is already contracted with China Gas for a portion of its LNG exports, despite concerns from national security experts that companies connected to the Chinese Communist Party are leveraging US gas to build geopolitical power and make profits reselling US LNG to Europe and other markets.

Below are statements in response:

“I am deeply disheartened by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to permit the construction of the CP2 LNG export facility. This isn't just a setback for our communities; it’s a grave threat to our environment and a direct assault on the livelihoods of our fishermen and shrimpers,” said Roishetta Ozane, Founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana. “With CP1 showing 82 days of noncompliance and thousands of permit violations, it’s clear that Venture Global doesn’t care about our communities and this project won’t be any different as it also prioritizes profit over people. The emissions from CP2 will be staggering, equivalent to millions of gas-powered cars, and this will only exacerbate the climate crisis we are already facing. I will continue to fight to oppose this and other reckless decisions that jeopardize our resources and put our communities at risk for the benefit of geopolitical interests because my children’s lives depend on it, this planet depends on it.”

“CP2 isn’t just another permit—it’s an eviction notice for the ecosystems, livelihoods, and cultures that define coastal Louisiana. I’ve watched fisher families grieve as the shrimp vanish and they now get nosebleeds while they working in the waters their family has known for generations” said Alyssa Portaro, Founder of Habitat Recovery Project. “FERC’s decision ignores science, skips community input, and rewards a company already proven to violate basic protections. We’ve worked with over 150 fishermen this past year and they all see this is not development—it’s dispossession. We deserve air monitors, not more emissions; restoration, not abandonment. We will continue to work toward a future where our people, waters, and ways of life are protected—not sold off to the highest bidder.”

“Moving forward with CP2 is bad news for the American public and for our climate,” said Gillian Giannetti, senior attorney at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs. FERC once again greenlighting CP2 is throwing the health of our communities and the public interest out the window just to line the pockets of fossil-fuel-industry billionaires. NRDC remains dedicated to protecting Gulf communities affected by this dangerous proposal.”

“Granting Venture Global the permission to proceed with the construction of CP2 LNG is catastrophic for both frontline communities and the environment,” said Elizabeth Purcell, Environmental Policy Coordinator at Turtle Island Restoration Network. “Ignoring the findings of the most recent DOE LNG Export Study and giving CP2 LNG the green light for construction is irresponsible and reprehensible. This administration proves time and time again that they place corporate interests and profits over our planet and our people.”

“Organizations and impacted landowners have spoken out against the horrific impacts that CP2 would have on their communities, their health, and their livelihoods, but now, FERC has greenlit Venture Global to begin construction immediately, even during future challenges to the project,” said Nathan Matthews, Sierra Club Senior Attorney. “This shows once again that the Trump Administration is ignoring the realities of LNG exports in order to rubberstamp these projects so that Big Oil and Gas CEOs can reap the benefits while everyday Americans suffer the consequences.”

“FERC has once again shown that it does not care about people. By reauthorizing CP2, they’ve ignored basic public health standards and the lived reality of communities in Cameron. This project will be built less than a mile from people’s homes — yet there’s not even an air monitor in town. Our shrimp are disappearing, our air is poisoned, and our voices are silenced, while corporations get nearly a billion dollars a year in tax abatements to export gas — and profits — out of our communities. This isn’t regulation. It’s abandonment,” said James Hiatt, For a Better Bayou.

“FERC’s approval of CP2 is yet another attack on the frontline communities of Cameron Parish, American energy consumers and global climate stability,” said Drew Guillory, Food and Water Watch Policy Analyst. “LNG exports poison air and water, drive up domestic energy prices and spew climate emissions into the atmosphere. In a region already ravaged by industrial pollution, FERC is giving the green light to more pollution and misery, all for the sake of corporate profits”

“This decision is both unlawful and morally indefensible,” said Megan Gibson, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “FERC is once again rubber-stamping fossil fuel infrastructure that will permanently displace fishermen, effectively eradicate their way of life, bulldoze fragile coastal wetlands, and lock in decades of pollution for export. There is no public benefit here—only private gain for a company aiming to export U.S. gas overseas.”

""Approving Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility dismisses the well-documented risks LNG projects pose to public health, air quality, and local economies while deepening the climate crisis.” said Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice. “Gulf Coast communities have long battled fossil fuel pollution, enduring disproportionate health impacts like cancer and asthma. FERC’s decision also overlooks the financial burden on families as LNG expansion drives up energy costs. We remain committed to advocating for energy policies that prioritize public interest, advance environmental justice, and protect vulnerable communities.

“FERC’s decision to greenlight CP2 is a direct assault on environmental justice. The Gulf South isn’t a sacrifice zone.” said Alexa White, Climate and Environmental Justice Policy Director at the Hip Hop Caucus. “It is home to Black, Brown, and Indigenous families who deserve clean air, safe water, and a future. This approval ignores the overwhelming evidence that LNG expansion poisons our communities, destabilizes our climate, and burdens working families with rising energy costs. Hip Hop Caucus stands with frontline leaders demanding accountability, not another pipeline of pollution.”

“Authorizing the construction of another mega-polluting fossil fuel project in the Gulf South epitomizes this administration's interest in catering to the political will of those who get rich off of harming communities with oil and gas pollution,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “The health, safety, and livelihoods of Louisianans are impacted by this decision, which worsens the injustices they face every day. This approach to energy policy is not in the public’s best interest, and will ultimately cause serious harm across the country.”

Additional Information:

The DOE’s 2024 LNG Export Study: Energy, Economic, and Environmental Assessment of U.S. LNG Exports found that:

There are enough LNG exports already approved to meet global demand for decades to come;

Unfettered exports of LNG will increase wholesale domestic natural gas prices by over 30%;

LNG facilities tend to be concentrated in communities overburdened with petrochemical pollution;

Increasing LNG exports threatens our ability to meet our global commitment of limiting warming to 1.5ºC and would displace more renewables than coal globally.

A broad coalition of local residents, fishermen, economists, environmental organizations, and retired military officials submitted comments on the Department of Energy’s report, telling the Trump Administration that LNG exports, especially the CP2 LNG export facility, are not in the public interest. Regardless, the Trump Administration has already begun greenlighting new LNG projects despite public opposition, while burying the truth about the dangers of LNG exports.

LNG exports in the United States have rapidly increased in recent years, harming public health, devastating the environment, raising prices for families, and threatening national security. Peer-reviewed research indicates that the climate impact of LNG is even greater than coal. Nevertheless, the oil and gas industry is seeking to build on its record profits by rapidly increasing the US’s LNG export capacity – even as demand drops in Europe and security concerns rise around exports via China.

Coal and natural gas are more than just economic inputs in Southwest Virginia.","In Southwest Virginia, we've long known the value of what's beneath our feet. For generations, coal has powered the region's economy, sustained communities, and fueled American industry. Now, it offers America a practical example of how energy communities can lead the way in innovation and resilience, as Southwest Virginia offers a playbook for American energy growth. With the help of new technology and investments, the coal and natural gas industries are creating pathways for growth in our communities—such as mine methane capture—revitalizing local economies, supporting jobs, and turning waste into valuable energy assets.

Recent data underscores just how significant Southwest Virginia's energy sector is to the region's economic stability and growth. A new study from Chmura Economics & Analytics found that these industries, along with the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority (VCEDA), generated over $13.4 billion in economic output and supported more than 51,000 jobs in the region in 2024 alone. These are not temporary boosts or one-time gains. They represent a durable, ongoing contribution to the regional economy that many other areas could also benefit from. Proven success in Southwest Virginia can be the catalyst for national progress when backed by smart policy.

One of the most promising drivers of this growth is through coal mine methane capture, a fast-expanding segment of Virginia's energy production. Historically treated as waste of which the vast majority is simply vented into the atmosphere, methane from coal mines is now being captured, refined, and integrated into existing natural gas infrastructure. In 2024, coal mine methane projects and the natural gas industry contributed to $481.7 million in economic impact and supported over 1,100 jobs in Southwest Virginia. These projects exemplify the kind of practical, investment-ready solutions that deliver on core policy goals: strengthening Virginia's economy, creating jobs, and supporting domestic energy production.

This opportunity goes well beyond Southwest Virginia. Coal mining communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, and Alabama can replicate this model. The geography is already there; so are the people, the pipelines, and the local knowledge built over generations. These are not communities that need to start from scratch. They need a level playing field and policy support to scale a proven model. By investing in what's already working, Congress can help accelerate economic revitalization in places that have long been asked to wait for future solutions.

But that growth won't happen automatically. Coal mine methane projects are currently excluded from the federal Section 45Q tax credit, even though other emission-reduction technologies—such as carbon capture and storage (CCS)—are eligible. Meanwhile, other waste-derived fuels such as renewable natural gas (RNG) benefit from existing incentives, including the Renewable Fuel Standard program and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), while coal communities and coal mine methane are left behind. The Methane Reduction and Economic Growth Act, recently reintroduced in Congress, would fix this by including coal mine methane in 45Q. By giving coal mine methane projects access to the same credit structure as other technologies, Congress can attract investment, reduce barriers, and ensure rural energy workers aren't left behind.

Coal and natural gas are more than just economic inputs in Southwest Virginia. They serve as the backbone of local life, powering homes, fueling industries, and supporting everything from supply chains to small businesses. In many counties, energy production drives tax revenue, funds public services, and provides stable employment. These industries contribute far more than raw output; they sustain communities and strengthen America's overall energy position.

At a time when global energy supplies remain fragile and domestic demand is rising, the U.S. can't afford to overlook proven opportunities like coal mine methane capture. This is about energy independence, economic security, and getting the most out of what we've already built. With clear policy support, companies are ready to invest, and workers are ready to lead.

Let's turn overlooked energy into undeniable strength for communities nationwide, starting now.

30%: Antonio Filosa Has To Get Stellantis Ready For What's Next

Stellantis Brands

Photo by: Stellantis

Stellantis is kind of a preposterous car company, when you really think about it. It's the product of a merger between Fiat Chrysler (itself a merger, naturally) and France's PSA Group, so it counts under its umbrella everything from Fiat and Jeep to Citroën and Opel. This was all supposed to give Stellantis unprecedented scale to meet the future of carmaking, which will be powered by batteries and software instead of engines and conventional hardware.

It's fair to say things haven't exactly gone that way. Under the previous CEO Carlos Tavares (who was as much the architect of Stellantis as anyone) the company's multi-national collection of brands faced issues with profitability, sales, pricing, competing on technology, coming in late to electrification and cooperating with one another. Then you add in the usual set of auto industry problems these days, including declining sales in China, high labor costs and market declines in Europe, tariffs, layoffs, labor unrest, angry dealers... the list goes on and on.

By the time Tavares left, everybody wanted him gone. The dealers were mad, the unions were mad, the investors were mad, and the customers were mad at the outrageous prices they were paying for the cars. It's hard to parse what's actually gone well at Stellantis, if we're being brutally honest—even if some individual brands have done better than others.

Antonio Filosa - Stellantis

Filosa is tasked with fixing that. He's an Italian native who started with the Fiat Group in 1999 and had an expansive career across Latin America, then North America, and most recently heading up the entire Jeep brand and serving as Chief Operating Officer for the Americas. ""Since his appointment, he has initiated the strengthening of the U.S. operations, including by significantly reducing excessive dealer inventory, reorganizing the leadership team, driving the process of introducing new products and powertrains, and increasing dialogue with dealers, unions and suppliers,"" Stellantis officials said in a statement.

Besides repairing many fractured relationships, Filosa will need to better transition Stellantis into an electrified and software-powered car company in many of its markets—a tall order when many of its contingents seem eager to fall back on internal combustion.

And he may be tasked with killing off some brands, which is probably overdue.

60%: May New Car Sales May Be Milder, Just Like EV Growth

New car sales, including EVs, have been relatively strong this year despite still-high interest rates. But a new report from S&P Global Mobility says that May's numbers are expected to be cooler as customers brace for the impact of tariffs.

""Given the swirling tariff, consumer and auto inventory conditions, the expected May 2025 auto sales result will likely be the last period this year to post positive growth in year-ago and month-prior comparisons,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""Shifting tariff policies have automakers scrambling to produce vehicles while they can, but uncertainty abounds in the immediate term and upcoming monthly sales levels are expected to decelerate further.""

S&P reports that the same is unfortunately true for the EV field in America. While EV tax credits remain in effect for now, and likely will for several more months, it's clear that they're in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and Congress.

""BEV share fell to an estimated 7.0% in both March and April, and while some of the lower share could be attributed to strong non-BEV demand, BEV growth is moderating,"" the report said. ""May BEV share is expected to reach a similar 6.8% share, reflective of the uneasiness as automakers, dealers and consumers continue to digest potential changes to BEV incentives.""

If you are shopping for a new EV, now is the time to do it before the credits go away and tariffs really start to hit.

90%: GM Replaces Electric Motor Plan For More V8s

GM may be playing the long game on EVs and batteries, but for the foreseeable future, it still makes its money with big, gas-powered trucks. And EV sales haven't begun to eclipse the sales of gas cars at the pace once predicted by the entire industry.

Hence, a GM plant in Buffalo once destined for electric motors is now going to make new V8 engines instead. From the Wall Street Journal:

The company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant and makes Tonawanda its second propulsion plant to produce the sixth generation of V8 engines.

The engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs, use new combustion and thermal management innovations to improve performance while reducing emissions, the company said.

The investment includes new machinery, equipment, tools and facility renovations, and builds on GM’s work to boost its manufacturing facilities in recent years, including a half-billion-dollar investment in its Flint engine plant in 2023, the company said.

GM still says it sees the future as all-electric—eventually. But getting there is the tricky part.

100%: How Would You Turn Stellantis Around?

At least here in America, it's often disappointing to see Stellantis' brands so behind the curve on electrification. Sure, it's had success with hybrid Jeeps and the like, but its pure EV game leaves a lot to be desired so far. Then again, the company seems to have more immediate, existential issues it must face before it can tackle the future.

While the dominance of two- and three-wheelers, often charged at home, partly offsets this challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government is moving swiftly to bridge the gap in public infrastructure.
The state’s comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) strategy focuses on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations, and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

Uttar Pradesh now leads the country in electric vehicle adoption, with over 4.14 lakh EVs registered—outpacing Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh)

Lucknow, May 28: Under the dynamic leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh is spearheading India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution. With more than 4.14 lakh electric vehicles registered, the state has taken the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh).

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a critical solution. Recognizing this, the Yogi government launched the Electric Vehicle Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, building a robust charging infrastructure, and establishing Uttar Pradesh as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract an investment inflow of ₹30,000 crore and create 10 lakh jobs, setting the stage for transformative growth in the state’s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.

A key driver of this momentum is the widespread popularity of e-rickshaws, which now account for 85% of electric vehicle (EV) sales in the state. These vehicles have proven highly effective for passenger and goods transport, particularly in urban areas.

Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further bolstering its e-mobility efforts.

In line with its focus on infrastructure, the Yogi government has recently approved the installation of over 300 new electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across 16 municipal bodies. Ayodhya, a rapidly growing tourist destination, is expected to see the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has around 33,000 EV chargers, of which 35% are fast chargers. Given the rising demand, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has prioritised the development of additional fast-charging stations and the upgrading of existing facilities.

Projections suggest that India could have 102 million electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135, far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, as per a study by Alvarez & Marsal. While the dominance of two- and three-wheelers, often charged at home, partly offsets this challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government is moving swiftly to bridge the gap in public infrastructure.

The state’s comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) strategy focuses on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations, and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

With these decisive steps, Uttar Pradesh is not only driving India’s transition to green mobility but is also positioning itself as a national and global leader in the electric vehicle (EV) sector.",https://i0.wp.com/www.morningkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-28T192131.396-jpg.webp,N,,2025-05-28 14:13:47.624267

The bill increases oil and gas leasing, calling for more lease sales in the Gulf of America (Mexico) and reviving leasing in Alaska, which will reverse policies put in place by former President Biden. It also cuts clean energy tax credits. The bill now moves to the Senate.

GOM Lease Sales

The House bill requires at least 30 lease sales in the U.S. Gulf of America (Mexico) over the next 15 years, with the first to be held August 15. The lease sales would rotate between August and March through 2040. Each Gulf lease sale would have to offer at least 80 million acres, if that much unleased acreage is available. The bill directs the Interior Department to “immediately resume” quarterly onshore lease sales, in contrast to Biden’s policy that curbed oil and gas drilling shortly after he took office in 2021. The 30 lease sales represent a significant shift from the policies of the Biden administration, which implemented an offshore leasing program featuring only three lease sales in five years. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum is already working on a revamped offshore oil and gas lease plan that will add more lease sales to the current schedule produced by the Biden administration.

The bill also modifies the GOM Energy Security Act (GOMESA), which outlines how offshore oil and gas revenue is distributed to Gulf Coast states, raising the distribution cap from $500 million to $650 million from 2026 to 2034 before lowering the cap back to $500 million.

Lease Sales in Alaska

The House bill orders the Interior Department to hold at four lease sales in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and restores oil and gas leases that were canceled by the Biden administration. It also orders Interior to resume the oil and gas program in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and requires at least six lease sales in the next decade in Alaska’s Cook Inlet, with the first required by March 2026.

“Clean” Energy Credits

The bill rolls back tax credits for solar and wind, along with clean hydrogen production, and “clean” vehicles, among other measures.

Specifically, the House bill requires projects to “commence construction” within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to qualify for tax credits and be placed in service by the end of 2028. According to “clean” energy developers, the bill weakens the “clean” electricity investment and production tax credits in a way that could make them largely unusable. Because the credits mostly help wind and solar — technologies that have been around for decades, receiving massive subsidies during that time — they should be considered mature and no longer need credits. In fact, driven by subsidies, wind and solar have overtaken coal in their combined share of the generating market. While coal once had a 50% share, it is now reduced to 15%.

Nuclear developers are subject to a phaseout, but would be able to access investment and production tax credits when they start construction on a plant, instead of when they begin delivering energy, extending the window within which they can benefit from subsidies. Existing nuclear reactors have received an extended lifeline, as the production tax credit now phases out at the end of 2031, rather than at the start of 2029, as proposed under the previous plan. For nuclear energy, companies are allowed to transfer tax credits to a buyer in exchange for cash, an option known as transferability.

The bill also rescinds unallocated funds from the IRA. It also repeals funding for a methane emissions reduction program under the Clean Air Act. The carbon capture tax credits that were increased through the IRA, known as 45Q credits, were left intact.

Other Provisions

The bill sets a $1 million fee for gas companies that apply to the Department of Energy to import or export liquefied natural gas and allows those applicants to pay an additional $10 million to expedite their federal regulatory reviews.

The bill also provides $1.32 billion to the Energy Department to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and repeals a provision that would have forced the agency to draw down specific amounts of oil from the SPR in 2026 and 2027. President Biden substantially drew down the emergency oil reserve to keep oil and gasoline prices low during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

Tax credits for electric vehicles remain largely the same as in previous drafts, as they were approved by the Ways and Means Committee.

(“Fluence”) (Nasdaq: FLNC), a global market leader delivering intelligent energy storage systems, operational services, and asset optimization software, welcomed U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) to the Utah-based manufacturing facility that is producing Fluence’s battery modules. The visit spotlighted Fluence’s growing investment in U.S.-based manufacturing and its leadership in building a resilient domestic supply chain for battery energy storage solutions that has been accelerated by the availability of federal tax credits that directly support manufacturing in the United States.

Senator Curtis toured the U.S. domestic manufacturing facility and joined Fluence executives for a press conference and discussion centered on the economic and strategic benefits of U.S. domestic energy production and manufacturing.

“As energy demand continues to grow, we need an all-of-the-above approach that supports Utahns and provides the long-term certainty businesses need to invest and expand,” said Senator Curtis. “In Utah, we’ve seen firsthand how smart policies—like energy tax credits—can drive innovation, strengthen our economy, and create real opportunity. I was pleased to visit Fluence’s energy storage operations at the manufacturing facility in Tooele County to see the value of these incentives in meeting both our energy production and economic development goals.”

Since first announcing operations in the manufacturing facility in Utah in 2022, Fluence has quickly expanded its U.S. domestic manufacturing footprint, sourcing battery cells from a supplier in Smyrna, Tennessee—the first facility in the United States to manufacture LFP battery cells for utility-scale stationary energy storage. The company is working with manufacturing partners to ramp up the use of U.S. domestic manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Texas, further anchoring its commitment to onshoring production in the United States of every major product and component of its grid-scale battery energy storage systems for U.S. demand.

“We’re proud to host Senator Curtis and show firsthand how U.S. federal policy is translating into high-impact local manufacturing investment,” said John Zahurancik, President, Fluence Americas. “When the industry first started putting battery storage onto the grid in 2008, the core equipment was sourced from facilities in the United States. Since then, production has largely shifted overseas, even though U.S. domestic demand has skyrocketed. This facility is building the future of energy storage right here in Utah, and we’re helping to build the foundation for the United States to once again be a leader in battery manufacturing.”

Fluence’s solutions support a more flexible, reliable, and modernized power grid. By expanding access to U.S. manufacturing and sourcing U.S. domestically produced materials, Fluence is supporting the United States’ growing energy demand and energy security goals while contributing to regional economic growth.

A short video recap featuring remarks from Senator Curtis and John Zahurancik is available here.

“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said.
Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.
During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.
“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,"" he wrote.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk is criticizing the centerpiece of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, a significant fracture in a partnership that was forged during last year's campaign and was poised to reshape American politics and the federal government.

The billionaire entrepreneur, who supported Trump’s candidacy with at least $250 million and has worked for his administration as a senior adviser, said he was “disappointed” by what the president calls his “big beautiful bill.”

The legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.

“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”

His CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.

“I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,"" he said.

Trump also suggested that more changes could be made.

“We’re going to see what happens,"" he said. ""It’s got a way to go.”

Republicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.

Musk’s comments come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because ""I think I’ve done enough.”

At times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.

“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”

The White House is set to send proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE's cuts.

A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.

Musk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis.

He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.

“The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,"" Musk said in February. ""Frankly, I love him.”

Trump repaid the favor, describing Musk as ""a truly great American.” When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.

It's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.

Speaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.

However, Musk's criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was “still time to fix it.”

“The Senate version will be more aggressive,” Lee said. “It can, it must, and it will be. Or it won’t pass.”

Only two Republicans — Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.

Davidson took note of Musk’s comments on social media.

“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,"" he wrote. ""Don’t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.”

The Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.

House Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit neutral or reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.

The increase comes amid frustrations from BGE customers who have been grappling with high energy costs throughout the year.
""There's an acute misalignment between supply and demand for electricity in Maryland,"" said BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.
BGE said Tuesday that the increase was not due to the company raising its distribution rate, but an increase in the price of ""electricity itself.""
BGE customers express frustration BGE customers said the price hike is another high bill that will be added to their plates.","Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) customers in Maryland will see another significant increase in the price of electricity starting June 1.

The increase comes amid frustrations from BGE customers who have been grappling with high energy costs throughout the year.

Why will BGE's electricity costs go up on June 1?

According to BGE, the increase is the result of an unexpected spike in capacity auction prices and the Talen Energy reliability-must-run (RMR) fee.

A capacity market auction is a competitive bidding process where power companies promise to make their electricity generation available in the future.

""There's an acute misalignment between supply and demand for electricity in Maryland,"" said BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos. ""In short, we don't have enough power plants to meet the energy demand.""

Plus, Alexopulos said some plants are retiring.

""PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, has determined that those power plants have to run past their retirement date to maintain reliability of the entire electric grid in the region,"" Alexopulos said.

Last week, legislators criticized PJM Interconnection, saying that the company was responsible for an energy supply undercount at the most recent auction, causing the total cost of electricity across the PJM region to go from $2.2 billion to $14.7 billion.

BGE said Tuesday that the increase was not due to the company raising its distribution rate, but an increase in the price of ""electricity itself.""

Alexopulos said, based on historical averages for those paying for gas and electricity through BGE, you could see an estimated $40 increase in their highest bill.

""That said, if July, which is typically the hottest month where customers use the most energy, is much hotter than expected, those bills are going to be higher because you're going to be using more energy,"" Alexopulos said.

BGE customers express frustration

BGE customers said the price hike is another high bill that will be added to their plates.

""Not pleased,"" said customer Kyla Cools. ""Not thoroughly surprised either.""

""Not happy,"" Peter Bearden, another customer, said. ""Just increases the burden with the rest of inflation.""

While some have accepted the upcoming change.

""Am I going to feel bad about it?"" Jim Considine said. ""Sure, but you can't stop them.""

They said they will adjust their home practices to save a bit of cash.

""I'm paying a lot of attention to the usage metrics,"" Cools said.

""Usually, we don't put in our air conditioners until middle or late July, and I'm sure we'll do the same thing this year,"" Bearden said. ""So, we hold off as long as we can.""

What is the Talen Energy RMR fee?

The Talen Energy RMR fee refers to the fixed payments made to Talen Energy for continuing to operate its Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner power plants in Maryland, beyond their planned retirement dates.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, pays a fee of $312 per megawatt per day for the Brandon Shores plant, amounting to approximately $145 million annually, along with a $5 million performance incentive. For the H.A. Wagner plant, PJM pays a fee of $137 per megawatt per day, which totals about $35 million per year, plus a $2.5 million performance incentive.

The details are outlined in a settlement agreement reached in January 2025.

Energy-saving tips for the summer

BGE said there are several things you can do to lower your bill:

Schedule service for your HVAC system to keep it operating efficiently.

Lower your water heater temperature and set it to 120 degrees.

Raise your thermostat to a level that is still safe and comfortable.

Monitor your energy usage in your BGE My Account or in the BGE mobile app.

Maryland struggles with ongoing energy rate increases

BGE raised rates on January 1, increasing the average residential gas bill by 9% and the electric bill by 7%. Some customers saw even larger jumps, with winter bills climbing by more than $200.

The utility cited several reasons for the hikes, including higher distribution costs regulated by the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC), a 30% rise in natural gas prices over the past year, and increased spending on energy efficiency programs mandated by the state.

BGE also pointed to major investments in gas infrastructure upgrades.

Baltimore City Council President Zeke Cohen has raised questions about the company's long-term plans.

Earlier this month, Cohen called for transparency around BGE's proposed multi-year rate increases for 2026.

In 2023, the PSC approved BGE's multi-year delivery rate increases, enabling the company to raise rates by approximately $408 million over three years for both gas and electric services.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/25/bdd0ec2b-9a5f-4b66-943f-8e5df80f3121/thumbnail/1200x630/b6fe4b563a614332b5bf7a6813470756/bge-rates.jpg?v=f5922acb8cfbf6d7fe1f82314e5e9885,N,,2025-05-28 13:13:17.743384

The shopping center landlord has already been informed of the violation, according to comments made by Charmaine Kettler-Schmult, director of planning and community development for Farmington Hills, Michigan to CDB. But she admitted to reporters that the enforcement process “takes time.”

The report notes Tesla recently opened a brand new showroom close to the Hunter’s Square shopping center in West Bloomfield, which could be the source of the idled Cybertrucks. Crain’s Detroit Business reached out to both the registered owner of that site and the landlord of Hunter’s Square, which is due to get a major overhaul, but neither responded.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk once bragged of having 1 million reservations for the Cybertruck, but the much-delayed EV has failed to live up to sales expectations since its official debut in late 2023. Only 40,000 were sold last year, well short of the 250,000 Tesla predicted, according to Forbes. And recently the Cybertruck was outperformed by its more conventional-looking Ford F-150 Lightning rival.

Tesla has made moves to open up the Cybetruck’s appeal, however. In April it finally unveiled a single-motor, rear-wheel drive, entry-level model for $69,990 and buyers of other grades have been offered discounts, lease deals and free supercharging.

Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here.
Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.
That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.” Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state.","After trying and failing to carve out more exceptions to Wyoming’s longstanding ban against storing radioactive nuclear power plant waste earlier this year, lawmakers will take another swing at gaining support for the idea.

They’re particularly focused on clearing the way for Radiant Industries, which proposes manufacturing microreactors and “temporarily” storing their spent, radioactive fuel at a site near the towns of Casper and Bar Nunn.

After Senate File 186, “??Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” went down in flames during this year’s legislative session, lawmakers on the joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee called in experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to answer questions about evolving safeguards and the industry’s track record.

In nearly 40 years of “dry cask” storage in the United States, “we have had zero release of radiation or radioactive material to the environment,” Idaho National Laboratory Used Fuel Management Department Manager Daniel Thomas told lawmakers last week in Casper.

“Similarly, in transportation, we have moved [spent nuclear] fuel for several million miles on rail, on road, by boat, with zero accidents,” Thomas testified.

Those assurances, along with evolving federal safeguards, rang true for Lander resident William Almas, who offered his perspectives to the committee via Zoom.

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation. But that’s not the point, he noted. Such expert testimony won’t be, and it shouldn’t be, enough to convince others in Wyoming.

Health and safety concerns are valid, Almas said, particularly in a state that doesn’t yet host nuclear waste. All the pamphlets, slide decks and expert testimony in the world don’t matter a lick, Almas suggested, unless state leaders initiate a long conversation with residents that, ideally, is moderated by a “third party.”

“A key factor contributing to the lack of success of these projects is the failure of the community to reach consensus on the safety and the value of the projects,” Almas told the panel. “The facts must be clearly presented and discussed by an impartial third party, moving both the proponents and opposition in a forum for discussion.”

Lawmakers on the panel nodded and noted the suggestion. The panel directed the Legislative Service Office to draft another version of SF 186 for further consideration when it meets again in July.

Radioactive hurdles

After decades of public opposition, Wyoming lawmakers tweaked statutes in 2022 to allow for storage of spent nuclear fuel — so long as it is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state.

The move was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer. The “advanced” nuclear reactor will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2030, will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

Wyoming’s legal pathway for TerraPower to store its spent fuel on site is contingent upon the company receiving approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will oversee the plant’s operation and radioactive waste storage.

While SF 186 would have made another exemption to the state’s ban by allowing microreactor manufacturers such as Radiant to store spent fuel, House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have opened the door to commercial operations to potentially take the waste from nuclear power plants from all over the country. Both bills failed this year. Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here. State statute prohibits a commercial high-level radioactive waste facility, whether it’s spent fuel from a power plant from another state or a microreactor built in the state, as Radiant proposes, unless the federal government establishes a permanent repository.

That’s not likely to happen anytime soon, according to federal officials. It will take an act of Congress to resume efforts to establish one at Yucca Mountain, or anywhere else, according to Idaho National Laboratory’s Thomas, who worked for more than a decade on the Yucca Mountain project.

“Yucca Mountain has been defunded and is not being pursued,” Thomas said. If Congress were to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to resume the work, he added, “I would say that we are probably four or more decades off.”

That leaves Wyoming to consider whether to make another exception to its nuclear waste storage ban.

What’s at stake

The Wyoming Energy Authority and Wyoming Business Council are eagerly pursuing companies interested in reinvigorating the state’s uranium mines, hoping to launch a mining-to-reactor industry that becomes an integral piece of domestic energy security.

Rare Element Resources’ Bear Lodge Project in northeast Wyoming, to mine uranium ore and refine it, is well underway. That project has sparked interest among others on the nuclear fuel supply side to join the effort in the Equality State.

Having a nearby supply of refined uranium ore gives a leg up to companies like Radiant and BWXT Advanced Technologies that want to build portable microreactors here and deploy them to industrial customers throughout the nation and world, according to the companies. BWXT, with a matching grant from the state, is already building a nuclear reactor component supply chain among existing fabrication shops here. Though BWXT is still exploring whether to set up an actual microreactor manufacturing shop in Wyoming, Radiant proposes a manufacturing facility just outside of Bar Nunn. Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.

“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance,” Radiant Director of Operations Matt Wilson told lawmakers. “But when you look at other countries — Russia, China — they are well ahead of us when it comes to projects not just in the pipeline, but coming on every year. And that’s not just on the advanced reactor side. That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.”

Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state. More public education and engagement are needed, he said, as well as details from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about containment measures should there be an “episode” at a nuclear facility.

“I would recommend that we reach out and ask for testimony so that we can have all sides of a picture before we make decisions on things,” Knapp said.

Consequently, basic information about the Bank’s climate finance, including which activities get financed and how much climate finance is delivered in each country, remains unknown.
The second report estimated that, on average, actual climate finance expenditures could differ from budgeted climate finance expenditures by between 26-43%, between 2017 and 2023.
By implementing this important change, the World Bank effectively becomes a leader on transparency of climate finance reporting not only among all Multilateral Development Banks but also bilateral climate finance contributors.","In the current climate crisis and in the face of massive challenges, every positive development in the climate fight is worth celebrating. On this front Oxfam welcomes recent positive news from the World Bank. The Bank has amended its climate finance assessment and reporting methods, reflecting Oxfam's recommendations. And these changes represent an important precedent and promise greater clarity on climate finance allocation and spending, enhancing the ability of researchers and affected communities to obtain accurate information for monitoring and accountability. Let's remember that the Bank is the largest single conduit of climate finance – providing US$ 42.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2024.

What was missing from the Bank’s climate finance reporting?

To understand the problems with the Bank’s climate finance reporting, it's essential to grasp how the Bank estimates its climate finance. As each project the Bank will finance is approved by its board, staff at the Bank assess all the activities in the project (using an agreed upon methodology) to calculate which activities qualify as “climate finance”. The total value of these activities across the annual portfolio constitutes the Bank's annual climate finance.

Oxfam identified two primary issues with this approach:

Partial assessment: Climate finance is estimated when a project is approved, not when it is completed. Projects often change during implementation, but, historically, the Bank did not reassess climate finance based on actual expenditures. This means the Bank’s climate finance claims reflect intended financing (in Bank parlance this is termed ex-ante reporting), not actual financing (which would be termed ex-post reporting). Consequently, basic information about the Bank’s climate finance, including which activities get financed and how much climate finance is delivered in each country, remains unknown.

Lack of granularity of Reporting: Each World Bank project is comprised of components, which are comprised of sub-components, which are themselves comprised of activities. Historically, the Bank has only systematically provided information on their climate finance at the project level – broken down by mitigation and adaptation finance. This is a problem because it is at the level of sub-components and the activity that issues of qualifying for climate finance are determined. The Bank reports climate finance at the project level, not at the activity level where climate qualification is determined. This makes public oversight of project implementation and tracking of claimed climate finance on the ground impossible. Effectively, under this approach, the public had no choice but to accept the Bank’s estimates at face value.

Oxfam’s Research and Advocacy

To highlight these issues, Oxfam produced two research reports estimating the potential inaccuracies in the Bank’s climate finance claims due to the lack of granularity in the Bank's reporting and timing of their assessment. The first report examined data from FY20 and found that the Bank’s climate finance claims could be off by as much as $7 billion or 40% of the Bank’s claimed climate finance for that year. The second report estimated that, on average, actual climate finance expenditures could differ from budgeted climate finance expenditures by between 26-43%, between 2017 and 2023. This difference amounts to between $24.28 – $41.31 billion in climate finance, which is effectively untracked in terms of its impact on climate. This does not mean any money is missing or has been misused; rather, we don’t know for sure whether it was spent on activities that qualify as climate finance. These two Oxfam reports served to quantify the inadequacies of the Bank’s climate finance reporting and raise awareness of the issue. The scale of these numbers made clear that these reporting issues were too large to ignore, which opened a space for Oxfam to discuss solutions with the Bank's climate unit and top decision-makers.

The Bank’s Response

Partly in response to Oxfam’s advocacy, the Bank announced significant changes:

Improved granular reporting: For all projects with climate finance approved after April 1st, 2025, the Bank will publish their calculations and justifications for climate finance at the sub-component level.

Reporting at the end of the project: For projects closing after July 1st, 2025, the Bank will analyze and report ex-post assessments of climate finance, detailing the climate qualifying activities actually supported after project completion.

These steps are important and commendable, especially given the Bank’s existing data management challenges. The swift implementation of ex-post reporting is particularly important not only for accountability reasons but critically to move towards outcome and impact reporting and ensure the quality of climate actions financed with limited climate resources. By implementing this important change, the World Bank effectively becomes a leader on transparency of climate finance reporting not only among all Multilateral Development Banks but also bilateral climate finance contributors.

Remaining Challenges

Despite these improvements, challenges persist. An important remaining issue relates to data storage and access. Most data are stored in project-associated PDFs, making large-scale analysis difficult. To address this the Bank should collect all this new climate finance data into a central climate finance database that is publicly available, easy to search and in a machine-readable format that facilitates the use of the data. Additionally, while reporting at the sub-component level is a positive step, the implementation details will determine whether the public can fully understand and assess climate finance expenditures. For this, the Bank should make additional efforts to also publish climate finance data at the activity level for each project – a level of granularity that allows for an independent audit of both the application of the method and an on-the-ground assessment of projects.

Encouragement for Future Actions

Oxfam commends the Bank’s willingness to continue improving its climate finance reporting and hopes that the Bank's leadership sets a precedent that other Multilateral Development Banks and bilateral climate financiers will follow. We urge other actors working on climate finance issues to use this new data to enhance accountability and ensure effective climate action, particularly in less industrialized countries with significant needs and minimal responsibility for the climate crisis.",https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/images/Oxfam_InuruID_.width-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:11.992311

Statesman News Service | Lucknow |

Uttar Pradesh is at the forefront of India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution. With over 4.14 lakh EVs registered, the state has claimed the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh).

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, electric vehicles have emerged as a key solution. Recognizing this, the Uttar Pradesh government launched the Electric Vehicle Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, building robust charging infrastructure, and positioning the state as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract ₹30,000 crore in investments and create 10 lakh jobs, laying the foundation for transformative growth in the state’s EV ecosystem.

Officials stated on Wednesday that a key driver behind this momentum is the widespread use of e-rickshaws, which now account for nearly 85 per cent of EV sales in the state. These vehicles have proven especially effective for transporting passengers and goods in urban areas.

Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further strengthening its e-mobility initiatives.

As part of its infrastructure focus, the Yogi Adityanath-led government has approved the installation of over 300 new EV charging stations across 16 municipal bodies. Ayodhya, a rapidly growing pilgrimage and tourist destination, is expected to receive the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has approximately 33,000 EV charging stations, 35% of which are fast chargers. Projections suggest that India could have 102 million EVs on the road by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135—far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, according to a study by Alvarez & Marsal.

While the dominance of two- and three-wheelers, typically charged at home, somewhat mitigates this challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government is working swiftly to improve public charging infrastructure.

The state’s comprehensive EV strategy is built on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations, and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

With these decisive initiatives, Uttar Pradesh is not only steering India’s transition to green mobility but also positioning itself as a national and global leader in the electric vehicle sector.

In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana’s Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance” of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The law presumes “that air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,” the complaint states.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia “Cindy” Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.

But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.

On May 22, Robertson’s group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.

When neighbors asked where the flags went, “I’d tell them, ‘The state of Louisiana says we can’t tell y’all that stuff,’ ” Robertson said.

While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission said it was intended to censor them with “onerous restrictions” and violates their free-speech rights, according to the lawsuit.

Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur’s pollution using high-quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group’s social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.

Federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, but “fence-line” communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.

The Biden administration’s EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the “fence-line” with industrial plants that emit pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups, saying they lack confidence in the data the state does provide, embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.

“These programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,” the lawsuit stated.

In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana’s Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance” of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“You can’t talk about air quality unless you’re using the equipment that they want you to use,” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide “perfectly adequate results … to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they’re breathing is safe.”

Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.

“We’re a small nonprofit, we couldn’t afford to pay one day’s worth of that,” Robertson said. “And the way the law is written, it’s so ambiguous, you don’t really know what you can and can’t do.”

There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.

“The purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,” said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

“I’m not sure how regulating community air-monitoring programs ‘violates their constitutional rights’,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.

Industry groups are excluded from the law’s requirements, the lawsuit notes.

The law presumes “that air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,” the complaint states.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency refused to comment, citing pending litigation.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s credibility as a professional, independent regulator is also a major selling point for U.S. nuclear vendors seeking to win overseas contracts.","On May 23, President Trump signed four executive orders designed to dramatically expand and accelerate U.S. development and construction of nuclear power plants, with emphasis on advanced reactors.

The stated rationale for the administration’s action is a combination of a domestic energy emergency and a desire to win the geopolitical competition against China and Russia. However, if implemented as written, these orders could undermine the very objective they intend to promote.

The new orders assert that the failure of the U.S. to develop the nuclear energy sector in recent decades is primarily attributable to a myopic and misguided approach to nuclear regulation by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Under the Atomic Energy Act, the commission licenses the design, construction and operation of domestic nuclear and radiological facilities, including commercial nuclear power plants.

The orders lay out a series of radical steps to scale back, reorient and even bypass the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by having the Departments of Energy or Defense license non-commercial reactors to be built on their federal sites. In total, they aim to achieve rapid development of new nuclear designs and expedited construction of advanced nuclear power plants.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also ordered to effect a “wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance” within nine months.

The desire to revamp the U.S. nuclear industrial base, encourage and support new nuclear power plant construction, and streamline Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing is welcome.

However, it is neither new nor specific to the Trump administration. Under the ADVANCE Act passed by Congress in 2024, the commission had already begun to adapt its licensing processes for new reactor designs and recruit staff to do this work.

Three flawed premises guide the new executive orders. First, they see the future of nuclear energy as fundamentally similar to that of other energy sources — whereby innovation in design and fast deployment are seen as inherent net positives, and bugs, if any, can be fixed later.

The orders downplay or ignore the special magnitude of nuclear risks, the series of traumatic accidents suffered by leading nuclear power nations and the unique environmental and multi-generational footprint of nuclear waste and spent fuel.

Second, nuclear regulation is mostly viewed as unduly burdensome, expensive, time-consuming and an outright drag on efficiency.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is explicitly blamed for “throttling nuclear power development” in the U.S. In this regard, the orders fail to recognize a central purpose of regulation: to build and maintain trust in nuclear energy.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not presented the key obstacle to nuclear development in the U.S. And it is the key instrument to earn and keep trust in nuclear energy both nationally and internationally.

Third, the executive orders grossly exaggerate the delays to new deployment legitimately attributable to excessive nuclear regulation. They underestimate the addition of time to market due to limitations on workforce availability, supply chain, financing, specialty fuels and community buy-in.

What Americans need is confidence that any nuclear power plant built and operated in the U.S. is safe, secure and ultimately beneficial to American and host community prosperity.

However, the net result of these executive orders, coupled with the additional impact of other administration actions to reform governmental regulatory processes to align with White House policies, is to risk public trust in nuclear energy.

Downscaling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s staff, curtailing its political independence, compromising its technical integrity, scaling back its community engagement role or avoiding the commission outright introduces more uncertainty than inspires confidence in a nuclear renaissance.

It would shatter the commission’s credibility, nationwide and worldwide, to lower the risk standards it has been credibly using for years to minimize adverse radiation effects from nuclear power plants.

Furthermore, the orders are bound to expedite the brain drain from the agency, whose credibility, speed and efficiency are all dependent on a quality workforce that firmly believes in its mission and inspires all others with its professionalism.

They will reduce confidence in further extending the lives of aging nuclear power plants —many of which have been operating for 60 years or more — or in restarting mothballed plants.

And they could unnecessarily increase public wariness that new nuclear designs will not be subjected to a rigorous and transparent review before their performance can be fully demonstrated and tested.

The public reactions to the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima underscore how critical trust is to sustaining public support for nuclear power.

Here, the global setback to the credibility of the Federal Aviation Agency as a U.S. aerospace licensing authority is a poignant reminder, when it emerged after deadly crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max, that the agency had delegated some of its licensing process to the company.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s credibility as a professional, independent regulator is also a major selling point for U.S. nuclear vendors seeking to win overseas contracts.

At a time when the U.S. nuclear industry is trying to achieve economies of scale to bolster its competitiveness against Russian and Chinese firms (who can offer better financing and other perks), the commission’s reputation as the gold standard in nuclear regulation is one of the few comparative American advantages.

Yes, Nuclear Regulatory Commission operations should be more efficient. The effort to make them so is already well underway and could be further encouraged.

But now — just as nuclear power nears a new dawn — is the worst possible time to damage the commission’s capacity to credibly assess and faithfully, independently and publicly report its evaluations and licensing considerations and decisions.

A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists published Tuesday found River Bend was the most problematic nuclear plant in the U.S., when measuring regulatory violations.","Elected officials homed in Tuesday on the timeline of events that led to an abrupt order of forced blackouts on Sunday in Louisiana, prompting Entergy and Cleco to cut the lights to 100,000 residents in the New Orleans area amid hot, late-spring temperatures.

Regulators had previously pinned the outages, in part, on the unexpected shutdown of River Bend, a nuclear plant north of Baton Rouge. But Entergy and federal officials said Tuesday that River Bend was shut down because of a leak on May 21. That left the grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, with several days to plan for the lower supply of electricity.

The timing has raised more questions about why Louisiana was forced into a “load shed” event that caused widespread outages well before peak summer demand for electricity.

Officials are asking Entergy and MISO officials to answer questions publicly about what happened next Tuesday at a City Council meeting and at a Public Service Commission hearing next month, in a bid to figure out how the looming power deficit was not caught earlier. Entergy is also expected to face questions about its long-standing lack of transmission in south Louisiana that has created “load pockets” where it’s difficult to import power.

The River Bend nuclear plant shut down May 21 after operators noticed a leak, which they identified two days later as the result of a faulty valve in the reactor’s cooling system, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Entergy fixed the valve over the weekend before bringing the plant back online Monday.

The plant did not unexpectedly trip offline over the weekend, as has been previously reported, said Victor Dricks, spokesperson for the NRC.

But the Mid-Continent System Operator, a nonprofit that operates the electric grid across a wide swath of the U.S., did not give Entergy or Cleco advance warning that power demand was set to outstrip supply. A New Orleans City Council member said Tuesday that Entergy reported getting only three minutes notice Sunday before being forced to “shed load,” or proactively turn off the lights for tens of thousands of people to avoid catastrophic damage to the electric grid.

If regulators and Entergy had known about the looming power deficit, regulators and advocates say they could have taken steps to prevent forced blackouts. Some industrial plants have contracts that require them to ramp down power during such emergencies, allowing the utility to free up 280 megawatts of capacity in the Entergy system as of 2023. Other customers also could have been required to conserve energy.

Two days after the outages, it remains unclear how other factors might have been at play. Higher than forecast temperatures could have contributed, but Logan Burke, head of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, noted that Entergy and Cleco were required to shed 600 megawatts of power, a huge amount that makes it unlikely bad weather forecasts can totally explain it.

“The question is, what else do we not know about?” Burke said, noting it’s unknown whether non-nuclear power plants or transmission lines were out of service during the event.

“I can imagine MISO missing 100 megawatts,” Burke added. “600 is just hard to fathom where that’s coming from.”

MISO said that “unplanned” outages of generators and transmission structures contributed to the power losses. But neither MISO, nor Entergy and Cleco, have provided more information about which generators and transmission lines were down.

A MISO communication shared with The Times-Picayune shows the grid operator was aware of a “planned outage,” then another unit went down, though the communication does not specify which units. Entergy had a separate nuclear plant, Waterford, that was down for scheduled maintenance, which is normal in the spring.

“Operating conditions over the weekend required us to take our absolute last resort action to maintain reliability in our South Region — a temporary, controlled load shed,” MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said Tuesday. “We will conduct a thorough assessment of the event and provide additional information once complete.”

Entergy had taken its Waterford plant down for scheduled maintenance well ahead of the event so it could fix it up ahead of peak summer demand, spokesperson Brandon Scardigli. He said Entergy had been monitoring warmer than usual temperatures, but its own models did not show the need for load shedding. He said MISO uses a different model with a broader view of system conditions.

And while River Bend was offline, he said Entergy made that outage known to MISO for its modeling several days before.

“While the River Bend generating unit was offline during the event, it had been out for several days before the event, and its outage was accounted for in the generation that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans made available to MISO and in MISO’s own modeling,” Scardigli said.

'Forecasting was off'

Federal energy regulators began encouraging the creation of grid operators like MISO decades ago as a way to make sure the market for wholesale electricity was fair and reliable. MISO was formed as a nonprofit in the late 90s and has grown to operate the grid — and wholesale electric markets — across a wide swath of middle America.

In 2013, under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice amid its investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices, Entergy joined MISO, creating a new region called MISO South.

Employees in a cavernous facility in Carmel, Indiana, MISO’s headquarters, sit in front of a huge array of screens showing information about the electric grid in its territory. They plan for which power plants dispatch power onto the grid to make sure electricity flows smoothly and at the right levels.

Another grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool, was doing similar work last month when operators identified “instability” on the grid and ordered SWEPCO to shed power, causing blackouts for 30,000 people in the Shreveport area.

Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, a Republican who is one of five statewide utility regulators in Louisiana, has long opposed Entergy’s participation in MISO, arguing the utility could get a better deal elsewhere.

Skrmetta said he believes there was enough power and transmission in the region when MISO ordered the load shed over the weekend. He said MISO should have known ahead of time that River Bend was down.

“They plan it a day ahead, two days ahead,” Skrmetta said. “There’s absolutely no reason for MISO to call this unless MISO made a mistake.”

Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat representing New Orleans, said he was initially told a plant unexpectedly went offline, leading him to believe River Bend tripping offline was the source of the problem. After NRC’s confirmation that River Bend went down much earlier, Lewis said a “misforecast” along with generators and transmission lines being out appears to be the root of the problem.

Lewis said he remains concerned about how Entergy’s inability to import power using long-range transmission might have played a part.

“The forecasting was off somewhere,” he said.

Councilmember JP Morrell, chair of the City Council’s utility committee, said he expects to get answers from MISO and Entergy during their meeting next week.

Morrell said he’s particularly concerned about the lack of advanced warning from MISO that demand was outstripping supply, as well as who decided which parts of Entergy’s territory would have the lights turned off.

“If we knew as early as Wednesday of last week that generation was gonna be a problem, it would have given regulators the ability to ... curb demand to avoid the brownout,” Morrell said.

He added that while Louisiana is not yet in summer peak electricity demand, lots of power companies do their maintenance this time of year, which can cause supply issues.

Long-standing issues

Entergy has long had issues with some of its nuclear plants, including Grand Gulf, the source of years of litigation over alleged mismanagement. A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists published Tuesday found River Bend was the most problematic nuclear plant in the U.S., when measuring regulatory violations.

Entergy told the NRC, which oversees nuclear plants, that it noticed an unidentified leak in River Bend’s cooling system last week. Nuclear plants have a series of pipes circulating water to cool down the reactor. Entergy identified a faulty valve in one of those systems, and the leak reached a threshold — two gallons per minute over a 24-hour period — that required operators to shut the plant down and fix it.

Entergy welded the valve over the weekend and brought the plant back online Monday. As of Tuesday morning, it was operating at 80% capacity, Dricks said.

Energy advocates in recent days pointed to a long-standing lack of transmission as a potential part of the problem, too. Transmission lines can carry power long distances, but a lack of Entergy lines in south Louisiana creates what experts call “load pockets,” where it’s difficult to import electricity.

Over the weekend, prices for electricity soared in south Louisiana, according to MISO data, while prices in nearby states were low, underscoring Entergy’s lack of ability to import electricity from elsewhere.

Regulators have scrutinized Entergy’s lack of transmission lines in the past. Staff of the Public Service Commission noted that Entergy failed to explore new transmission options in its most recent long-range planning process. Staff said in a 2023 report that utilities in other states evaluate transmission lines as a way to bring more capacity into an area, but Entergy doesn’t unless it’s tied to a specific power plant.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/90/b90425a4-779b-11eb-bcfc-f7d62f9d741a/5fea8320d65ae.image.jpg?crop=1741%2C914%2C0%2C137&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-28 10:14:40.370419

Read the report: Embracing Clean Heat: Opportunities for Zero-Emission Industrial Boilers

See the interactive map: National Map of Industrial Boilers

The report provides a detailed overview of the industrial boiler landscape, currently dominated by fuel-combusting units. It introduces a first-of-its-kind national dataset that maps nearly 14,000 combustion boilers across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, offering vital insights into the scale and geographic distribution of pollution emitted by these units.

“A strengthened manufacturing base in the United States can help revitalize communities in our country that have been left behind for too long,” said Andres Restrepo, report co-author and Sierra Club attorney. “However, its promise will be lost if manufacturers remain dependent on the fossil fuels that drive climate change and that pollute our air and water. As our report shows, by embracing clean technologies like heat pumps, policymakers can take a huge step cleaning up industry and paving the way for a healthier, more prosperous future for all.”

Key findings

Boilers are a major source of harmful pollution: Alongside their massive emissions of greenhouse gases, combustion boilers release enormous amounts of conventional pollutants that can impair lung and cardiovascular health, cause cancer, and lead to premature death. For instance, industrial boilers emit more smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) than major industrial sectors like coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, and cement plants.

Boiler pollution disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities: 66 percent of the highest-emitting boilers are located in federally designated disadvantaged communities, where average annual NOx emissions are nearly double the national average. Moreover, 25 percent of boilers are located in areas that already exceed legal air pollution limits.

Boiler populations are heavily concentrated: Nearly 40 percent of boilers in the dataset are located in one of five states: California, Minnesota, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas.

Fortunately, clean alternatives for generating industrial heat—such as heat pumps, conventional electric boilers, and thermal energy storage—are already commercially available. These technologies can deliver industrial heat without on-site emissions and can dramatically reduce both greenhouse gas and conventional pollutant emissions, even when accounting for upstream electricity generation.

Despite the significantly higher efficiency—especially in the case of heat pumps, which can reach efficiencies of up to 400 percent—clean alternatives to combustion boilers have yet to gain widespread adoption in the industrial sector. This slow uptake underscores the crucial role that policymakers, particularly at the state and local level, must play in facilitating the transition to zero-emission industrial heat. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the economic landscape surrounding boiler electrification and presents a comprehensive roadmap spanning economic, legal, and policy strategies to accelerate the deployment of clean thermal technology across U.S. manufacturing.

Policy recommendations

State-level clean air standards: States can leverage their existing legal authority to set stricter emissions standards on industrial boilers, going beyond outdated or absent federal regulations. By targeting pollutants like NOx and CO2 pollution at the source, states can protect public health and advance climate goals simultaneously.

Strategic investment in electrification: States can close the cost gap between fossil-fueled and electric boilers through targeted measures such as production tax credits, workforce development programs, and clean heat incentives. These investments will not only accelerate decarbonization, but also create high-quality jobs, especially in disadvantaged and frontline communities.

Utility rate reform: Public utility commissions can modernize industrial rate structures to reward electrification and on-site energy storage, reflecting their benefits for grid flexibility and long-term savings.

In addition to the main report, Evergreen Action and Sierra Club have also provided appendices that include references for further study, real-world case studies of covered technologies, and a comprehensive methodology of the dataset development process, as well as an executive summary of the report.

“Industrial boilers represent a huge opportunity,” said Trevor Dolan, report co-author and Evergreen Action industry and workforce senior policy lead. “By stepping in with supportive policies, states can correct market failures, drive meaningful emissions reductions, and help manufacturers modernize for a more competitive, low-carbon future—while protecting the communities that have long borne the brunt of industrial pollution. This is the moment for states to lead and finally take on one of the dirtiest, most overlooked sources of industrial pollution.”

“Switching from dirty, outdated boilers to clean, modern heat systems is one of the smartest ways to cut pollution and save money in the long run,” said Justine Hackimer, Ohio River Valley Institute (ORVI) industrial decarbonization program manager. “Boiler pollution is a serious problem in Pennsylvania—but the good news is that, as this report shows, we have real solutions. With nearly $400 million available through the state’s RISE PA program, local manufacturers have a great opportunity to lead the way in building a cleaner, healthier future for our communities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-28 11:09:48.951356

""They need not to take advantage of this moment and put us at even greater risk,"" Uhlmann asserted.","Minnesota has its own carbon emissions reduction goals in place but under a changing federal Environmental Protection Agency, it is an open question how stalled pollution enforcement will affect the Great Lakes region.

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are taking steps to limit the reach of the EPA, including loosening regulations for laws like the Clean Air Act, along with staffing cuts. Watchdogs said new federal cases targeting pollution violators have ground to a halt.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center and a former environmental crimes prosecutor who worked under both Republican and Democratic leadership, said it is unusual.

""The environmental laws require EPA, working with the states, to protect the environment,"" Learner explained. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

States can try to fill gaps but Uhlmann noted history has shown the federal government sets the tone in going after violators. He argued diminished enforcement hurts communities' health and creates a competitive disadvantage for companies complying with federal orders. The agency's new leaders have said overhauls save taxpayers money and align with the President's promise to ""unleash American energy.""

Minnesota is one of six states in the EPA's Region Five, which Uhlmann described as one of the more active parts of the country for enforcement. He pointed out the Great Lakes have come a long way from their reputations as big, polluted waterways in the 1970s.

""Year in and year out, there's more enforcement cases brought in Region 5, and some of the biggest cases are brought in Region 5,"" Uhlmann emphasized. ""Not because Region 5's more polluted than the rest of the United States, but EPA has committed more resources to the area. The population density is significant, the amount of industry is significant.""

The Environmental Law and Policy Center said public polling indicates most Americans want clean air and water. Uhlmann underscored the bipartisan sentiments trace back to the Nixon White House creating the EPA. But with political forces now a factor, he urged private companies to hold firm.

""They need not to take advantage of this moment and put us at even greater risk,"" Uhlmann asserted. ""They need to step up and say, 'You know what? The private sector has a responsibility here, too.' They need to be good stewards of the environment.""

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

There are more than 20,000 abandoned oil and gas wells scattered across West Virginia, putting communities at risk for water contamination and increased exposure to environmental pollutants.

State lawmakers said a new law will make it easier to fill those wells. Previously, state code required removal of mining infrastructure before wells could be plugged with cement and other materials.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

Indiana's rural communities could lose out under a new federal bill aimed at speeding up clean energy development.

What Republicans are calling the One Big Beautiful Bill, part of President Donald Trump's tax package, includes major changes to how energy and infrastructure projects get environmental approval.

Lawmakers rewrote parts of the National Environmental Policy Act, to shorten timelines and block lawsuits that often delay big builds.

Supporters say the changes will fast-track everything from solar farms to broadband.

But Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, warned that the new rules may push developers to focus on easier, cheaper sites.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing Environmental Protection Agency general counsel, who say that 90% of the details NEPA review are purely there for litigation proofing,"" said Hochman. ""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said.
It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.” Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added.
Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.
Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement.","After Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis toured a battery module manufacturing facility located about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City airport, among open lands and farms in Tooele County, he reflected on an oil embargo in the ’70s that had deep impacts on the country’s economy.

Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.

“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.’”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

Tax bill proposal terminating clean energy credits may increase Utahns’ energy costs

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.

“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.

Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.

“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”

As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world.

The new office, located in New York, marks Centrica Energy’s intention to enter the North American gas optimisation business during 2025, following the entry into power markets during 2024.

The initial team on the ground will be focused on building a physical gas business. Beyond that, the company sees the potential to build an integrated gas, power and certificates optimisation business in North America over time.

This represents an important step into the US energy trading market for Centrica Energy. This expansion will enhance Centrica Energy’s gas and power trading capabilities and allow the company to better serve its clients across the globe.

For the past 20 years, Centrica Energy has traded power, gas, liquified natural gas and green certificates, connecting energy producers, suppliers and offtakers in wholesale energy markets. Leveraging the expertise Centrica Energy has built, the talent in the US market, and the company’s technological advantages, the goal is to optimise energy flows both in established and emerging markets.

There is significant potential for Centrica Energy to leverage its trading and optimisation competencies in the North American markets. Many states across the USA are undergoing a rapid buildout of inflexible generation, which means North American power markets are seeing large price fluctuations. Centrica Energy will enable integration and maximise the efficiency of energy use in the power grid, supporting security of supply in North American power markets whilst delivering lower energy costs for businesses and consumers.

The company will also look to utilise its expertise in global gas trading between international markets, supporting US producers to maximise the impact their product can have while supporting the use of natural gas to enable the energy transition.

Chris O’Shea, Group Chief Executive, Centrica said: “We are incredibly excited about the opening of our new office in New York. It underscores our commitment to growing our business and enhancing our capabilities for existing and new customers and will help us deliver on our strategy to support energy security, affordability and decarbonisation in key markets around the world.”

Cassim Mangerah, Managing Director of Centrica Energy, said: ""The opening of our new office in the United States will strengthen our presence in one of the world's most important energy markets. We have already completed our first power trades on the North American continent, and this is the next step for Centrica Energy. This expansion is a testament to our commitment to delivering commercial growth and supporting the energy transition on a global scale.""

Centrica Energy currently operates out of eight offices across all time zones to move energy from source to use. The company traded 252 LNG cargoes in 2024, showcasing its extensive reach and capabilities. With 16.7GW of electricity generating capacity under management, 850+ industry specialists, and two decades of experience, Centrica Energy is uniquely placed to drive growth in this new market.","https://centrica2023we.azurewebsites.net/media/5okdbzmw/265a9103-1.jpg?rxy=0.535853203052477,0.42911063679569067&width=900&height=500&v=1d9f154b8a0c0b0",N,,2025-05-28 10:14:48.122372

It doesn't have a support structure, meaning pedestrians can still enjoy the full width of the sidewalk.

The Level 2 charger can provide up to 22 kW of power through a 400V three-phase electrical connection.

Curbside electric-vehicle charging is great. It’s very convenient, especially when you need to do stuff for a few hours away from home. The chargers are usually mounted on some sort of pole or support structure—maybe shaped like a parking meter, or even a lamppost itself—but that can take away some space for pedestrians.

Now, though, there’s a solution, and it comes from a rather unusual company. Rheinmetall is Europe’s largest arms maker, but the German company is also knee-deep in the mobility game. And its solution is to simply replace concrete curbs with discrete Level 2 EV chargers.

Photo by: Rheinmetall

The product is called simply the Curb Charger, and it’s exactly that. A 176-pound (80-kilogram) modular lump of stainless steel and aluminum that houses all the necessary equipment to deliver up to 22 kilowatts of power to an electric vehicle.

It has an integrated 4G modem and Ethernet port, as well as an RFID reader and a display. The charger can be controlled via a smartphone app or by scanning an RFID card or QR code. It’s IP68 rated, meaning it can be submerged in water that’s at least 3.2 feet (1.0 meter) deep for at least 30 minutes.

Rheinmetall says the encapsulated electronics can withstand any type of weather and that the enclosure has built-in drains, so that even if it pours, it can still safely deliver power to a connected EV. To make a point, the company has a video where someone pours a bucket of water over the charging cable.

In case the water level rises on the street, there’s a water level sensor that cuts power. There’s also a built-in heating system for when it’s very cold outside, which ensures the charger is always snow- and ice-free.

Speaking of the cable, the charger doesn’t come with one. The enclosure sits flush with the sidewalk, so EV drivers need to have their own Type 2 cable in the trunk—but that’s rarely an issue, especially in Europe, where curbside charging is typically a bring-your-own plug affair that most drivers are already used to.

Charging operators also have it easy after installing the Curb Charger because if something goes wrong with one unit, it can simply be replaced with a fresh one, thanks to a quick-release system that separates the metal enclosure from the electronic module.

For the past year, Rheinmetall ran a field trial with four curb chargers in Germany, and the results are impressive. The chargers had an uptime of over 99% and provided over 2,800 charging sessions over 12 months, in all kinds of weather.

With any luck, innovative charging solutions like this one will catch on in other parts of the world as well.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBqK8b/s1/rheinmetall-curb-charger.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 12:27:56.157351

It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.” Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added.
Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.
“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah.
Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement.","After Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis toured a battery module manufacturing facility located about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City airport, among open lands and farms in Tooele County, he reflected on an oil embargo in the ’70s that had deep impacts on the country’s economy.

Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.

“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.’”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

Tax bill proposal terminating clean energy credits may increase Utahns’ energy costs

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.

“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.

Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.

“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”

As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world. But, he suggested that state goals could be more ambitious.

“I was teasing in the other room, our governor wants to increase the amount of energy that we produce by double in the next 10 years. And if he were here, I’d put my arm around him and say, ‘governor, I love you. But that is not enough,’” Curtis said about Gov. Spencer Cox’s Operation Gigawatt. “There are demands coming on energy that far exceed doubling in 10 years.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0960-scaled-e1748393887426-2048x1707.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 09:08:20.760419

As part of the announcement, Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte joined President Trump at the White House alongside other industry leaders. The event marked a historic moment in the administration’s effort to secure America’s energy future and unleash American energy dominance.

“These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

The executive orders direct agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to operate more effectively as both customers and enablers of new energy technologies. Oklo supports efforts to empower the DOE, DoD, and NRC to use existing authorities more efficiently and to prioritize performance-based, mission-aligned reviews.

Oklo is developing U.S. invented fast fission power plants capable of recycling used nuclear material and converting it into clean, firm power. The company is the only advanced nuclear developer with an active site use permit from the DOE, a fuel award through a competitive DOE and Idaho National Laboratory program, and active regulatory traction with the NRC for its first commercial power plant.

The executive orders also emphasize the importance of using existing feedstock of domestic nuclear fuel feedstock to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience. Oklo’s fuel award for its first core load is sourced from used nuclear fuel material from the successful Experimental Breeder Reactor II program. This DOE fast reactor demonstration operated for decades and proved the viability of both fast reactor technology and recycling used fuel. The company’s power plants are designed to use either fresh High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium or recycled used nuclear material.

The executive orders reaffirm the United States’ strategic commitment to leading the world in advanced nuclear energy, a vision Oklo is advancing through its demonstrated technology and efforts to enable commercial deployment at scale.

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale; establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes; and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel material from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

Significant progress has been made since the plans were first introduced in 2018, but stronger efforts are needed from Member States to align policies, mobilise private investment, and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.

NECPs are the cornerstone of EU Member States’ commitments to meet shared climate and energy goals, serving as detailed roadmaps for decarbonisation, energy efficiency, and energy security. EU Member States are required to submit National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), under the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.

EU Targets

The EU’s climate targets include a reduction of at least 55% in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and full climate neutrality by 2050. On the energy side, the objectives relate to renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy security. By 2030, at least 42.5% of gross final energy consumption should come from renewable sources, with a 11.7% reduction in energy consumption compared to 2020, and at least 15% of electricity interconnection capacity between Member States.

NECPs include a full overview of national energy and climate targets, describing existing and planned policies with their related impacts as well as the investment needs under different scenarios. They provide information across five energy topics:

decarbonisation covering renewable energy, GHG emissions and removals

energy efficiency

energy security

internal energy markets

research, innovation and competitiveness.

NECPs are a vital tool for meeting EU targets with the European Commission stressing that the NECPs “must evolve into strategic investment plans that foster investment predictability, consumer confidence, innovation and market growth for clean technologies” as stated in its ‘Action Plan for Affordable Energy’. With this, the European Commission is affirming one of the core purposes of the NECPs: to enhance regulatory and investor certainty and to fully exploit opportunities for economic development, investment stimulation, job creation and social cohesion.

This investment-focused approach is essential if plans are to translate into action. As underlined in the EU-wide assessment of the final NECPs released today, unlocking the full potential of these plans requires a sharper alignment with market signals, private capital flows, and industrial policy priorities.

To meet its 2030 climate and energy goals, the EU needs approximately €570 billion in annual investments, which requires a strategic mix of public funding and leveraged private capital. While some Member States have improved investment planning in their NECPs, many still lack clear financing strategies, especially regarding private sector involvement.

The Commission has issued a clear call to these Member States to step up efforts to unlock the investments needed to meet the targets. Member States are urged to better identify investment needs, adopt supportive tax systems, and use EU funding and technical assistance to implement NECPs and build a competitive, resilient clean economy. The Commission aims to support this through initiatives like the Clean Industrial Deal, boosting InvestEU’s risk capacity, and introducing a Clean Energy Investment Strategy. A reformed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will prioritize clean transition funding, with simplified access via tools such as the Competitiveness Fund and Innovation Fund.

Since 2018, when the first NECPs were submitted, Ricardo has been supporting this policymaking process and our sustainability experts have been working with the industrial sector to accelerate decarbonisation in line with EU targets.

One of Ricardo’s renowned energy policy experts, Eugenia Bonifazi, will be sharing key insights and specialist knowledge on the topic at the European Sustainable Energy Week (10-12 June 2025, Brussels) in the policy session “An energy union that delivers: National Energy and Climate Plans”, chaired by the Directorate-General for Energy of the European Commission. The focus of the session will be on the key takeaways that can be drawn from NECPs today, and, looking ahead, how we ensure that they guide the investments needed in the three core areas of the EU’s Competitiveness Compass: innovation, decarbonisation and security. Eugenia will bring her experience as the leader and manager of the consortium assisting the European Commission in the assessment of the draft and final NECPs.

Auto Shanghai had plenty of oddballs too.
Six years on, and with JLR absent from Shanghai 2025, China no longer feels the need to copy the West.
Audi hit the Caps Lock key and used Auto Shanghai to reveal the first car of its China-only sub-brand, called AUDI.","It has long been said that visiting China from the West is akin to landing in a parallel universe. Pick any major city and most aspects look and feel broadly familiar, yet the fundamentals are different. You can’t hail an Uber or use Google Maps to get around, and your hotel TV won’t have Netflix. Instead, there’s always a domestic alternative. One that is likely newer, bigger, quicker, and perhaps even better than what you’re used to back home.

And so to the Chinese car industry, whose latest opportunity to scare the living daylights out of Europe and the US came at the Auto Shanghai motor show. Held at the world’s second-largest exhibition space, the show saw more than 1,400 cars from 26 countries spread across 13 halls. Some 93 vehicles made their world debut in front of 1 million attendees. YouTubers would later upload whole-show walk-throughs with run times longer than Interstellar.

How many world debuts do you suppose took place at the 2024 Geneva International Motor Show? About a dozen. No wonder it was canceled for 2025.

To Western eyes, photos of Auto Shanghai are akin to asking ChatGPT to recreate the glory days of motor shows past. Anyone who strolled the cavernous convention halls of Paris, Frankfurt, Geneva, Detroit, even Birmingham, and gawped at the new and the exciting will recognize the scene. There’s lots of shiny metal and carbon, formed into cars of every conceivable size, shape and social status. But the badges are unfamiliar, model names nonsensical; prices implausibly low, performance claims from another planet.

Admittedly, some cars are dressed in fur like children’s toys, complete with bunny ears and tail, but perhaps that’s just the AI hallucinating. This still largely looks like the sort of auto show Europe and the US hosted every few months in a prepandemic world.

Names like Jetour, Denza, iCar, Changan, Hongqi and Luxeed won’t ring many bells. Keep walking and you’ll catch a reassuring glimpse of Audi, Lotus, Buick, and Volkswagen, but the spark of familiarity they bring is quickly extinguished by a stark realization: They are no longer in Shanghai to show the fledgling locals how it’s done, as beacons of a Western industry riding high on a century of success. They’re surrounded by younger, fitter, and keener rivals with a hunger to put a ding in the universe. And there’s about to be a feeding frenzy.

Award Winners and Oddballs

Highlights of this year’s Shanghai show included the Jetour G900, a range-extended electric SUV with two rear-mounted turbines for use as a boat; an electric Porsche 911 rival from BYD-owned Denza; the award-winning Xpeng M03 Mona; and the Maextro S800, a Maybach-rivaling luxury sedan from Huawei.

Yes, that Huawei. The telecom company oversees the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA), which includes car brands like AITO, Stelato, and SAIC, itself another auto group that includes Roewe, Rising Auto, Wuling, and former British sports car maker MG, among others.

There was also Luxeed, a brand related to both Huawei and Chery, the latter of which sold over 2.5 million cars in 2024 and is the parent of Jaecoo, Omoda, Lepas and iCar. Those names might not be familiar to you yet, but they soon will be. Many will land on your radar because of their low prices. Dig a little deeper and you’ll find that the Jaecoo 7, a well-priced hybrid SUV, is already selling over 700 units a month in the UK. A nose-diving Tesla registered just 536 cars there in April.

Auto Shanghai had plenty of oddballs too. Ora followed up on its Funky Cat with the Ballet Cat, which curiously borrows much of its styling from the original VW Beetle. Songsan filled its stand with cars inspired by late-’50s Americana, including a seven-door take on the VW Microbus and a proportionally challenged revival of a first-generation Corvette. A handful of cars appeared to be inexplicably dressed as cuddly toys, one sharing its stand with a giant comb. Another, the Baojun Yep, had a massive ice cream cone dunked on its roof for reasons unclear.

320 Miles in 5 Minutes

Such fever dreams won't give Western brands sleepless nights, but the EV technology coming out of China in 2025 certainly will. BYD used the Shanghai show to reveal a charging system powerful enough to deliver 259 miles of range in five minutes, at a peak speed of 1,000 kW—10 times the charge rate of a Mini Cooper.

Soon after, domestic rival CATL went one better with its 1,300 kW of charging power, enough to deliver 323 miles of range in five minutes. For context, Europe’s fastest-charging EVs, like the Porsche Taycan, fill their batteries at a mere 320 kW.

As well as dazzling tech, Chinese automakers are also majoring on small, low-price cars that appeal to Europe, the UK, and even emerging markets. Perfectly decent EVs—on paper, at least—are soon expected to land below the €20,000 ($22,700) barrier. Established marques like Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault should soon be there too. But with models like the VW ID.1 not due in showrooms until 2027, cut-price alternatives from China’s Leapmotor, Lepas, and Firefly could quickly sweep up all the drivers wondering whatever happened to the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Up.

Things Sure Have Changed

It wasn’t always this way. Oh, how we once laughed when each year brought a Chinese motor show filled with poor imitations of European bestsellers.

Rewind a decade—just a single generation in car years—and the cream of Europe’s prestigious brands would reveal world-beating hypercars in the convention halls of Geneva and Paris, while China’s auto shows were, to the West, a laughing stock. Glitzy as they may have been, the show floors of Beijing and Shanghai in the mid-2010s featured flagrant knockoffs of British and European cars. Brands like Changan, BYD, Zotye, and Hongqi revealed vehicles unashamedly aping the latest designs of Mercedes, Ford, Land Rover, McLaren, and Porsche.

The most infamous of all the copycats was the Landwind X7, which looked so similar to the Range Rover Evoque that, after four years of legal battles, a Chinese court ruled in favor of JLR, demanding the car be taken off sale and the British company awarded compensation.

Six years on, and with JLR absent from Shanghai 2025, China no longer feels the need to copy the West. Instead, it is the US and Europe being forced to play catch-up. Audi hit the Caps Lock key and used Auto Shanghai to reveal the first car of its China-only sub-brand, called AUDI.

Lowercase Audi said AUDI’s new E5 Sportback “offers the very best qualities of Audi, reimagined for and tailored to customers in China.” The German company claimed its engineering prowess is being blended with China’s own digital ecosystems and innovations, and that the AUDI division, which drops the iconic four-ringed logo, marks the beginning of a new era for the company in the region, “ensuring rapid response to the evolving demands of the Chinese market.” It will be interesting to see if this China-flavored AUDI Audi—reversing the trend of Chinese makers increasingly nailing the Western auto taste—is a success.

Some Western brands might need a rapid-response unit of their own, since not only are their sales falling in China, but the popularity of Chinese upstarts elsewhere is surging. BYD expects to double its overseas sales in a single year, rising from 417,000 vehicles in 2024 to over 800,000 in 2025. With US sales on ice, an increasingly brand-agnostic UK is poised to become a key battleground for BYD, along with Latin America and Southeast Asia.

Elon Musk’s biggest headache has also found success in Australia, where BYD sales hit 40,000 units in 2024 (matching those of a Tesla rapidly heading in the opposite direction), and are on track to double in 2025. Where Tesla has failed to expand its two-vehicle lineup, BYD has grown from one model in Australia in 2022, to six just three years later.

China’s Smart Western Hiring Spree

It’s easy to credit Beijing’s massive investment in China’s nascent auto sector as a prime contributor to its success. But China’s closing of the gap to, and in many cases overtaking, US and European carmakers isn’t due to cash and copying alone. Just as the Japanese and Korean brands did before them, the Chinese have hired smartly.

Luxury sedan maker Hongqi took on Rolls-Royce design head Giles Taylor as its own global vice president of design in 2018. Similarly, Bentley design chief Stefam Sielaff headed to Geely in 2021, while 2024 saw Jozef Kaban—whose pencil gave us the era-defining Bugatti Veyron—swap Audi for MG, a part of Chinese giant SAIC. Stellantis UK managing director Maria Grazia Davino moved to BYD that same year, and JuanMa Lopez, who spent a decade as head of exterior design at Ferrari, moved to Xpeng.

Back to Shanghai, and the hits kept on coming. The Nio ET7 promised 620 miles of range from a battery bigger than that of a Rolls-Royce Spectre. The Huawei AITO M9 SUV has a projector screen for entertaining passengers in the second and third rows. The Chery iCar C23, a small electric off-road with the approach and departure angles of a mountain goat, is priced at the equivalent of $13,000 (and is coming to the UK in 2026, to the delight of Suzuki Jimny fans).

Headed to the Australian market for under $30,000, the Deepal E07 gave the Tesla Cybertruck a lesson in practicality, with the ability to transform its cargo area from the interior of an SUV to the open bed of a truck.

Riding the Wave

And it wasn’t just a show for EVs. Gas-powered cars shared the floor with all manner of hybrids, range-extended EVs that use engines as generators, and even old-school, stick-shift trucks with turbo-diesel engines ready to conquer emerging markets with rock-bottom prices.

At the other end of the market, Hongqi showed off vehicles with the thick carpets, dashboard artwork, and limitless customization normally reserved for Rolls-Royce. Its Guoyue luxury minibus even riffs on Rolls’ headliner filled with twinkling LED stars.

But focusing on what China’s still bunging into the photocopier misses the point. Here is an auto industry that—after substantial government support, it must be reiterated—is booming like no other. And, most worryingly of all, it’s an industry no longer content with serving its own enormous market.

Chinese brands are already making serious inroads across Australia and Europe. In May, it was reported that, for the first time, BYD sold more cars on the continent than Tesla in the previous month. BYD only entered Europe in 2020, and it waited two years before even expanding beyond Norway and the Netherlands.

Tesla’s growth at the start of this decade was equally staggering, but from the US there has been no follow-up act. Faraday Future was a failure, Slate Auto is fun but niche. Cash-hemorrhaging Lucid and Rivian are yet to touch foreign shores, and meanwhile behind BYD the tide has just gone out, and a tsunami is about to hit.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6835ff0c14a5496c30615334/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/shanghai-auto-show-gear-2212245139.jpg",N,,2025-05-28 10:15:42.430838

The data is available for 2001–2019 which is used as the calibration period to develop both the historical and future hydropower data at every available hydropower plant location.
Hydropower model validation The first validation of the B1hydro model is designed to test the regression model using drop-one-year cross validation.
In this procedure one year of data is dropped and the other years are used to predict the missing generation data.
One outcome of the 9505 assessment is the development of a hydropower dataset that uses a selection of hydrologic models, hydropower models, forcing datasets.28 Here we compare with two hydrology models, Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)29 and VIC, two hydropower models, wmpy-power (WMP) and WRES28, and one forcing dataset, Livneh30.","Hydropower is a critical electricity resource in the United States (U.S.) accounting for an average 6.63% of annual utility scale generation from 2013 to 2023.1 Hydropower can also provide a range of ancillary services such as load factoring, operating reserves, voltage support, and blackstart that are especially valuable as low-cost non-dispatchable resources are added to the grid.2 Despite the importance of hydropower to the grid, there are limited comprehensive datasets available from which to study both historical and future impacts of climate, weather driven energy droughts, and integration of other weather driven generation. In this paper, we present a hydropower generation dataset covering 1,452 hydroelectric plants in the contiguous U.S comprised of both federal and privately owned facilities. The dataset contains monthly and weekly hydropower generation estimates for both historical (1982–2019) and future (2020–2099) periods, the latter containing 4 different climate scenarios.

Power system models such as production cost models (PCMs) represent the power system as an optimization problem where energy demands are met with both dispatchable resources such as natural gas and non-dispatchable resources such as wind and solar. These models often treat hydropower as a dispatchable resource which requires operational constraints such as power targets, minimum generation, maximum generation, and ramping rates which serve as approximations of true hydropower operations. The data presented here includes these operational constraints and so can be readily used to represent nearly all existing conventional U.S. hydropower generation in power system models.

The development of hydropower generation and power constraints requires a series of models and data including meteorology, hydrology, routing, water management, and hydropower (Fig. 1). A distributed hydrology model takes meteorology data as input and computes gridded runoff, based on the calibrated hydrologic parameters. The runoff data is passed to a routing model which develops natural streamflow estimates within a river channel network developed on a uniform 1/8th degree grid. At certain grid cells where dams are present, the routing model must take into account human management, including reservoir operations and water demands. The final model in the chain converts regulated streamflow to hydropower. The following sections describe the models in greater detail.

Meteorology Data

In this study we used perturbed thermodynamics experiments3,4 (https://tgw-data.msdlive.org/) as meteorological forcing. The forcing data is a 1/8th degree dynamically downscaled product which contains both historical data and future projections over the contiguous United States (i.e. lower 48 states), southern Canada, and northern Mexico. The dynamically downscaled data is produced by initializing a WRF5 model using ERA56 boundary conditions. The future projections are developed by replicating the historical period (1980–2019) twice in the future (2020–2059, 2060–2099) while applying a warming signal that is derived from groups of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 6 models.4 The warming scenarios are labeled as rcp45cooler, rcp45hotter, rcp85cooler, and rcp85hotter which represent a range of warming signals derived from climate models using the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios.

Hydrology Model

For hydrologic modeling we use the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model7,8 (https://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/). VIC is a commonly used model for large scale distributed hydrologic modeling studies. Parameters are obtained from the VICGlobal9 dataset which contains vegetation and soil parameters on a 1/16th degree grid. We calibrate the parameters against the Global Reach-level River Flood Reanalysis data10 which is a global dataset of 1/20th degree runoff. Calibration is conducted for 1981–2000 at 1/16th degree resolution on a grid cell by grid cell basis. For automatic calibration we use the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm11 through the Optimization Software Toolkit for Research Involving Computational Heuristics (OSTRICH) framework12 (https://doi-bor.github.io/ostrich/). The DDS algorithm is designed to provide a reasonably optimal solution within a limited computational budget, here we used 100 iterations of the DDS algorithm as testing indicated that more iterations provided marginal improvement to the objective function value. For the objective function we used the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metric of monthly observed runoff as it provides a good balance between low and high runoff conditions. The KGE metric is described further in the validation section. Table 1 shows the calibration parameters and the ranges which are selected based on previous hydrologic studies using the VIC model9,10,13,14.

Routing and Water Management Model

Routing is conducted at a 1/8th degree scale by the mosartwmpy model15 (https://mosartwmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python implementation of the MOSART-WM model,16,17 which is part of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) (https://e3sm.org/). Routing alone produces gridded natural streamflow estimates but water management is required to develop estimates of regulated streamflow, storage, inflow, and outflow for hydropower projects, which mosartwmpy produces through the use of data driven reservoir operation rules18. Hydropower projects were mapped to the 1/8th degree grid as part of the 9505 federal assessment of hydropower19.

Hydropower Model

The final model in the chain takes the regulated streamflow values produced by mosartwmpy and generates weekly and monthly hydropower estimates, which we call B1hydro. At every hydropower plant, B1hydro models the power generation as a linear regression model with the form:

$$\begin{array}{l}{P}_{t}={\beta }_{P,1}{P}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{P,n}{P}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{O,0}{O}_{t}+{\beta }_{P,1}{O}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{O,n}{O}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{I,0}{I}_{t}+{\beta }_{I,1}{I}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{I,n}{I}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{S,0}{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{S,1}{S}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{S,n}{S}_{t-n}+{\varepsilon }_{t}\end{array}$$

(1)

where Pt is the power at time t, O denotes the outflow, I denotes the inflow, S denotes the storage, which are outputs from the mosartwmpy model, βi,j are the regression parameters, and εt is the normally distributed error term. The lag parameter n is set to 12 and 52 for the monthly and weekly model respectively to account for annual hydrologic variability.

The data used to calibrate the regression parameters is the HydroWIRES B1 data20,21 (https://github.com/HydroWIRES-PNNL/B1-data), which contains weekly and monthly hydropower estimates that are disaggregated from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual data22. The data is available for 2001–2019 which is used as the calibration period to develop both the historical and future hydropower data at every available hydropower plant location. Of the 1492 plants in the HydroWIRES B1 data, 1452 are included in the GODEEEP-hydro dataset, with the 40 plants excluded due to records that were too short (less than 2 years) or containing all zero values (i.e. decommissioned). The entire historical period (1982–2019) is included in the final dataset to provide (1) validation with observations and other derived datasets, (2) an extension the historical record beyond what is available in the HydroWIRES B1 data, and (3) a consistent record of hydropower that is coincident with other datasets derived from the perturbed thermodynamics experiment data (e.g.23).

In addition to total generation over the weekly or monthly period, the B1hydro model provides minimum and maximum power generation of the period and the average daily operational range (ador), which are directly useful in power system models. These values are defined as:

$$\begin{array}{rcl}{P}_{max,t} & = & {P}_{t}+{a}_{max}({P}_{np}-{P}_{t})\\ {P}_{min,t} & = & {a}_{min}{P}_{t}\\ {P}_{ador,t} & = & {a}_{ador}\left({P}_{max,t}-{P}_{min,t}\right)\end{array}$$

(2)

where Pmax,t and Pmin,t are the max and min allowed power generation at time t, Pador,t is average daily operational range at time t, Pt is the average power generation at time t, Pnp is the nameplate capacity of the plant, and amax, amin, and aador are parameters with values between 0 and 1 which can be derived from hourly power generation data.

Hourly hydropower generation is usually proprietary and business sensitive and therefore not publicly available. The Army Corps of Engineers Northwestern Division, which includes the Columbia River Basin, is one exception where historical hourly generation data from most federally-operated hydropower facilities is published on the Dataquery platform (https://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/dd/common/dataquery/www/). The B1hydro model uses this hourly generation data to estimate the min and max power and ador at every hydropower plant in this study by assuming that amax, amin, and aador are equal to the average parameter values from all the hydropower facilities on the Dataquery platform. This approximation allows for reasonable constraints to be developed for power system models given the scarcity of publicly available hourly hydropower data.

Future Simulations

The four future climate scenarios in the TGW data (rcp45cooler, rcp45hotter, rcp85cooler, and rcp85hotter) are used to develop future hydropower simulations from 2020–2099. The calibrated VIC model is used to produce future runoff simulations for each scenario, which are then run through mosartwmpy, and finally the calibrated B1hydro model is used to produce monthly and weekly hydropower generation estimates.

The data is available from Zenodo24 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13776944).

The data is split into 10 data files, weekly and monthly data for each future scenario and the historical period. Each file has the naming convention <scenario>_ <monthly/weekly>.csv where <scenario> can be either “historical”, “rcp45cooler”, “rcp45hotter”, “rcp85cooler”, or “rcp85hotter” and <monthly/weekly> refers to the timestep of the data. Each of the data files has the following columns:

datetime The datetime stamp of the current timestep

eia_id An integer value with the EIA plant code that represents the facility

plant The name of the facility according to the EIA

power_predicted_mwh The total energy generated over the period in MWh, aka the energy target

n_hours The number of hours in the period, useful for converting between power and energy

p_avg Average power generation for the period

p_max Maximum allowable power generation for the period

p_min Minimum allowable power generation for the period

ador Average daily operational range for any given day in the period

scenario The name of the scenario, either “historical”, “rcp45cooler’, “rcp45hotter”, “rcp85cooler”, or “rcp85hotter”

Also included is the metadata file godeeep_hydro_plants.csv which contains metadata for each hydropower plant that is included in the dataset. Each row in this file refers to one hydropower facility. This file has the following columns:

eia_id An integer value with the EIA plant code that represents the facility

plant The name of the facility according to the EIA

mode Either “Storage” or “RoR” indicating if the plant is primarily operated as a storage or run-of-river facility

state Two letter U.S. state name

nerc_region Four letter code for the NERC region of the facility

ba Balacing authority of the facility

max_param Value of the amax parameter from Equation (2) used to derive p_max

min_param Value of the amin parameter from Equation (2) used to derive p_min

ador_param Value of the aador parameter from Equation (2) used to derive ador

huc2 Two digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) which contains the facility

Hydrology model validation

The VIC hydrology model is calibrated at a monthly timestep for the period 1981–2000, and validated for 2001–2019, with the period 1979–1980 used as spin-up. We use the KGE metric to assess model performance25 on simulating runoff. KGE is a commonly used metric in hydrology where any value greater than −0.41 indicates performance better than the mean26. Figure 2 shows the calibration results for the study region. The calibration results are consistently above −0.41 and frequently much higher. The calibration results align well with previous CONUS-wide calibration efforts,27 with the best performance on the east and west coast and lower performance in the Midwest region east of the Rocky Mountains. The validation period has lower performance than the calibration period, which is to be expected, but overall the periods are similar which is encouraging.

Hydropower model validation

The first validation of the B1hydro model is designed to test the regression model using drop-one-year cross validation. In this procedure one year of data is dropped and the other years are used to predict the missing generation data. Using this approach on every year of data provides a complete record from which to assess the out-of-sample performance. Figure 3 shows a histogram of the KGE of all plant level hydropower models that are part of the B1hydro model. The performance is generally good, with only 2 out of 1,452 plants having performance less than −0.41.

Additionally, we validate the B1hydro model against observed hydropower data in the Columbia River Basin. Figure 4 shows boxplots of the difference in the annual generation between observed annual hydropower and the B1hydro model output. The greatest error of about 200 aMW is seen at Grand Coulee which has the highest hydropower generation of any plant in the region. In general, the error is proportional to the nameplate capacity of the hydropower plant and tends to bracket 0, indicating reasonable annual performance with no annual bias in the B1hydro model.

Validation against 9505 data

The 9505 assessment is the Department of Energy funded assessment of the relationship between climate and hydropower in the U.S. (https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/hydropower-climate-change-assessment). One outcome of the 9505 assessment is the development of a hydropower dataset that uses a selection of hydrologic models, hydropower models, forcing datasets.28 Here we compare with two hydrology models, Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)29 and VIC, two hydropower models, wmpy-power (WMP) and WRES28, and one forcing dataset, Livneh30. To facilitate an accurate comparison, we have only compared the hydropower plants that are simulated by both datasets.

Figure 5 shows the average total monthly generation for each HUC2 in the contiguous U.S. The hydropower estimates from GODEEEP-hydro are generally in line with the 9505 estimates lending confidence to the methodology presented here. Some notable differences occur in the Great Lakes and Ohio basins where GODEEEP-hydro is higher than the 9505 models. This may be due to differences in the representation of hydropower between the U.S. and Canada.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-025-05097-3/MediaObjects/41597_2025_5097_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-05-28 10:14:56.735495

Meanwhile, in its first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen congressionally appropriated funds for clean energy and energy-efficiency incentives.
What is clear, however, is that we need more investment in clean energy, not just for the environment but also for the economy, for our own financial well-being.
To replace what was lost, we need continued federal support for jobs of the future which include clean energy.
Supporting clean energy is supporting what’s good for us, whereas cutting clean energy would hurt our physical and financial well-being and our economy.","In the summer of 2009, I had solar panels installed at my house. Rooftop solar wasn’t as widespread then as it is now, but I took the leap, and I haven’t looked back. I was so happy with my little 2.7 kilowatt solar system that, the next year, I installed a solar-powered hot-water heater to complement it. None of this would have been possible without incentives supported by the federal government, our own commonwealth and Pennsylvania Power & Light (now PPL Electric Corporation). These incentives cut the cost of installation by more than 30%, making solar power more accessible.

But now, affordable clean energy like rooftop solar could go away, as Congress considers cutting cost-saving programs at the expense of everyday people’s pocketbooks. Meanwhile, in its first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen congressionally appropriated funds for clean energy and energy-efficiency incentives.

Billions of dollars are on the line. If these federal incentives are cut, the pain would be felt across the country. Businesses, nonprofits, school districts and local governments would see their energy costs rise.

We don’t have to wait to see what would happen if these federal resources were cut. We’re getting a preview of the consequences already. Allentown hoped to leverage both state and federal energy-efficiency incentives to cut energy costs and save hundreds of thousands of local taxpayer dollars. The city had prepared a pilot program to save money by replacing aging city vehicles with electric vehicles. Just the eight vehicles in the pilot program would have saved over $19,000 per year in energy and maintenance costs. If this level of savings were applied to the city’s entire fleet of about 600 vehicles, it would add up to over $1 million of savings per year. For a city like Allentown, that’s a significant sum. But now, these programs cannot proceed because of the Trump administration’s federal funding freezes.

This scenario is playing out in cities across the country, and it will play out on an even wider scale if Congress reduces or eliminates more cost-saving federal incentives. Why anyone would want such an outcome remains unclear. If you’re concerned about government efficiency, why make it harder for local governments to save taxpayer dollars? If you’re concerned about lowering the overall cost of living, why cut funding for cost-saving clean-energy programs? Why would you propose these cuts in the midst of a growing global trade war that is already wrecking supply chains, raising prices and causing layoffs? There are no good answers to these questions.

What is clear, however, is that we need more investment in clean energy, not just for the environment but also for the economy, for our own financial well-being. This is something that I can personally speak to. My own solar array isn’t large at all but over 16 years, it has saved me more than $5,400.

Even if you put aside the environmental concerns, even if you care only about your own finances, you should care about these federal clean-energy incentives. You should want Congress to protect and expand these programs, not cut them. Even some members of Congress who are skeptical about climate change agree on this. In a letter to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, 21 Republican members of Congress wrote that getting rid of clean-energy investments “would increase utility bills the very next day.” That’s an outcome that everyone — not just environmentalists — should want to avoid.

Additionally, the job-creating benefits of these programs can’t be ignored. The growth in clean-energy jobs has been a critical part of industrial Pennsylvania’s comeback, and we should want it to continue. Cities with industrial roots, such as Allentown, need more family-sustaining jobs that don’t require a college degree, and we need leaders in Washington to support the incentives that create these jobs. But so far, all we’ve seen is talk, rhetorical nostalgia-pumping about how things were better for everyday workers in the distant past. Words will not revive our old industrial job base. To replace what was lost, we need continued federal support for jobs of the future which include clean energy. With that support, we can create the 21st-century economy that we deserve.

I don’t see this as much of a choice. Supporting clean energy is supporting what’s good for us, whereas cutting clean energy would hurt our physical and financial well-being and our economy. We don’t deserve that. Let’s hope Congress recognizes as much.

Recently, many in the clean energy industry have been bracing for change. Analysts and executives alike have predicted potential policy shifts that could affect renewable energy development.

However, I think history and market realities suggest otherwise. The clean energy industry has endured policy shifts for decades, emerging stronger due to fundamental economic advantages and evolving market dynamics.

Clean energy has become increasingly attractive in recent years for several key reasons. Here are some of the main drivers:

Energy Security

A lesson we’ve learned repeatedly is that energy security is national security. This has been clear since the 1970s energy crises.

The current administration has prioritized energy independence as a pillar of national security. While fossil fuels are often seen as the focus of this effort, renewables are becoming more important due to their role in reducing reliance on foreign energy sources. By diversifying the U.S. energy mix, renewables can help mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical supply disruptions. The ability to generate power domestically from natural resources makes renewables an important part of long-term energy security.

Market Competitiveness And Lower Energy Costs

Renewables are now among the cheapest sources of electricity, making them an attractive choice. The declining cost of solar panels, paired with improvements in efficiency and durability, ensures that market forces drive adoption.

Historically, the biggest argument against renewables was their intermittency. However, recent advancements in battery storage, AI and other breakthrough technologies have enabled the development of advanced hybrid power plants that address these concerns.

Businesses are also increasingly seeking long-term price stability, which renewables can provide more reliably than volatile fossil fuel markets.

Rapid Deployment To Support Grid Reliability And Reindustrialization

The current administration has announced that a major priority is maintaining America’s dominance in artificial intelligence. This could require expansion of the nation’s digital infrastructure as AI demands an enormous amount of affordable, reliable and readily available energy.

The U.S. power grid is already under strain due to rising energy demand from data centers, manufacturing and electrification. And the threat of rolling blackouts is becoming real. This is compounded by the fact that natural gas plants often take four to five years to build, and nuclear plants can take over a decade. Meanwhile, new utility-scale solar plants can often be deployed in 12 to 18 months.

Another solution for rapid, resilient, around-the-clock power is synthetic power systems that combine solar, natural gas and storage—which can power data centers and are usually deployable within two years. The ability to bring power online quickly and at scale is essential for meeting growing energy demand, making renewables a critical component of energy planning.

Job Creation And Rural Economic Revival

For decades, rural communities have borne the brunt of economic downturns and deindustrialization. Today, renewable energy projects are breathing new life into many of these areas—driving job creation and offering struggling communities a new hope.

Beyond jobs, renewables generate tax revenue and fund vital public services, such as K-12 education and professional training. Many farmers are leasing land for clean power projects, generating stable income streams that help sustain agricultural economies and keep land in the family for future generations.

Opportunities In The New Energy Economy

Despite potential policy shifts, numerous opportunities exist for entrepreneurs and businesses to capitalize on the growth of renewable energy, driven by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences and a growing corporate emphasis on sustainability.

Investment in clean power remains strong, and I think the demand for affordable and reliable power will likely increase, especially in regions seeing new manufacturing and data center development.

Companies can consider procuring renewable energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs), investing in on-site clean energy solutions such as solar installations and battery storage, and implementing smart grid technologies to improve energy management. These strategic actions can lower operating costs, reduce exposure to volatile energy prices and enhance long-term business resilience.

Addressing The Challenges

Despite the economic advantages, adopting clean energy isn’t without its challenges. While renewables offer speed-to-deployment advantages over fossil fuels, integrating intermittent sources like solar into a grid not originally designed for them requires significant investment in energy storage, hybrid systems and grid modernization. Additionally, permitting delays and supply chain constraints continue to slow project development.

The energy sector is also likely to face challenges like grid instability stemming from rapid load growth, potential supply chain disruptions and escalating cybersecurity risks.

To navigate these challenges, a best practice for businesses and energy providers is to adopt a diversified strategy. This can include investing in hybrid clean energy systems that combine solar, storage and gas to provide reliable 24/7 power, especially for mission-critical operations. Additionally, cultivating strong relationships with multiple suppliers and power producers can mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, ensuring continuity in operations.

Sustained collaboration with regulators and local governments is necessary to help streamline permitting processes and ensure grid upgrades keep pace with clean power deployment. In a changing energy economy, those who embrace smart, scalable and resilient clean energy strategies could be best positioned for long-term success.

Final Thoughts

Clean power is a mainstream economic force powered by price competitiveness, deployment speed and growing demand for reliable electricity. While fossil fuels will continue to play an important role in America’s energy mix, the rapid deployment of utility-scale clean power is essential for meeting the nation’s energy needs.

Business leaders who view renewable energy as an economic and strategic opportunity—not just an environmental cause—could find themselves positioned well for growth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634ea7af33fdc6b62ab5c039/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-28 09:08:28.539405

Last week, the City of Cortez was one of seven recipients to learn that on May 16, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded the city a $500,000 Brownfields Grant to clean up three unused buildings at the Cortez Municipal Airport contaminated with asbestos, lead-based paint and petroleum.

Think brown vs. green fields and you get the picture of why the EPA in 1995 established this aptly named program to return brownfields to productive use in both urban and rural communities. The premise is that brownfields funding can help communities clean up impacted sites, reduce environmental and health risks, and bolster economic development and community revitalization efforts. In some areas, former landfills have been redeveloped into community parks, new housing and businesses have been launched.

Kudos to the City of Cortez for seeking and securing this funding. Whether or not future EPA grant funding opportunities will continue to exist is unclear. Since the Trump administration came into office, DOGE has been chainsawing its way through the federal government and much of what we’ve come to expect (and taken for granted) has been thrown into question.

Under Trump, the EPA, founded in 1970 by President Richard Nixon with a charge to protect the environment and human health, is facing up to 55% cuts to its budget. As Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said last week, in a heated exchange with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, “In your view and President Donald Trump’s view, more than half the efforts to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water is just a waste.”

Environmental protection has not always been partisan. The 1970 Clean Air Act and 1972 Clean Water Act were also signed into law by Nixon. The Journal’s editorial board wishes our politicians could and would return to those days, as what is good for the environment and human health is also good for communities and economies.

We’re fortunate that Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-CO), as it applies to adversely affected small businesses and communities, recognizes this fact. In February, with Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Hurd introduced the Gold King Mine Spill Compensation Act to make whole Four Corners communities affected by the 2015 Gold King Mine spill. There is every reason this bill should continue to advance and be approved for funding by Congress. If approved, this funding would come through the EPA.

The editorial board is concerned about the future of the agency, however, as it learns it is poised to cancel another 400 grants to the already 377 that have been canceled. Grants to communities, like Cortez, for things like detecting and preventing lead poisoning in children, flood mitigation, and disaster resilience projects are all at risk. As is our nation's public and environmental health.

There is no way the agency can continue to function with a 55% reduction in budget, a return to funding at 1980s levels, and continue to provide the same protections it has for the past fifty years. We urge Rep. Hurd to fulfill his duty to protect constituents and communities and support the future of the E.P.A.",https://www.the-journal.com/wp-content/themes/durango/images/default_article_image_jor.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:31.346123

Scientific rigor, transparency, Environmental Justice, and deliberation are fundamental to good government and can only be achieved through a robust NEPA process. As the current administration moves to gut the law, at the behest of extractive industries seeking to maximize profits, Congress and the US public must come to its defense.

A simple premise: productive harmony

Despite rhetoric from the oil, gas, and mining industries, NEPA is not complicated. The original statute stands for two basic propositions:

Before a federal agency funds or permits something with significant environmental impacts, it should consider alternatives, including no action at all; and

Before the agency makes the final decision, it should invite input from the people who will have to live with the consequences.

Section 101 of the statute states the aim of the law even more simply: “to create and maintain conditions under which [people] and nature can exist in productive harmony.”

And yet, the idea that potential impacts on people in surrounding communities should be considered before any significant federal action is taken was novel when NEPA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970. Much of US history is marked by unbridled resource extraction and rampant pollution from industrial development, with little or no consideration of the consequences to our air, land, and water.

And if the idea of environmental protection was new, the concepts of government transparency and public input were downright radical. NEPA stands for the proposition that even the most powerful federal agency should have to at least consider the views of average members of the US public before charging ahead.

After complying with NEPA’s requirements, however, that agency can still charge right ahead. The statute dictates a process, not an outcome, and the federal government can decide not to abide by the most environmentally conscious alternative.

As the Supreme Court explained in 1989, “NEPA merely prohibits uninformed–rather than unwise–agency action.”

The NEPA process is intended to take place concurrently with all other aspects of planning and implementation of a project. If project proponents go back to the drawing board a few times, or experience funding delays, or run afoul of the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act, that all takes place during the “NEPA process.”

This parallel structure has been manipulated by NEPA critics, who are eager to use anecdotal evidence to erroneously blame NEPA for project delays of years or even decades. Most experts agree that, given the various exemptions adopted over the years, size of the federal regulatory docket, and federal agency’s organized strategies to evade the statute, the allegations that NEPA stifles progress are overblown.

The state of play

Watching NEPA implementation recently has been like watching tennis. The Obama Administration sought to expand NEPA consideration of greenhouse gas emissions, among other changes, but then the first Trump Administration sought to truncate application of the law. The Biden Administration reversed the Trump guidance, but then Congress narrowed the statute somewhat in the 2023. The Biden Administration then worked to implement the changes, along with some improvements to the regulations. Central to efforts to update NEPA by the Obama and Biden Administrations was the seemingly obvious idea that a process designed to assess environmental impacts should account for pollution that would worsen climate change.

Most recently, under the guise of an “energy emergency,” the Trump Administration has sought to repeal existing NEPA regulations and guidance, leaving individual departments and agencies to develop their own requirements for complying with the statute. In March, UCS joined 250 organizations in a comment letter on this action. As the letter made clear, “NEPA’s foundational premise is that full governmental transparency must be coupled with robust public participation to ensure federal agencies fully inform the public, and that agencies, in turn, are fully informed by the public, of a proposed project’s social and environmental costs and benefits.”

Secretary Burgum announced in April that the Interior Department would cap the review period for certain energy leasing applications, including those for oil, gas, coal, and uranium, at less than one month. Apparently, the first project to be fast-tracked will be the reopening of a uranium mine in Utah closed in 1984. Agriculture Secretary Rollins has announced similar plans to truncate NEPA review for federal timber sales. Uranium mining and clear-cutting national forests are exactly the kinds of activities that may provide short-term windfalls to private companies, while leaving local communities with devastating long-term impacts. Projects like these require more deliberation, not less.

“Red tape” is a red herring

One good way to watch tennis is to keep your eye on the ball. “Cutting red tape” or “streamlining” usually means cutting corners and cutting the public out. Deliberation and public participation are central to the NEPA process and any change to the statue or its implementation designed to “speed things up” often come at the expense of these fundamental goals.

NEPA was considered progressive in 1970, but its authors could not have known just how visionary the law really was. There is no better planning tool for coordinating a federal response to the climate crisis, or redressing decades of environmental racism, than NEPA. The goal of productive harmony between people and nature still seems both worthy and remote, particularly as millions of people suffer through yet another climate-fueled Danger Season.

The Trump Administration plan to destroy NEPA is dangerously wrong. Federal agencies need better funding, staffing, and training to engage in NEPA work more effectively; new short-cuts, time-limits, exemptions, or statutes of limitations are not in the public interest.

All infrastructure and energy development in the US since 1970 has occurred pursuant to NEPA. The law is not a barrier to development; it is a shield against reckless and unjust federal action. The only entities who benefit from undermining NEPA are special interests who reap a short-term windfall when federal agencies leap before they look. The only reason to curtail NEPA would be to let those windfalls happen.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blog-Thumbnail-deforestation.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:34.241745

John Curtis, R-Utah, hinted at changes to the Republican-led tax package, particularly on provisions repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration.
Those provisions have divided Republicans as some have warned against repealing certain credits that boost energy production.
“It very clearly is a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just of clean energy, but of energy” in general, Curtis told the Deseret News at a press conference in Erda, Tooele County, with Fluence, a clean energy company.
While the House-passed budget framework “dramatically curtailed” many of those green energy tax credits, Curtis said there is a desire among some GOP lawmakers to preserve a handful of incentives in the final text.
The Senate will begin consideration next week on the Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s budget framework advancing policies on border, energy, national defense and tax reform.","Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, hinted at changes to the Republican-led tax package, particularly on provisions repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration.

In the budget resolution passed last week, which seeks to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda on a slew of issues, Republicans approved language to repeal or phase out a number of green energy tax credits previously approved in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those provisions have divided Republicans as some have warned against repealing certain credits that boost energy production.

Curtis returned to Utah this week to expand on that message.

“It very clearly is a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just of clean energy, but of energy” in general, Curtis told the Deseret News at a press conference in Erda, Tooele County, with Fluence, a clean energy company.

While the House-passed budget framework “dramatically curtailed” many of those green energy tax credits, Curtis said there is a desire among some GOP lawmakers to preserve a handful of incentives in the final text.

“My friends in the House kind of called me up to say, ‘Listen, we’re counting on you to fix it,’” Curtis said. “So I think even many of them knew that what they sent over did need some work, and that’s now our job in the Senate to put our stamp on that and have it speak for our will.”

“And I think if I have anything to say about it,” he added, “I’ll make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future.”

The budget proposal, coined as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” would repeal many of the tax credits aimed toward incentivizing businesses to utilize clean energy to address the effects of climate change. That language was tucked into the larger framework by Republicans who lamented that the Inflation Reduction Act was drafted and passed solely by Democrats, demanding it be fully repealed to pave the way for their own party’s agenda.

However, some Republicans have cautioned against a full repeal of Biden’s signature climate bill, warning it could lead to “significant disruptions” and weaken the United States on the global stage.

A group of GOP senators, including Curtis, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., last month to consider “each existing tax credit” for its ability to spur domestic manufacturing, reduce utility costs, and ensure businesses receive “meaningful U.S. investments” based on the current tax structure.

By doing that, they argued, beneficial credits can be protected while cutting costly programs that don’t have substantial support.

Curtis said conversations are ongoing about how to address the clean energy credits, noting many of his GOP colleagues “don’t like it because we weren’t included in it (and) we didn’t get a chance to vote for it.”

But he argued the Inflation Reduction Act contains “a lot of Utah/Republican/conservative principles … that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on.”

Those decisions, he argued, are crucial to Trump’s desire to be energy dominant.

The Senate will begin consideration next week on the Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s budget framework advancing policies on border, energy, national defense and tax reform. Republican leaders hope to pass the megabill and have it signed by Trump before the Fourth of July.

However, if changes are made in the Senate, it will need to be passed by the House again — which could be easier said than done if any language is stripped out.",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/PL6NAPRZANFGXBBRCKCLUQPEP4.JPG?focal=0%2C0&auth=aec21a907b68f30edad3708cfdf736c4d50056ab45a721ec5390ac75fedd27fd&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-05-28 11:09:58.718785

Indigenous rights NGO Survival International said that was Jakarta’s first acknowledgement of uncontacted, or “isolated”, Hongana Manyawa in the area.
Inside the jungle, a similar story is playing out, said Hongana Manyawa member Ngigoro, who emerged from the uncontacted as a child.","Sitting deep in east Indonesia’s lush jungle, Bokum, one of the country’s last isolated hunter-gatherers, has a simple message for the nickel miners threatening his home: “This is our land.”

He belongs to the Hongana Manyawa Indigenous tribe, which includes around 3,000 “contacted” members like him, and another 500 who reject contact with the modern world.

Their home on Halmahera Island was once a breathtaking kaleidoscope of nature that provided sanctuary and sustenance.

But it is being eaten away by the world’s largest nickel mine, as Indonesia exploits vast reserves of the metal used in everything from electric vehicles to stainless steel.

“I’m worried if they keep destroying the forest,” Bokum told AFP in a clearing in central Halmahera.

“We have no idea how to survive without our home and food.”

The plight of the Hongana Manyawa, or “People of the Forest”, started gaining attention in Indonesia last year after a video widely shared on Facebook showed emaciated, uncontacted members emerging from their rapidly changing forest home to beg for food.

But the remote region — about 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometres) from capital Jakarta — mostly remains far from the public consciousness.

AFP travelled into the Halmahera jungle to see how the sprawling Weda Bay Nickel concession has affected the once-pristine tribal lands that the Hongana Manyawa call home.

During a three-day, 36-kilometre (22-mile) trek across parts of the 45,000-hectare concession, the mining operation’s impacts were starkly clear.

Booms from controlled explosions to expose nickel shook birds from trees, while helicopters buzzing overhead shared the skies with green parrots, Moluccan owls, hornbills and giant bees.

Tree stumps provided evidence of logging, and off-duty mine guards were seen hunting tropical birds with air guns.

Throughout the night, the sound of excavators scratching the topsoil penetrated the thick vegetation, competing with frog calls and the drone of insects.

Mud that locals say is stirred up by mining has stained rivers copper, and the water leaves skin irritated.

In 22 river crossings, only a few fish were visible. Tribe members say they have mostly disappeared.

AFP did not seek to meet uncontacted Hongana Manyawa.

Bokum emerged from isolation earlier in his life, but still has very limited contact with the outside world.

He and his wife Nawate agreed to meet AFP around 45 minutes from his home deeper in the jungle.

But he could not stay long: en route, he spotted miners and wanted to return to ward them off.

“The company workers have been trying to map our territory,” he told AFP, wearing a black cowboy hat, shirt and rolled-up jeans.

“It’s our home and we will not give it to them.”

– ‘Prevent their annihilation’ –

Indonesia’s constitution enshrines Indigenous land rights, and a 2013 Constitutional Court ruling promised to give local communities greater control of their customary forests .

But environmental groups say the law is not well enforced.

With no land titles, the Hongana Manyawa have little chance of asserting their claims to stewardship of forest that overlaps with Weda Bay’s concession.

According to Weda Bay Nickel (WBN), its mine on Indonesia’s Maluku islands accounted for 17 percent of global nickel production in 2023, making it the largest in the world.

WBN is a joint venture of Indonesia’s Antam and Singapore-based Strand Minerals, with shares divided between French mining giant Eramet and Chinese steel major Tsingshan.

WBN told AFP it is “committed to responsible mining and protecting the environment”, and trains employees to “respect local customs and traditions”.

It said there is “no evidence that uncontacted or isolated groups are being impacted by WBN’s operations”.

Eramet told AFP it has requested permission from WBN’s majority shareholders for an independent review of “engagement protocols” with Hongana Manyawa, expected this year.

Further review of how the tribe uses the area’s forests and rivers is also underway, it added, though it said there was currently “no evidence” of members living in isolation in its concession.

The Indonesian government, which acknowledges most of the concession was previously protected forest, told AFP otherwise.

There is “recognition of evidence of the existence of isolated tribes around Weda Bay”, said the directorate general of coal and minerals at Indonesia’s energy ministry.

It said it was committed to “protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples and ensuring that mining activities do not damage their lives and environment”.

Indigenous rights NGO Survival International said that was Jakarta’s first acknowledgement of uncontacted, or “isolated”, Hongana Manyawa in the area.

It called the admission a “hammer blow” to Eramet’s claims and said a no-go area to protect the tribe was “the only way to prevent their annihilation”.

Both WBN and Eramet said they work to minimise impact on the environment. Eramet’s new CEO will be in Indonesia this week, seeking permission to expand the mine’s capacity.

Tsingshan and Antam did not respond to AFP requests for comment.

Bokum said mining has driven away the wild pigs, deer and fish he once caught for food. Now, he looks for shrimp and frogs in less-affected smaller streams.

“Since the company destroyed our home, our forest, we’ve been struggling to hunt, to find clean water,” he said in the Indigenous Tobelo language.

“If they keep destroying our forest we cannot drink clean water again.”

– ‘Go away’ –

Nickel is central to Indonesia’s growth strategy. It banned ore exports in 2020 to capture more of the value chain.

The country is both the world’s largest producer, and home to the biggest-known reserves.

Mining — dominated by coal and nickel — represented nearly nine percent of its GDP in the first quarter of 2025, government data shows.

Nickel mined in the Halmahera concession is processed at the Weda Bay Industrial Park.

Since operations began in 2019, the area has transformed rapidly, into what some call a “Wild West”.

At a checkpoint near the industrial park, men stopped AFP to demand cash and forced their vehicle to move elsewhere, before a local government official intervened.

The towns on the mine edge — Lelilef Sawai, Gemaf and Sagea — form a chaotic frontier.

Employees in hard hats crisscross muddy roads that back up with rush-hour traffic.

Shops catering to labourers line the roadside, along with prostitutes looking for business in front of bed bug-infested hostels.

The mining workforce has more than doubled since 2020 to nearly 30,000 people.

Locals say these are mostly outsiders whose arrival has sparked tensions and coincided with rising cases of respiratory illness and HIV/AIDS.

Smelter towers belch a manmade cloud visible from kilometres away.

“Mining companies have not implemented good practices, have violated human rights and there is rarely any evaluation,” said Adlun Fiqri, spokesman for the Save Sagea campaign group.

Inside the jungle, a similar story is playing out, said Hongana Manyawa member Ngigoro, who emerged from the uncontacted as a child.

“Long before the mining, it was really quiet and good to live in the forest,” said the 62-year-old, as he marked his route by slicing pock-marks into trees with his machete.

He remains at ease in the forest, using reeds for shade and bamboo shoots to boil water.

“There was no destruction. They were not afraid of anything,” he said.

He climbed nimbly down a steep slope by clinging to tree roots before crossing a riverbed peppered with garnierite — green nickel ore.

“This land belongs to the Hongana Manyawa,” he said.

“They existed living in the rainforest before even the state existed. So go away.”

That sentiment echoes elsewhere on Halmahera.

At least 11 Indigenous people were recently arrested for protesting mining activity in the island’s east, Amnesty International said Monday.

– ‘We will not give our consent’ –

Despite their “contacted” status, Bokum and Nawate have rarely met outsiders.

They approached haltingly, with Nawate refusing to speak at all, instead surveying her visitors with a cautious smile.

Bokum described moving at least six times to outrun encroaching miners.

NGOs fear the mine operation risks wiping out the tribe.

“They rely entirely on what nature provides for them to survive and as their rainforest is being devastated so too are they,” said Callum Russell, Asia research and advocacy officer at Survival International.

“Any contact with workers in the forest runs the risk of exposing them to deadly diseases to which they have little to no immunity.”

The government told AFP it has “conducted documentation” to understand isolated tribes near Weda Bay, and involved them “in the decision-making process”.

Activists say this is impossible given most of the group do not use modern technology and limit contact with outsiders.

Amid growing scrutiny, there have been rumblings of support for the tribe, including from some senior politicians.

Tesla, which has signed deals to invest in Indonesian nickel, has mooted no-go zones to protect Indigenous peoples.

And Swedish EV company Polestar last year said it would seek to avoid compromising “uncontacted tribes” in its supply chain.

For Bokum however, the problem is already on his doorstep.

A 2.5-kilometre-long (1.5 miles) open pit lies just over the hill from a plot where he grows pineapple and cassava.

Bokum and Nawate received mobile phones from mine workers — in an unsuccessful attempt to convince them to approve mining operations.

They and other tribe members use numerical codes to identify contacts and make calls.

They must approach the concession to pick up signal, but when mine workers near his home, Bokum wields his machete to scare them off.

“This is our land. Our home,” he said.

“We will not give our consent to destroy it.”

By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says.
Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change.
Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world.
For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","The fastest-growing car brand in the U.K. is BYD, the Chinese automaker behind electric cars like the new £16,000 ($21,600) Surf. Last month, the brand outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time.

BYD is also the fastest-growing car brand in Brazil, where EV sales jumped up 85% last year. In the capital city of Brasilia, BYD now outsells all other cars, whether they’re gas or electric. In Nepal, where seven out of every 10 cars imported last year was an EV, BYD’s electric models vie with those from Tata, an Indian brand. In Thailand, another Chinese company called Changan is quickly gaining market share with its electric cars.

The world is going electric: The International Energy Agency recently projected that one in four cars sold this year will be an EV. But the U.S. is lagging behind, and the Trump administration’s assault on EVs will slow down the industry more. That doesn’t bode well for the future of American automakers.

“Probably the most dire scenario is that the U.S. becomes somewhat isolated in an idiosyncratic market, with lots of big pickups and SUVs that don’t sell in any other market, and that are still predominantly fossil fuel,” says John Paul MacDuffie, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “And we’re not exposed to competition from some of the new manufacturers or some of the new technologies—not only electric but autonomous and connected.”

China already had a long head start

Even before Trump—who has said that Biden’s support for EVs was a “Marxist hoax”—American car companies were behind their Chinese counterparts on the path to electrification. One factor was China’s continuous support, which started more than 15 years ago. “There were changes to the policy and subsidies, but generally it [was clear] that the government thinks this is good technology,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank. “So if you’re going to buy an electric vehicle, it’s not like in two years things are going to change dramatically.”

Before China started pouring billions into the sector and made EV competitiveness a national priority, BYD was already innovative and lobbying for government support. The company, which had been founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer, was “entrepreneurial and ready to take up the challenge,” Mazzocco says.

Electric cars also got early support in the U.S.—Tesla got a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy in 2009, benefitted from EV tax credits for consumers, and got a major boost from California’s zero-emission vehicle credits. But China’s support went farther and faster. Around 60% of new car models sold in China are now electric, five times more than what’s available in the U.S., according to the IEA.

From the beginning, Chinese automakers were laser-focused on the cost of EVs. By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says. In many cases, the technology is more advanced than EV tech from some Western automakers, as Chinese companies race to improve batteries and software.

Chinese companies are 30% faster than legacy automakers at developing new EV models, according to one analysis. Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted last year that he’d been driving an electric car from Xiaomi—a Chinese smartphone manufacturer that started making EVs—and said he “doesn’t want to give it up.”

“There’s no doubt” the future is electric

Still, American automakers know that their future is electric. “There’s no doubt about it,” says Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, the former chief economist at Ford. Companies have already spent billions on the transition. But right now, the legacy automakers face cost challenges. Engineering new batteries and new vehicles obviously has a steep capital cost, versus the depreciated capital costs for continuing to make internal combustion engine cars. And although EV sales grew faster last year than gas car sales, they aren’t growing as quickly as automakers hoped.

“I’ve done the math,” Hughes-Cromwick says. “It’s not great right now for our domestic manufacturers, because they’ve got low volume but high fixed costs on the new technology, and low capital costs and high volume on the old tech.”

As more EVs sell, companies can get to cost and pricing parity. Policies could help make the transition easier, she says, such as keeping tax credits in place for EVs. Instead, the federal government is pushing hard in the other direction.

Trump froze billions in spending on EV charging infrastructure, and blocked subsidies for factories making batteries, despite the fact that those factories were creating American jobs. Congress is trying to get rid of the consumer tax credit and add a new annual fee for EV owners (though the fee is meant to replace the gas tax, the total cost would be higher than drivers with gas cars currently spend on it). Congress is also trying to block California’s plans to transition to zero-emissions vehicles. Tariffs have added to the economic pressure.

Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change. “The time horizon for product cycles, facility planning, and supply chain planning is very long,” says MacDuffie. “They’re global companies, so they’re not just planning for the U.S. market. I have been predicting that U.S. companies will continues to pursue a long-term strategy which is premised on electrification hitting most markets and most products. I think it would take years of a hostile economic and policy environment for them to back away from that in a big way.”

It’s too early to count out American automakers, Hughes-Cromwick says, noting that they could pull forward on software, for example. But as Trump pushes for anti-EV policy, companies are slowing some electric investments, and are likely to keep falling behind as Chinese companies race forward. A year ago, the IEA predicted that EVs would hit 50% of car sales in the U.S. by 2030; the agency has now revised that to 20%.

With steep tariffs keeping cheap Chinese EVs out of the U.S., there’s less incentive for American automakers to innovate as quickly on electric vehicles. The current tax bill also reduces support for EV battery makers and slashes funding for research and development of new battery tech through the Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world. Last year, BYD surpassed Tesla in global vehicle sales. BYD’s stock price has climbed around 59% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since the beginning of 2025, while Tesla’s has declined around 11% on the Nasdaq, despite some recovery in recent weeks. In Brazil, BYD is now rebuilding a former Ford factory, on a street that a local politician wants to rename from Henry Ford Avenue to BYD Avenue.

“Once consumers have access to these vehicles, they’re really interested,” says Mazzocco. For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91341030-us-lagging-on-evs.jpg",N,,2025-05-28 07:04:05.959566

This time of year reminds us that while one season ends, another begins. Although the 2025 Regular Session concluded in March, back in Frankfort, the work on behalf of Kentuckians does not pause. The way the legislature proceeds will look quite different.

Since adjourning the session, it has been a particularly busy time in the district—from graduations, to agriculture events, to groundbreakings, from finalizing long-awaited projects to celebrating new investments in our district. Several notable events occurred across the district over the past month, including two exciting ribbon cuttings, spotlighting the value of local partnerships and public investment in our schools.

At Cannonsburg Elementary, students, educators, families, and local leaders gathered to celebrate the reopening of the school following a two-year, $11.8 million renovation. With expanded classrooms, a new cafeteria and library, upgraded safety infrastructure, and long-overdue facility improvements, this project marks a significant step forward for education in the region. The majority of the funding—over $7 million—was awarded through state investment, reinforcing the importance of our shared commitment to public education. When students took the stage to thank us, it was a powerful reminder of why this work matters.

That same day, I joined community leaders at Boyd County High School for the ribbon cutting of the new Career and Technical Center, which is another critical investment in our region’s future. This facility will offer students hands-on training and career preparation in a range of fields, equipping them with the tools they need to pursue opportunities right here at home. I was proud to support this project alongside Boyd County Schools and local government partners. Together, these efforts reflect our determination to invest in infrastructure that uplifts students, strengthens families, and builds the foundation for long-term economic growth throughout the district.

Looking toward June, legislators will soon return to Frankfort as we enter what is known as the Interim Joint Session. This phase of the legislative calendar is not a break from duty. It is a period of deeper focus before the next session commences. This is when lawmakers review past legislation, examine pressing issues, and study the policy decisions that shape everyday life across the Commonwealth.

For me, this interim is a time to listen, ask better questions, and prepare. With a 60-day budget session on the horizon in 2026, the work we do over the next several months will influence how we invest in education, health care, public safety, and rural economic opportunity. This is where the foundation is built. I plan to take an active role in that process.

During the regular session, the General Assembly debates and votes on bills. The pace is fast and decisions move quickly. The interim slows that pace down. It gives us time to look closely at the effects of laws already passed and to gather information about the challenges ahead.

Interim committees meet jointly with members of both the House and Senate. They hear from experts, review data, and consider testimony from Kentuckians affected by state policy. This is when ideas are refined. This is when better policy begins to take shape.

I serve on five Interim Joint Committees. These are not ceremonial roles. Each committee meets regularly to consider real issues that affect families, workers, and communities across the Commonwealth. Below is a summary of the work ahead.

Interim Joint Committee on Agriculture

In our part of the state, agriculture is more than a job. It is a way of life. This committee focuses on farm safety, conservation programs, food systems, and rural economic development. We also review policies involving crop insurance, disease control, and livestock health. I will be watching closely how recent changes in funding affect access to grants and loans that support small and family-owned farms. This includes attention to the administration of the Tobacco Master Settlement funds and the role of the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy. Rural prosperity begins with smart investment in agriculture, and I will continue to advocate for that.

Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue

This committee reviews how Kentucky raises and spends public dollars. We examine budget forecasts, tax structures, and state investments in infrastructure, education, and health services. Every policy depends on how the budget is constructed. This interim will be critical in shaping the next biennial budget. I will continue pushing for equitable funding across regions and fairness in state resource distribution. The needs of rural communities deserve full consideration.

Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary

The justice system involves real people and serious decisions. This subcommittee reviews funding for the courts, public defenders, corrections, and law enforcement. I will focus on access to justice in rural areas. That includes ensuring our courthouses are funded, our victims are supported, and our mental health services for justice-involved individuals are not overlooked. Budgeting for justice requires more than numbers. It requires a commitment to fairness and dignity.

Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children

This committee focuses on services that help Kentuckians meet their basic needs. That includes support for children and adults in crisis, nutrition programs, foster care, and child protection. These services are essential in rural areas where access can be limited by geography, staffing shortages, or weak infrastructure. I will work to ensure federal dollars are used effectively and that state policies meet the real-world needs of families in my district.

Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy

Kentucky’s future depends on responsible management of our natural resources. This committee reviews issues tied to water systems, utilities, environmental protections, and energy development. I continue to support a balanced approach. We must protect our land and water while also recognizing the role of energy and natural resource jobs. Flood mitigation and water infrastructure investment will be key issues in this interim. I will be a strong voice for smarter, forward-looking policy in these areas.

In addition to interim joint committees, I serve on several statutory committees established under Kentucky law or authorized as permanent subcommittees of the Legislative Research Commission. These committees meet regularly to review complex financial, infrastructure, and agricultural matters. Their proceedings are open to the public and the press.

Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee

This committee is tasked with reviewing how state dollars are spent on capital construction and public infrastructure. That includes oversight of emergency repair accounts, the leasing or purchase of state-owned properties, and bond issuances for both state government and local school districts. I will continue to monitor how capital investments are allocated and whether they are serving the long-term needs of our communities.

2026–2028 Budget Preparation and Submission Committee

As Kentucky prepares for the biennial budget, this committee plays an important role in setting the framework for how agencies draft and submit their spending plans. The committee provides guidance on budget instructions, formats, and requirements, ensuring consistency and accountability across government. This work will help shape the foundation of the 2026 budget session, and I intend to approach it with the seriousness it deserves.

Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee

This committee reviews the use of Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds, with a focus on agricultural development, public health, and early childhood investments. We evaluate grants and loans issued by the Agricultural Development Board and examine how those resources are being used to diversify farm income, support rural communities, and advance long-term planning for Kentucky agriculture. I remain committed to preserving the original intent of these funds and ensuring they reach the people and programs they were designed to help.

The legislative process works best when people are involved. Interim Joint Committee meetings are open to the public. They are also streamed online and archived for review. Anyone can watch, read, or participate.

Over the next few months, these issues will be a focus, and listening to constituents to hear what is working and what is not, is vital to how we move forward on them. That feedback shapes how I serve. Being a public servant means showing up, following through, and carrying local voices into every conversation in Frankfort. Whether we are talking about roads, rivers, classrooms, or courtrooms, the goal is good policies that serve the people where they live.

The interim session may not make the headlines, but it is where thoughtful work begins. I look forward to continuing that work with care and with the same commitment I brought to the regular session.

The Mountain and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub, or MAP EJ Grants Hub, planned to distribute $40 million funding throughout EPA Region 8.","A climate resilience center in southwest Denver. A tree-planting project along Interstate 70. A constellation of urban gardens.

Those are just some of the Colorado projects on life support after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated federal grants to support environmental justice programs.

Since President Trump returned to office, his administration has targeted federal support for initiatives seeking to address the disproportionate impact of toxic pollution and climate change in less-white and less-affluent communities. Multiple studies have linked concentrated environmental impacts to poor health outcomes.

The approach marks a swift reversal from the Biden administration, which made rectifying environmental inequality a core piece of its climate strategy. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for example, earmarked nearly $3 billion to support environmental justice projects and established an environmental justice office within the EPA to distribute the funding.

Those federal grants began arriving in Colorado in late 2024. KC Becker, who oversaw the Mountain West region as the former EPA Region 8 administrator, said her team recognized political support for environmental justice would likely evaporate under a future Trump administration.

“We knew the grants were at risk, and we worked to finalize as much as we could,” Becker said.

Turns out Becker was right to worry. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has called environmental justice “an excuse to fund left-wing activists” rather than fix actual environmental issues. Besides putting all employees within its environmental justice office on leave, the EPA is now seeking to cancel 781 grants meant to bolster clean energy and environmental projects, according to an April court filing. Almost all of the impacted grant programs focus on environmental justice.

It’s unclear how many of those grants would fund projects in Colorado or the Mountain West. A separate list released by several Democratic senators in March identified 13 Colorado-based environmental justice grants targeted for termination, which would have sent nearly $25 million to communities, nonprofits and tribal nations.

Cyrus Western, the new EPA Region 8 administrator, said in a written statement that the agency has vetted grants to determine if they’re an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and align with Trump administration priorities. “Grants that do not support the Administration’s agenda have been terminated,” Western said.

Here are some examples of community and nonprofit projects grappling with uncertainty due to grant terminations or federal funding freezes. A spokesperson with EPA Region 8 confirmed it has terminated funding for each project listed below.

A new climate resilience center in southwest Denver

Organization: Commún

Total grant: $20,000,000

A week before President Trump’s second inauguration, Commún, a Denver-based nonprofit, received a $20,000,000 EPA grant to establish a resilience and community center in southwest Denver.

The center would usually serve as a gathering space in the heart of the Loeretto Heights campus, a former Catholic boarding school, developers are now reshaping into a neighborhood and culture hub. The project would transform Machebeuf Hall, a former cafeteria and student union built in the 1950s, into a multipurpose facility with a grocery store, food stalls, a mental health center and a laundry facility.

It was also meant to serve as a disaster refuge in moments of crisis. In the event of a grid failure, for example, backup batteries and solar panels would help keep the center’s lights on. Air filtration would also help protect occupants from wildfire smoke or other air pollution threats.

Margaret Brugger, the executive director of Commún, said the grant would have allowed her group to start construction in March. It put those plans on hold after the EPA froze the grant shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, and the group received a termination letter ending the grant funding in mid-May. The nonprofit is now working to appeal the decision and exploring ways to move forward with pieces of the estimated $30 million project.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing, but I will always keep hope,” Brugger said.

Trees and shrubs along Interstate 70 in Globeville

Organization: National Wildlife Federation and the Green Dot Coalition

Total grant: $500,000

In 2023, the National Wildlife Federation won a $500,000 EPA environmental justice grant to plant trees and vegetation along Interstate 70 in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood, an area with well-documented air pollution issues compounded by traffic and major factories.

The nonprofit applied for the grant in partnership with Green Dot Coalition, a far smaller organization working to establish green spaces in historically disadvantaged urban communities. The project aims to improve barren concrete planters lining 10 blocks on either side of the highway.

On a recent visit, Jevon Taylor, the executive director of Green Dot Coalition, said almost all vegetation died more than a decade ago due to neglect and a faulty irrigation system. The only exception is a single tree clinging to the edge of one planter, which he said local residents don’t want cut down.

“It represents the neighborhood. It represents Globeville and Elyria and how resilient they are,” Taylor said.

The National Wildlife Federation said the EPA terminated its grant at the end of March. Before then, Taylor said his group managed to spend $175,000 to pay an irrigation contractor and secure supplies. As a result, it will proceed with plans to paint a mural and plant containers on one side of the highway this summer. He’s not sure if or when the group can proceed with plans to improve the north side of the highway.

Fruit trees and vegetable gardens in west Denver

Organization: Denver Urban Gardens

Total grant: $500,000

Denver Urban Gardens received a $500,000 EPA grant in November 2023. It also received an additional $350,000 through a United States Department of Agriculture project to support urban agriculture projects and innovation around the same time.

Linda Appel Lipsius, the nonprofit’s executive director, said the funding would have helped her group install six new community gardens and nine “food forests” in west Denver. She said those projects would have supported issues identified by a recent city planning initiative, which found the area lacks grocery stores and green infrastructure to guard against rising urban temperatures.

Lipsisus said since President Trump took office, the federal government has terminated access to both awards. Denver Urban Gardens is now only moving forward with two gardens and up to four or five food forests.

“It’s just heartbreaking,” Appel Lipsius said. “It just seems like this is such simple, straightforward, foundational, apolitical work, and that this is getting caught up in all this just feels confusing and misguided.""

A major hub for future grants

Organization: Mountains and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub

Total grant: $48 million

Beside cutting off access to previously awarded grants, the EPA has also ended funding for another program designed to help rural governments and small organizations access federal resources.

In February, the Trump administration terminated $177 million in federal funding for technical assistance centers to help rural communities and tribal nations apply for federal funding. The cut ended a $10 million center at Montana State University to assist rural communities and tribal nations in the Mountain West.

Then, in early May, the EPA also terminated its companion initiative: the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, a $600 million initiative to hand out small grants worth up to $350,000 through 11 regional hubs around the country. The Mountain and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub, or MAP EJ Grants Hub, planned to distribute $40 million funding throughout EPA Region 8.

The Biden administration selected JSI Research and Training Institute, a Denver-based public health and education nonprofit, to operate the MAP EJ Grants Hub.

Alexandra Witonsky joined as a grant manager for the new program in August 2024. In an interview with CPR News, she said the initiative had committed about $20 million to fund 96 projects before the Trump administration terminated its funding in early May. She also lost her position with JSI following the funding cuts.

Michelle Gabrieloff-Parish leads FLOWS, a Boulder-based climate justice group that earned $250,000 from the MAP EJ Grants Hub, but the funding wasn’t finalized before the Trump administration terminated the program.

Gabrieloff-Parish said the grant would have supported projects to replace turf with native plants at affordable housing projects and help a mobile home community fight for clean drinking water. If the Biden administration was serious about environmental justice, she said it should have distributed the funding faster.

“These funds were always meant to support frontline communities. We were just last in line, we got them last, and they got cut,” Gabrieloff-Parish said.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky?
Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars.
The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency.","A sudden blackout across Spain and Portugal earlier this month left 50 million people without electricity. While the cause of the outage is unclear, a leading culprit appears to be poorly integrated wind and solar resources. What’s clear is that, in an increasingly digital age, ensuring affordable and reliable power is more critical than ever.

The Spain-Portugal blackout came as U.S. power regulation authorities sounded an alarm about the safety of America’s electric grid and power supply. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky? And could Spain’s massive blackout happen here?

Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars. And when Americans crank up their air conditioners amid scorching summer heat, regional utilities must meet that hefty additional demand.

The problem is that there might not be enough electricity to go around.

The United States is suddenly using a lot more electricity than before. Electric vehicles, new manufacturing plants, and an exponentially growing array of data centers — which support the digital needs of cell phones, web browsers and AI systems — are gobbling up power. Power demand is growing so fast that, in the past year, NERC found America’s peak electricity needs grew by a staggering 10 gigawatts. That’s more than double the growth seen between 2023 and 2024.

Surging demand is also colliding with the remnants of a regulatory agenda that aimed to wipe out America’s coal power plant fleet and make it impossible to build coal and natural gas power plants. While the Trump administration has worked to undo this misguided regulatory blitz, grid operators have lost essential dispatchable power plants that work on demand. They’re now increasingly reliant on renewable power systems subject to the weather’s whims.

Because of this, NERC says that grid operators “face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

The greatest threat to grids nationwide will be heat waves when demand spikes. Windless, scorching summer days — and evenings when solar power disappears — could leave grids alarmingly short of supply.

The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie has observed that America is now “losing dispatchable generation at a pace that is not sustainable, and we are not adding sufficient equivalent generation capacity.”

Evan Halper and Maxine Joselow report for The Washington Post.

In short:

The proposed tax bill would eliminate $522 billion in clean energy subsidies established under the Inflation Reduction Act, jeopardizing projects in states like North Carolina and Texas that have seen massive investments.

Republican senators are facing pressure as these subsidies have created thousands of jobs and attracted major infrastructure investments in their home states.

Analysts warn that repealing the incentives would not only damage local economies but also raise household electricity bills and weaken U.S. competitiveness in global energy and AI markets.

Key quote:

“If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

— Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association

Why this matters:

The fight over clean energy subsidies is about more than politics. These incentives have transformed America’s energy landscape, pumping money and jobs into regions once dominated by fossil fuels. In places like North Carolina, billions in private investment have flowed toward building battery factories and solar infrastructure, offering stable employment and diversifying local economies. But with the proposed rollback of these programs, many of these projects face collapse, and the U.S. risks falling behind in the global race for clean energy dominance. Fossil fuel development alone won’t meet the rising demand for electricity driven by AI, electrified transportation, and data infrastructure. Experts warn that eliminating subsidies could stymie innovation, raise utility costs, and leave the power grid more vulnerable to disruption. For many small business owners, the uncertainty could derail growth plans and trigger layoffs, raising concerns about long-term economic resilience and environmental stability.

Any 30 senators can force a CRA resolution onto the floor, with a required ten hours of debate time.
This means that Democrats can tie up the Senate floor for upwards of ten hours with any single CRA resolution.
Importantly, Senate Democrats already know this.
And given the high stakes of the budget bill—soaring inequality as benefits for the poor are slashed to finance tax cuts for the rich—every tool at Senate Democrats’ disposal should be employed.","It’s refreshing in a way that we no longer have to spend much time thinking about the Senate parliamentarian, the shadowy figure whose rulings supposedly decide what the chamber can and cannot do. Republicans put that to bed last week by overruling the parliamentarian over whether a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution could nullify the Environmental Protection Agency’s waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards on vehicles.

California was given authority in a carve-out to the Clean Air Act in 1970 to set higher emissions standards than the national rules, with the EPA subsequently granting waivers more than 100 times. The state was prepared to use its latest waiver to effectively ban gas-powered auto sales by 2035. But the Senate voted 51-to-44 last week to cancel that waiver, as well as two other waivers to tighten emission rules on diesel trucks and allow zero-emission trucks on the road. The House had already voted for the resolution, so it can now be signed by President Trump.

Only executive branch agency rules can be overturned by a CRA resolution, and only within 60 legislative days after being presented to Congress, in an up-or-down vote that avoids the Senate filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian, joining the auditors at the Government Accountability Office, said that the EPA waivers were not “rules” as defined by the CRA, and therefore couldn’t be put into a resolution. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), in a communication he sent last Congress about these very EPA waivers, agreed that the “federal preemption waivers cannot be reviewed under the Congressional Review Act.”

Yet Senate Republicans said, “Tough, we’re doing it anyway.” And Lee voted with them.

More from David Dayen

California has already announced that it will sue to maintain its waiver, charging that the Senate had no authority to overturn it. But the Senate operates largely on precedent, and now that the parliamentarian has been disregarded on this point, virtually any action the executive branch takes could be construed as a rule, and therefore subject to fast-track congressional review.

For this reason, Democrats could subject the Senate to time-consuming resolution votes repeatedly, to such a degree that the Senate would not have time to do anything else for the rest of this session of Congress. In other words, Democrats could respond to the waiver vote by paralyzing the Senate, and stopping the giant Trump tax bill from ever reaching the floor.

Georgia State University assistant professor and former House Oversight Committee staffer Todd Phillips laid this out in a Prospect piece earlier this month. Any 30 senators can force a CRA resolution onto the floor, with a required ten hours of debate time. These resolutions would need the president’s signature, and nearly all of them wouldn’t even get the Republican votes necessary to pass the Senate. But according to Senate procedure, they have to be dealt with if enough senators force them onto the floor. They must be debated and voted upon ahead of other Senate business if brought up for consideration. This means that Democrats can tie up the Senate floor for upwards of ten hours with any single CRA resolution.

Democrats could go back in time to invalidate prior agency actions.

The deregulatory Trump administration isn’t writing a whole lot of rules, limiting the raw material for these kinds of votes. But the Republican vote on EPA waivers just widely expanded the options for a CRA resolution. If the Department of Health and Human Services grants a state waiver for changes to its Medicaid program, or if the U.S. Department of Agriculture does the same for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Democrats could write resolutions to overturn such waivers. If the Federal Communications Commission issues a broadcast license, or the Justice Department approves a merger, or if the Securities and Exchange Commission decides to defer a prosecution in an investor protection case, Senate Democrats could challenge it. If the Department of Defense inks a contract for a new weapons system or any other item for procurement, they could challenge that, too. Any decision to redirect funds, change the terms of grants, or make practically any decision at all could, under the theory just enshrined into the Senate rulebook by Republicans, lead to a CRA resolution and ten hours of debate.

Democrats could also go back in time to invalidate prior agency actions. The structure of the CRA is that the 60-legislative-day clock for disapproving of a rule starts only when it is submitted to Congress. Waivers haven’t typically been submitted under CRA procedures, because they weren’t considered rules. (This is why the EPA waivers were available for a vote, despite the 60-day legislative clock expiring on May 8.) So there are all kinds of other waivers and agency decisions that never got sent to Congress, and therefore could be put up for a CRA resolution.

The bottom line is this: If you found something like 1,000 current or former agency actions—a reasonable number considering all the work executive branch agencies do—you would probably have enough to keep the Senate debating and voting on CRA resolutions through the duration of this Congress.

That means the Senate would never have the ability to take up executive branch or judicial nominations, or legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that recently passed the House. Senate Democrats could put the chamber into permanent gridlock, and thereby save 14 million people from losing their Medicaid coverage, save millions more from loss of SNAP benefits, while also forcing the 2017 Trump tax cuts to expire. That’s the level of hardball that can be played here.

You don’t even have to introduce 1,000 CRA resolutions. Just a handful deployed at strategic moments would get the point across. And the prospect of more could be used by Democrats as leverage to get legislative changes or prevent other legislative harms, particularly in the budget mega-bill.

Importantly, Senate Democrats already know this. In a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) before the EPA waiver vote, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and several others made this very point: “If the current Senate Majority were to open this door, the CRA could be weaponized to retroactively invalidate decades of agency actions, and effectively hijack the Senate floor.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) underscored this after the Senate vote, saying that when Democrats regain control of the Senate, “every agency action that Democrats don’t like—whether it’s a rule or not—will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.” But he’s wrong that Democrats have to wait. As they need the support of only 30 senators, they can force these votes from the minority.

In those ten-hour debates such actions would force, Senate Republicans should be put on the record on whether they agree with Trump’s restructuring of the federal government. If Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decides to change the vaccination schedules recommended for children, Senate Republicans should have to go on the record about whether they agree. Republicans have escaped accountability for these kinds of harmful activities, and by forcing the Senate to weigh such actions, Democrats wouldn’t have to continue to let them off the hook.

I asked Phillips on Monday whether he had gotten any feedback from Democrats in Washington about his idea. He hadn’t. But we know they’re aware of it; they have said it out loud. They could start the campaign any day now.

The sanctity of Senate procedure doesn’t mean much to me. Using a majority vote for killing the EPA waivers certainly erodes the minority veto that is the filibuster. But I’m fine with a Senate majority having more power than the parliamentarian; that’s far more accountable than our current, disjointed reality, and ultimately will be good for Democrats when they return to full control of the government.

The likely outcome of weaponizing the Republican decision and twisting Senate procedure to make the chamber nonfunctional is that it would compel some détente to step away from mutually assured destruction. That would be a better situation than the “filibuster everything” mentality we have today.

And given the high stakes of the budget bill—soaring inequality as benefits for the poor are slashed to finance tax cuts for the rich—every tool at Senate Democrats’ disposal should be employed.

Pacific Energy’s focus on hybridised solar PV assets

The organisation has utilised hybridised renewable energy generation assets, specifically solar-plus-storage, in the country. Indeed, the group recently completed a 61MW project in Western Australia to power a gold mining operation.

Last year, Pacific Energy penned a deal with mining company Gold Fields to deliver a 35MW solar PV power plant at the St Ives mine site, located around 80km south of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia’s Eastern Goldfields region.

The company also secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with Horizon Power, Western Australia’s energy provider, that would see Exmouth run on 80% solar PV-derived renewable energy in the Gascoyne region.

As part of this project, a new hybrid system comprising a 9.6MW solar PV power plant, a 49.6MWh battery energy storage system and a 7MW gas power station would be developed.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pacific-Energy_Tropicana-Renewables-Expansion-Project.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 11:10:02.670489

Some of the announced investments in Kentucky have yet to come to fruition, and without tax credits, companies may pull back.

Companies and clean energy advocates have cautioned lawmakers against the cuts, which they say would complicate efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing and clean energy supply chains.

In Kentucky, more than 11,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic development hang in the balance as Congress considers axing clean energy tax credits approved in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, according to an analysis from Rhodium Group and MIT — threatening a key pillar of what's widely considered the most comprehensive climate legislation in U.S. history.

Dozens of projects are still pending or under construction around the state, from battery manufacturing to solar facilities and more, the analysis found. If Congress decides to slash tax incentives for these industries, the companies behind the incomplete projects could scale back plans for investment.

Modifying or repealing the tax credits “is a huge risk,” said Hannah Hess, an associate director at Rhodium Group who worked on the analysis — and is piling on uncertainty for companies already facing tariffs and other macroeconomic headwinds.

Kentucky has more operational jobs at stake in these projects than almost any other state, according to the analysis, excluding construction jobs. Nearly 2% of Kentucky’s economy was made up of the ""clean investments"" tracked in the analysis in the past year — tied for the largest portion of any state east of the Mississippi River.

In the early hours of May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a version of a bill experts said would cripple or eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The cuts would impact key credits for manufacturers, but also those for consumers looking to buy electric vehicles, heat pumps and more. This could flatten demand for clean technologies, in turn impeding plans for new factories, like those coming to Kentucky.

The bill passed the House by a one-vote margin, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to face further resistance and revision.

Following the vote, Gov. Andy Beshear encouraged the Senate to reverse the House’s cuts to the clean energy tax credits, ""if not for the original reasons that it was passed, but for the fact that it’s really good for our economy.""

Beshear has voiced his support of several large manufacturing projects in Kentucky poised to benefit from federal tax credits, including the $5.8 billion BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County, which is only partially constructed but is expected to offer 5,000 jobs when complete.

Other potentially vulnerable Kentucky projects with outstanding investments include battery manufacturing facilities in Shelbyville and Bowling Green, and another project near Hopkinsville — which had already announced plans to partially scale back its investment in February, citing ""changing market conditions.""

""The credits worked. They worked. And whether you like a green job because it’s better for the environment, or because it provides a really good living for people, it was working,"" Beshear said at a press briefing. ""It was pushing unemployment down, and it was really helping families.""

Republicans divided on clean energy credits

In Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District, an estimated $2.7 billion in outstanding investment is on the line, the analysis found — the most in the state. The district contains the incomplete BlueOval SK project, in addition to some solar developments and the AESC battery project near Bowling Green.

Republican Brett Guthrie represents the district in Congress, and chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed, Guthrie lauded his committee’s efforts to curb what he called ""Green New Deal-style waste,"" and said the proposed legislation would ""reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.""

Guthrie's office did not respond to a request for comment.

In April, a group of companies with major clean energy investments in Kentucky, including Ford Motor Co., Ascend Elements, BrightNight Power and others, wrote a letter to Guthrie ""to emphasize the importance of preserving tax credits that are energizing advanced energy production and manufacturing in our state.""

""We have seen firsthand the benefits that these tax credits are bringing to our communities: providing investment certainty for our manufacturing economy, creating opportunities for our workers, and maintaining our pre-eminent role in providing the energy that powers a dominant American economy,"" the letter said.

Republicans in both chambers of Congress have been divided on various pieces of President Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and policy proposal, including whether to preserve key tax credits for clean energy investments. In the Senate, four Republicans wrote a letter cautioning ""against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.""

A sizeable majority of the clean energy investments that stand to benefit from the embattled IRA tax credits are in Republican congressional districts. Kentucky's five Republican-represented districts have seen nearly $16 billion in planned investment tied to these projects; more than $9 billion has been spent so far, the MIT and Rhodium Group analysis estimates.

""These districts have been awarded billions for economic development projects that provide exactly the energy transition investments needed to advance renewables and storage at a pace that is more in line with national trends,"" Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said in an email. ""These outstanding investment dollars would not only diversify and modernize our energy portfolio, but have the added benefit of bringing on cleaner energy technologies that are proven and available right now.""

In recent years, some Kentucky Republicans have been dubious about the rush of ""green"" investment in the commonwealth. But the thousands of new jobs have been hard to ignore.

Although some projects have faced setbacks or are still in construction, Kentucky has already seen the creation of more than 14,000 clean energy jobs, spanning ""battery manufacturing, automotive, grid infrastructure, critical minerals, and clean energy industries,"" according to the companies' letter to Guthrie.

In some cases, these jobs offer relief to communities that have suffered from a contraction in domestic manufacturing or other industries, like coal mining.

The gargantuan Toyota Motor plant in Georgetown, for one, has announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in electric vehicle manufacturing. As the plant has geared up for the expansion, it has made a point of hiring former coal workers, the area's former state senator previously told The Courier Journal.

The Republican supermajority in Kentucky's state legislature has approved generous incentives for electric vehicle battery manufacturing and other major clean energy investments, even as the party has criticized the federal programs upholding those investments.

Several of the companies with large outstanding investments in Kentucky, including BlueOval SK, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ascend Elements, which has plans to produce materials for battery manufacturing near Hopkinsville, was among the companies calling for sustained federal support, and cited estimates of its project having ""a positive $4.4 billion economic impact on southwest Kentucky over 10 years.""

""We believe it’s critical for the United States to build a domestic critical minerals and lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure in North America,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""Beyond creating jobs in Kentucky, it’s a matter of national security and energy independence.""

Bridging 'the valley of death'

Businesses are facing significant uncertainty in clean tech investments, and there are some indicators in the data around the country.

""Since the IRA was passed, we’ve seen a huge amount, dollar-wise, of companies announcing projects in the vein of these advanced new technologies,"" Hess said. ""In the first quarter of last year, there was $16 billion worth of projects announced that fit into this emerging climate technologies category,"" and billions of dollars more were announced as recently as late 2024.

But in the first quarter of this year, ""that really fell off a cliff,"" she said.

About $79 million was announced nationally — a 99% drop.

""That's the pipeline of how much is going to be invested in the future,"" Hess said. ""It points to, potentially, a big slowdown in these kinds of advanced technologies.""

Many of the projects that stood to benefit from IRA tax credits were relatively cutting-edge, or at least not yet mainstream in the U.S. — battery factories of unprecedented scale, or mass decarbonization of manufacturing in emissions-intensive industries.

These large capital investments were ""de-risked by federal incentives,"" as companies put it in the letter to Guthrie.

""Decarbonizing those processes like aluminum, clean cement, clean steel ... that's a really gnarly thing to figure out how you're going to get reduced emissions from those,"" Hess said.

Incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, now under siege by Congress, included tax credits for ""advanced manufacturing production,"" which applied to components for solar, wind and batteries, in addition to critical minerals. Other credits bolstered grid modernization or energy generation.

These incentives were designed, in part, to help the U.S. clean energy industry compete with China, where costs are far lower. And the U.S. fossil fuel industry has received federal tax breaks for more than a century. In recent years, the coal, petroleum and natural gas industries have collectively benefited from billions of dollars in subsidies, according to accounting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

By offering various subsidies to the clean technology projects, Hess said, the federal government was attempting to bridge what venture capitalists call the ""valley of death"" — the early period of startups or other new business endeavors, before a positive cash flow is achieved.

And the clean energy sector has found some success. U.S. electric vehicle sales have generally increased over time, and last year, renewable energy made up more than 90% of new power capacity in the grid.

Kentuckians have taken part in these trends. Since the beginning of last year, consumers and businesses in the state have spent about $1 billion on electric vehicles, heat pumps, and ""distributed electricity and storage,"" such as rooftop solar systems, according to MIT and Rhodium Group estimates.

Tax credit cuts could also stymy projects eyeing Kentucky, but yet to be announced — like Century Aluminum's planned ""green aluminum"" smelter. The company has described Eastern Kentucky as a preferred location for the smelter, but has not confirmed a site and is considering other states.

If brought to fruition, the project would create 1,000 permanent, union jobs, and would single-handedly double domestic production of primary aluminum, powered primarily by renewable energy. Century has previously praised the IRA's advanced manufacturing production tax credit for its benefits to U.S. aluminum producers.

If the U.S. Senate preserves the House's cuts to such credits, plans set in motion by the previous administration to decarbonize the U.S. economy and create domestic supply chains for EVs, clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing could be further slowed.

""It's really concerning, if you care about climate,"" Hess said, ""to see these kinds of projects kind of circling the drain.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/presto/2022/04/13/PLOU/902cb6b7-b1e3-41a4-a1f5-53eb0cf3ece8-EnvisionGigafactory_1.jpg?crop=4161,2341,x0,y233&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-28 06:02:45.638231

The company intended to build a third manufacturing plant in the U.S., but those plans have been paused for the time being.
The massive Panasonic factory is still expected to bring EV manufacturing costs – and therefore sticker prices – down, so maybe the electronics juggernaut will change its tune if Americans get excited about cheaper electric cars.","Panasonic has been working on the construction of a massive EV battery plant in Kansas since 2022, and after myriad delays in the interim, it could finally be approaching completion. The facility, which will be the largest such plant in the world, could be operational as soon as August, according to one of Panasonic's construction suppliers. The plant will be the company's second U.S.-based manufacturing plant, following one embedded within the Tesla Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, that builds cells and battery packs for the automaker's Cybertruck and Model X vehicles.

The Plant Was Anticipated To Open In March

When the second factory was announced, Panasonic anticipated it would open in March 2025, but several different delays conspired to render that goal unattainable. Speaking to Nikkei Asia, one of Panasonic's construction suppliers called the schedule extremely difficult to meet, in part citing America's more ""relaxed"" approach to work. For example, the unnamed supplier claimed that local construction workers were less likely to work overtime and more likely to point to workplace irregularities as a safety risk. The entity, which is a contractor for Panasonic and not the electronics giant itself, also said that the local workforce was less reliable than anticipated. Furthermore, variable weather proved challenging; the construction site experienced heavy flooding as a result of a severe winter storm, delaying operations further.

In addition to the weather and workforce concerns, Nikkei Asia reported that Panasonic was approaching its U.S. plant with some trepidation due to the volatile economic situation stemming from the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods. Although the batteries coming from the plant itself would be manufactured in Kansas, the machines used to build them come from Japan, which was hit with a 24 percent reciprocal tariff, making import duties on manufacturing implements more expensive. Panasonic has delayed outfitting its factory with those machines until some of the political dust settles; the governments of Japan and the US are still negotiating the terms of the tariff, 14 percent of which has been paused until July per Nikkei.

August 2025 Is The New Goal

The aforementioned construction supplier said that the De Soto, Kansas–based facility was on track for a production start in August, although Panasonic itself wouldn't commit to a specific date. The Japanese company did acknowledge that it expected the plant to begin mass production during the first half of fiscal-year 2026, which would mean before September at the latest. However, once it gets the new factory up and running, Panasonic may take a more conservative approach to American. operations.

The company intended to build a third manufacturing plant in the U.S., but those plans have been paused for the time being. Panasonic's leadership have expressed skepticism about America's EV-friendliness, citing sporadic charging infrastructure investments and slower-than-expected EV adoption among consumers. The massive Panasonic factory is still expected to bring EV manufacturing costs – and therefore sticker prices – down, so maybe the electronics juggernaut will change its tune if Americans get excited about cheaper electric cars.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/panasonic-energy-office-building.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:50.448991

Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?","President Donald Trump wants to boost American manufacturing, a goal that has eluded other presidents in the so-called “post-industrial” era but a laudatory one nonetheless.

However, many of the manufacturing jobs that he and other administration officials talk most prominently about are likely minimum-wage or other low-wage positions. Meanwhile, the “big, beautiful” bill now moving through Congress would likely slow the growth of one fast-growing manufacturing sector where the average annual income is $81,600. Furthermore, those jobs are concentrated in places that voted for Trump in 2024, meaning that some Republican members of Congress are finding themselves in the position of potentially slowing manufacturing growth in their own districts.

What we have here is a conflict between political ideology that is often quite clear and economic realities that are more complicated and don’t fit easily into standard left-right political alignments. Some of this conflict is playing out in Virginia, most notably in Pittsylvania and Pulaski counties. Let’s walk through what’s going on here.

Manufacturing jobs in the United States started falling in 1979, then fell dramatically after 2000 (which coincides with both the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization) and bottomed out in 2010. Since then, their numbers have grown sluggishly, no matter which president or which party was in power. There are lots of factors at play, but generally speaking, many jobs have gone overseas to lower-wage countries and many others have been automated.

Trump’s solution to this 21st-century problem is to bring back a tax most popular in the 19th century: tariffs, or taxes on imports. The theory is that if imported goods cost more, companies will be encouraged to reshore their manufacturing to the United States so they don’t lose customers.

Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple’s iPhones if they’re not manufactured in the United States. This is not the first time those devices — and other consumer technology — have been singled out. Earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared: “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones — that kind of thing is going to come to America.”

If they did, though, that iPhone would cost a whole lot more than it does now. Workers at one assembly plant in China make $244 a month, or $2,928 a year. Let’s assume Apple opened an assembly line in the United States and paid workers at the same rate that I see being advertised for some convenience store employees — $15 an hour. That’s $31,200 a year, or more than 10 times what those China iPhone assemblers are making. It is simply unrealistic to expect American consumers to pay that much more for their cherished phones, and unrealistic to expect Apple shareholders to make do with lower dividends. American consumers demand inexpensive products and American investors demand a return, which is why low-skilled manufacturing has gone overseas and will stay there. The economics just don’t work otherwise. Americans don’t get paid enough money to afford the prices that companies would have to charge if they made their products with American labor.

The manufacturing that can — and is — growing in the United States involves more high-skilled work. Conveniently, we have some — but some of the provisions in the Republican tax bill put those jobs in jeopardy.

The bill sets out to roll back certain tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which was really more of a climate bill than an anti-inflation bill. Both the politics and the economics seem simple: Republicans have never been as keen on renewable energy as Democrats have been, and they want to get rid of those tax credits to make it easier to cut spending elsewhere. Here’s where things get complicated for them and interesting to those of us who follow politics: Those tax credits have created green manufacturing jobs in red states and red districts. The stereotype of an electric vehicle driver might be a Democrat, but those vehicles — and especially their batteries — are being built by Republicans. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Denver-based research firm, the Rhodium Group, found that since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, the U.S. has seen $662 billion invested in clean energy projects, with $115 billion of that in manufacturing. Of that, almost 82% of those projects have been in Republican congressional districts. In terms of jobs, CNBC reports that about 86,700 clean energy manufacturing jobs are in Republican districts, nearly triple the 30,400 in Democratic districts; that’s 74% of clean tech manufacturing jobs going to Republican districts.

Furthermore, the manufacturing news website Manufacturing Dive reports that in 2024 clean energy was one of the three biggest drivers of manufacturing investment in the U.S. — the others were semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Of those three, clean energy manufacturing appears to have added the most new jobs. At a time when overall manufacturing growth is sluggish (and actually declined in 2024), these are the growth areas that you’d think the federal government would want to encourage further.

In politics, this is called cross-pressure, where an officeholder is pulled two different ways — the desire to cut renewable energy credits versus the desire to grow manufacturing jobs.

Some more numbers:

1. Under the overall umbrella of clean energy technology, battery manufacturing has been a particularly strong growth sector, and about 90% of that growth has been due to electric vehicles, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. About 84% of the investment in electric vehicle-related facilities (and electric vehicles are basically big batteries on wheels) has come in 10 states. Last year, all but one of them voted for Trump. The one exception was Illinois. In all, the battery-related jobs in those 10 states account for 72,500 jobs. Lead-acid batteries account for about 60% of the market; the average wage at those jobs is $81,600, according to the Battery Council.

2. Over the past two years, solar panel manufacturers have announced more than 44,000 jobs in the United States. Of the 10 states with the most solar jobs, six voted for Trump, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Solar manufacturing jobs average about $60,000 a year, according to Indeed.com.

3. The single fastest-growing job in the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is that of wind turbine technician, for which the median pay is about $62,000 a year. Of the eight states with the biggest demand, six voted for Trump.

Republicans would not dare call this the Green New Deal, but this is the Green New Deal — the premise that the transition to renewable energy can and will create jobs. The catch, of course, is that it’s not creating those jobs in the same places where fossil fuel jobs are going away, such as Appalachia, but that’s a topic I’ve harped on before. Nonetheless, renewable energy is creating manufacturing jobs and doing so mostly in Republican areas, largely because Republicans govern the states in the Sunbelt where manufacturing of all types is growing fastest (a topic for a future column), although in the case of wind, it’s because the windiest states are Republican ones in the Midwest.

Republicans may not like the economics involved — they may prefer to see a more free-market approach without any tax credits to goose a particular sector — but as a practical matter, a bill they didn’t like is helping to create jobs for their constituents. You can see why some Republican senators are now starting to raise questions about the House bill, with a particular focus on the phaseout of many of these renewable energy credits. In the coming weeks, as these details get debated, we’re not going to hear about carbon emissions or melting ice caps or rising sea levels, we’re going to hear about investment dollars and job counts, which makes for a very different discussion.

Last week, Virginia’s Commission on Electric Utility Regulation — known by the unflattering acronym of CEUR, pronounced “sewer” — heard from Ben Norris of the Solar Energy Industries Association. He warned that the U.S. House bill would cripple further growth of solar energy. That might seem good news for those in rural areas who think solar “farms” are an ugly, industrial blight on the landscape but not such good news for those who want the lights to come on: Norris spelled out how much solar wouldn’t be developed — enough to supply the entire state of Pennsylvania is how he measured it. That might bother those who wonder how we’re going to meet rising power demands but might not bother those who think we should just power the grid with natural gas and coal, anyway.

However, Norris also said doing away with the tax credit would eliminate more than 300,000 solar-related jobs over the next three years, with 86,000 of those in manufacturing and more than 200,000 in construction. While doing away with those credits may satisfy one set of Republican goals, they seem to run directly counter to other Republican goals — specifically creating manufacturing jobs, particularly good-paying ones (and good-paying ones in rural areas). As William Shakespeare once observed, “aye, there’s the rub.”

The Rhodium Group recently came up with a data set of all the energy-related jobs eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and organized that data set by congressional district. Here’s what it shows for Virginia, with congressional districts ranked by order of investment announced:

Whether you go by investment already in the ground, or investment promised, the two districts with the most investment, and four of the top five, are Republican districts. The bottom five districts, including three with zero IRA-eligible districts, are all Democratic districts. Going simply by that, you’d think these tax credits were a Republican invention, not a Democratic one.

Personally, I’m not especially moved by these investment numbers. The 2nd District ranks so high because of Dominion Energy’s offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.) The 5th District ranks next highest because of all the solar development across Southside. In the case of solar, there is a lot of investment across Southside, but, after construction is completed, those solar farms don’t create many jobs. That’s why I’m much more interested in the jobs analysis:

The order of the districts is different here, but the pattern is the same: The top two districts, and five of the top six, are all Republican districts. Southside’s 5th District represented by John McGuire has more than twice as many IRA-eligible jobs as the next biggest district, the 9th District represented by Morgan Griffith.

Why is this, since I just said all those solar farms don’t create many jobs? Now we’re into the details, but we need to understand these details if we want to understand what’s going on. One of the more interesting energy policy debates is on the left, between those who think nuclear energy is dangerous and dirty and those who think it may be the only way to retire a lot of fossil fuel sources. The Biden administration was pro-nuclear, so the Inflation Reduction Act has a lot of incentives for nuclear energy. That’s why the 5th District ranks so high — all those nuclear-related jobs with BWX Technologies and Framatone in Lynchburg, plus Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear plant in Louisa County. Some might look at these rankings and think, wow, the 5th District has a lot of green energy; others who know more about the district will look at these rankings and say there sure are a lot of nuclear jobs there.

The Republicans who want to strip out the tax credits for renewables want to keep the incentives for nuclear, so the number of jobs in the district potentially at risk if the lack of tax credits dries up the renewable energy sector isn’t nearly that high. Alas, the data doesn’t give further breakdowns, so consider those 5th District numbers with an asterisk beside them to account for all the nuclear-related jobs that aren’t endangered.

However, even if we take out nuclear, the 5th District still has at least 2,000-plus jobs potentially at risk — the jobs that Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced last year would be coming to Pittsylvania County in the form of a Microporous battery plant. Virginia, for multiple reasons, had fallen just outside the so-called “battery belt” that has arisen in the Southeast — until that Microporous announcement. The company hasn’t commented, but that firm has been counting on growth in the battery sector. If the end of these renewable energy tax credits slows that growth, well, you can do the math. Furthermore, the Trump administration has yet to deliver a $100 million grant to Microporous that was promised by the Biden administration. In Virginia, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax County, last week posted a New York Times story that reported the Republican tax bill “would gut subsidies for battery manufacturing.” Surovell’s comment on X, formerly known as Twitter: “Why does the GOP hate Pittsylvania County?” I don’t think they hate Pittsylvania County, but they hate the tax credits that Pittylvania might benefit from.

It is curious that after a Republican-voting locality, and a Republican governor, worked so hard to lure a major employer whose arrival would be transformative for the region, a Republican Congress and a Republican president might undo all that economic development. The same is true for some other places. Volvo Trucks in Pulaski County and Mack Trucks in Roanoke County now produce a lot of electric vehicles; they also were promised grants that the Trump administration hasn’t followed through on. The Microporous plant in Pittsylvania has yet to come, but Volvo and Mack are already here; the green economy is very real to the shift workers there.

Here’s where we start to tie all this together.

Microporous said the average wage for those jobs would be $60,000, above the county’s median household income of $54,115.

Trump’s basic instincts aren’t wrong on this one: The United States could do with more manufacturing jobs. However, why is he focused on people turning “little screws” for low wages when we already have a one manufacturing sector that’s not only growing but is growing high-wage jobs? Shouldn’t that one be the one we try to grow even more? This leaves me with some questions:

Is the elimination of those renewable energy tax credits worth the slowdown in those high-wage manufacturing jobs? Or, put another way, is philosophy more important than practicality?

Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?

Given how most congressional districts are either strongly Republican or strongly Democratic, would there be any political price to be paid if that clean energy manufacturing job growth in Republican districts slows down or comes to a halt?

Is this even a sector we want to grow? If you believe that renewable energy isn’t something we need, then perhaps not, even if it is producing high-paying manufacturing jobs.

Notice that none of this has to do with how you feel about carbon emissions and “saving the planet,” but everything to do with creating high-wage manufacturing jobs and building a new economy in many rural areas. Pittsylvania County may be ground zero for this debate, with Pulaski County a close second.

Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" citing concerns over its potential to increase the federal deficit and hinder government efficiency efforts. The proposed legislation, backed by President Trump, includes tax cuts, stricter Medicaid rules, and reduced clean energy incentives.

Elon Musk has expressed disappointment over a sweeping domestic policy bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed by House Republicans last week. He warned that it could worsen the federal deficit and undermine efforts to improve government efficiency.

Dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by Trump, the legislation includes an extension of his hallmark 2017 tax cuts, stricter Medicaid work requirements, increased border security funding, and a proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits.

It now moves to the Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain.

“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told CBS Sunday Morning in an interview airing June 1. He was referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which the billionaire recently stepped back from.

Musk’s comments also highlight a broader philosophical split. As the former head of the DOGE, Musk once led a sweeping push to trim federal spending. The current bill’s deficit-heavy profile contradicts DOGE’s original mission.

“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” he added. “But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.”

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would add $3.8 trillion to the federal deficit by 2034, an outcome at odds with Musk’s stated goal of improving fiscal discipline in Washington.

Tesla could suffer from clean energy cuts

Although Musk did not mention Tesla directly, the proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits has raised concerns for the company. Tesla and other clean technology firms currently benefit from incentives that reduce the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar installations for consumers.

According to a Bloomberg report, under the Inflation Reduction Act, EV buyers are eligible for up to $7,500 in tax credits. Solar systems qualify for a 30% investment tax credit. Reducing or eliminating these incentives could affect both pricing and consumer demand across the clean energy sector.

Tesla, General Motors, and other EV manufacturers, as well as their customers, could be among the hardest hit. Former President Biden’s climate law expanded the $7,500 credit to include new, used, and commercial EVs.

As per the report, the Republican plan would scale back or repeal the consumer EV credit by the end of 2025. Beginning in 2026, only manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs by the end of this year would remain eligible. Tesla and GM have already surpassed that threshold. The bill would also eliminate credits for used and commercial EVs. Congressional estimates suggest the total rollback would save the government more than $190 billion over the next decade.

These changes could reduce demand for Tesla’s popular models such as the Model Y and Cybertruck. They may also weaken the appeal of EVs more broadly. Tesla’s volume-led growth strategy could suffer, along with its competitive edge, especially as traditional carmakers and Chinese rivals continue to benefit from local incentives.

Musk has not yet publicly addressed how these proposed changes could impact Tesla’s business.

Solar incentives also at risk

The bill also targets clean energy tax breaks that support Tesla’s solar and energy storage divisions, along with the wider green technology sector.

Bloomberg reported that homeowners would no longer be eligible for a 30% tax credit on solar panel installations and other clean energy systems after this year. This change would be a setback for consumers planning to invest in sustainable energy solutions.

The rollback would affect not only Tesla’s products like the Powerwall and Megapack, but also companies such as Enphase Energy and SolarEdge Technologies. The measure is expected to save the government $77 billion over a ten-year period, as per the report.

Musk’s remarks also point to growing distance between him and Trump, despite their earlier cooperation. The bill faces significant opposition in the Senate, where its final form remains uncertain.

“We are so far away from an acceptable bill, it’s hard to say,” said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, according to Bloomberg.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.
Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.
“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.
“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.","Japanese insurer Tokio Marine has set up a unit to insure activities linked to the low-carbon transition such as green hydrogen, shipping and cement and is targeting $1 billion in revenues by the end of the decade, its chair told Reuters.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.

TMGX will offer up to $500 million in cover on any single risk and is targeting at least a 10% share of the global premium income market in 2030, estimated at around $10 billion, he said.

While some peers had already begun to write more transition-linked business, most had done so using existing sectoral teams rather than creating a dedicated unit, he said.

“We’re going to rip up the rule-card a little bit here,” McLachlan said.

“We’re going to look at some new technologies, we’re going to look at more sophisticated ways of being able to risk transfer business,” such as offering insurance for tax credits and surety guarantees.

Launching with existing GCube headcount of around 50 and revenue of around $200 million, both would likely double over the next couple of years, he said. Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.

Among the new technologies TMGX would look to cover include small and middle market nuclear, hydrogen, fuel cells, new solar technologies including floating solar and electric vehicles, he said.

“There’s a lot of sectors that really haven’t been served by the insurance space,” McLachlan said.

Another area ripe for extra help was the market for tax credit insurance, where businesses get cover in case they are unable to access the credits as planned, thereby lowering their risk to bank lenders and the interest rate on borrowing.

“It’s a win-win. Lenders love it as it transfers their risk; we like it, we’re getting a premium for a risk we’re comfortable with; and it allows the project to be financed at more equitable terms.”

The company could also look to strike deals with managing general agents, intermediaries given authority by the insurer to write business in their name, saving them the time and expense of building out a team.

“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.

Finding more innovative ways to finance the risks associated with the transition was critical if the world is to hit its climate goals.

“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.

Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean.
In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.","Li-Cycle once seemed like a leader among the startups trying to recycle electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. Now it’s mired in bankruptcy proceedings.

The company’s board replaced the CEO and CFO in a decision announced May 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was looking for buyers. A potential deal with mining giant and lead creditor Glencore evidently had not come to fruition: Two weeks later, a Canadian bankruptcy court appointed Alvarez & Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has loaned $10.5 million to keep things going during the proceedings. Glencore also entered a ​“stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the $275 million it previously invested in Li-Cycle.

“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez & Marsal pitch in a flyer for the sale.

That ​“compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general. A few years ago, the sector was flush with venture capital and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs while minimizing mining. The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.

Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.

Li-Cycle successfully built five ​“spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.

The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.

The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office finalized a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle never drew on that federal money because it couldn’t secure additional private funding to hold in reserve, as stipulated in the loan terms.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

The adjacent U.S. EV sector has seen slower growth than expected, which has in turn reduced the urgency of building out a North American battery supply chain. Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean. And battery makers have increasingly turned to lithium iron phosphate, a cheaper alternative to nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries, further reducing the value of recycling these batteries.

In the past year, a fire destroyed the largest battery shredding plant in the U.S., Interco’s Critical Mineral Recovery site in Missouri. Reno, Nevada–based Aqua Metals ran low on funds and laid off staff while it searched for financing to build a commercial-scale recycling line. Ascend Elements delayed construction of its flagship recycling plant in Kentucky, citing a customer’s decision to postpone buying the recycled materials. In March, Ascend canceled plans to make cathode active materials in Kentucky to focus on precursor materials and lithium carbonate.

Redwood Materials is the rare bright spot. The venture by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel raised a couple billion dollars and has been building out a major compound in the desert outside Reno, not far from Tesla’s factory there. In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.

The industry’s challenges come as the Trump administration says it aims to expand U.S. mineral supplies. Paradoxically, the administration has taken steps to undermine the fledgling U.S. EV and battery industries, which are the big drivers of demand growth for rare earth metals. The budget bill passed by the House last week would strip tax incentives for EV purchases and battery installations, weakening demand for the domestic supply chain that recyclers like Li-Cycle hoped to serve — and making the tough road for recycling firms even tougher.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Operations-Page-Resize-1.webp?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=8d94a574e5bf3ec0fe0d4d0f9871c125,N,,2025-05-28 07:04:39.234451

“LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs.
In response to NRDC's win challenging a separate LNG terminal, FERC voluntarily rescinded its approval for CP2 for additional consideration.
In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) granted conditional authorization for the terminal to export LNG to non–free trade agreement countries.
The CP2 LNG project is the fourth permitted major LNG facility for Arlington, Virginia-based Venture Global.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Committee (FERC) re-approved the Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) liquefied natural gas export terminal on Friday, essentially greenlighting the polluting project.

In September 2024, NRDC and partners at the Sierra Club and the Southern Environmental Law Center challenged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the CP2 LNG terminal and the CP Express Pipeline in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

“Moving forward with CP2 is bad news for the American public and for our climate,” said Gillian Giannetti, senior attorney at NRDC. “LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs. FERC once again greenlighting CP2 is throwing the health of our communities and the public interest out the window just to line the pockets of fossil-fuel-industry billionaires. NRDC remains dedicated to protecting Gulf communities affected by this dangerous proposal.”

“This decision is both unlawful and morally indefensible,” said Megan Gibson, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “FERC is once again rubber-stamping fossil fuel infrastructure that will permanently displace fishermen, effectively eradicate their way of life, bulldoze fragile coastal wetlands, and lock in decades of pollution for export. There is no public benefit here—only private gain for a company aiming to export U.S. gas overseas.”

Background:

In June 2024, FERC approved Venture Global LNG, LLC's application to construct and operate the CP2 LNG export terminal located in the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. It also approved the CP Express Pipeline, an 85.4-mile pipeline that would feed up to 4.4 million dekatherms of gas per day from eastern Texas to the CP2 facility for the sole purpose of exporting LNG overseas.

In September 2024, NRDC and our partners challenged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the CP2 LNG terminal and the CP Express Pipeline in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. NRDC argued that FERC violated the law by not taking the adverse environmental, economic, and socioeconomic impacts seriously when it approved this project. In response to NRDC's win challenging a separate LNG terminal, FERC voluntarily rescinded its approval for CP2 for additional consideration. In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) granted conditional authorization for the terminal to export LNG to non–free trade agreement countries.

The CP2 LNG project is the fourth permitted major LNG facility for Arlington, Virginia-based Venture Global. It is estimated that this CP2 alone will emit greenhouse gas amounts that are equivalent to putting more than 1.85 million additional gas-fueled automobiles on the road. FERC also predicts that the ambient air quality around the project will exceed the national air quality standards for multiple air pollutants.

NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists. Established in 1970, NRDC uses science, policy, law and people power to confront the climate crisis, protect public health and safeguard nature.

The European Commission expects emissions to fall by 54 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, very close to its 55 percent target, it said, after analysing member states' energy and climate plans for the coming years.
But despite everything that is going on today, we do feel we have good news, and we're pleased to say that the EU is well on track to achieve its 2030 target,"" climate chief Wopke Hoekstra, said.

But negotiations are stalling between EU countries on the 2040 target, and the commission has shied away from formally proposing the 90-percent cut to member states.","The European Union is on track to reach its 2030 climate targets, Brussels said on Wednesday, but uncertainty remains over the bloc's ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions much further by 2040.

The European Commission expects emissions to fall by 54 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, very close to its 55 percent target, it said, after analysing member states' energy and climate plans for the coming years.

The EU, however, faces a tough balancing act.

It is seeking to boost European industry confronted by fierce competition in the United States and China, ramp up its defenses faced with Russia, and tackle climate change that is wreaking havoc at an alarming pace with wildfires and floods.

""The world is in a full geopolitical winter. But despite everything that is going on today, we do feel we have good news, and we're pleased to say that the EU is well on track to achieve its 2030 target,"" climate chief Wopke Hoekstra, said.

""It is also fair to say that the ambition on paper needs to be matched by ambition in the real world,"" Hoekstra told reporters in Brussels.

The bloc has already cut emissions by 37 percent compared to 1990, including an eight-percent drop in 2023, the commission said.

Brussels said most member states were now aligned with the target of reaching a share of renewable energy in total consumption of 42.5 percent by 2030.

The commission, however, pointed to disparities between member states on cutting emissions and highlighted the problems of protecting forests and carbon storage.

It singled out Belgium, Estonia and Poland, which have not submitted their energy and climate plans, urging them to ""do so without delay"".

""We have reasons to be proud, although we cannot be satisfied. We've come a long way, but we're not where we need to be yet,"" said energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

- Flexibility -

Climate Action Network Europe's Giulia Nardi said the 2030 targets were achievable ""but without effective national policies and credible financing -- both of which are largely lacking in the updated plans -- implementation will fall short.""

The EU has set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and Brussels wants to agree on an interim target for 2040 -- with the commission seeking to cut emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990 levels.

""A clear target for 2040 and giving predictability, in our view, is important,"" Hoekstra said.

But negotiations are stalling between EU countries on the 2040 target, and the commission has shied away from formally proposing the 90-percent cut to member states.

For some countries like the Czech Republic and Italy, the target is unrealistic.

The commission is considering greater flexibility in its calculations for 2040, including through the purchase of carbon credits on international markets.

The EU's executive arm insists it will submit a formal proposal before the summer and stresses that the bloc will be ready for the next UN COP30 climate conference, which will be held in November in the Amazonian city of Belem in Brazil.

- Cutting red tape -

The delays have raised concerns among environmental groups, which have urged Europe to take the lead on fighting climate change -- US President Donald Trump having withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement after his return to the White House in January.

Environment defenders are also fearful of a wholesale unravelling of the European Green Deal, a landmark package of measures that defined commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term in office but has since come increasingly under fire.

Von der Leyen's commission has slashed red tape within months of taking office as the political sphere has also changed with right-wing gains across Europe.

Brussels has taken the axe to environmental rules affecting businesses -- with France and Germany going further in demanding they be scrapped -- and also delayed its anti-deforestation law.

A Strategic Leap in Lithium Exploration

In a move that underscores its commitment to sustainable energy solutions, Elektros Inc. has achieved significant milestones in its Sierra Leone operations. The company's latest geological surveys reveal lithium concentrations surpassing initial projections, indicating the potential for one of the most substantial lithium deposits in West Africa.

Elon Musk, the visionary behind Tesla, has long emphasized the critical role of lithium in the future of transportation. High-grade lithium, particularly from secure and ethical sources, is not just a preference for Musk-it is a necessity. As the backbone of electric vehicle batteries, lithium determines the efficiency, range, and sustainability of EVs. Musk has repeatedly highlighted the importance of lithium supply chains in public statements, stating that lithium refining and sourcing are among the biggest constraints to Tesla's growth. The discovery of high-grade lithium in Sierra Leone by Elektros Inc. could align with Musk's strategic vision for securing dependable lithium resources, further accelerating the global adoption of clean energy vehicles.

""Our findings in Sierra Leone are not just promising-they're transformative,"" stated Shlomo Bleier, CEO of Elektros Inc. ""This expedition propels us into a new era of energy innovation, aligning with global demands for clean and efficient power sources.""

Capitalizing on Global Energy Trends

The urgency for lithium, a critical component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage, has never been more pronounced. With major automakers like Tesla and BMW intensifying their search for reliable lithium sources, Elektros Inc.'s advancements come at a pivotal moment.

Industry analysts highlight the strategic importance of West African lithium reserves in diversifying the global supply chain, reducing dependency on traditional markets, and fostering economic growth in emerging regions.

Investor-Centric Growth and Market Potential

Elektros Inc.'s streamlined share structure and proactive exploration strategies have caught the attention of investors seeking opportunities in the booming EV and renewable energy sectors.

The key thing about the incentives is to incentivize the companies to make the products at all. Prices are going down, but products are also being canceled and delayed.

It’s not the tax credits. The batteries are dropping in cost rapidly almost every year. They dropped 75% in 10 years and then like 20-30% the last two years. And they’re finally getting EV production facilities up to scale and paying off initial R&D and amortization costs.

The bill specifically targets CCS activities near the Mohomet Aquifer, a groundwater source that serves as the sole source of drinking water for central Illinois residents. Bill language specifies that the CCS activities would continue to be allowed in other areas of the state. In addition, the legislation creates a study commission that would investigate the safety of allowing CCS projects near the Mohomet Aquifer.

In its first quarter earnings call, held May 7, Alto Ingredients President and CEO Bryan McGregor briefly referenced SB 1723, noting the bill was complicating plans to add CCS capabilities at the company’s campus in Pekin, Illinois. At that time, McGregor indicated the company was working with elected officials to minimize the potential legal impact of the legislation on its CCS initiative. He also said Alto is also working to develop options to ensure the company can optimize the value of its CO2 production no matter what the outcome of the legislation, including plans to relocate the proposed CO2 storage location.

[53] U.S. Department of Energy, “TESLA,” 2024, https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla.","In 2025, federal workforce reductions disrupted several core agencies under the Department of Energy (DOE), igniting renewed concerns over the resilience of the United States’ energy systems and the integrity of national security protocols. These cuts, enacted under the broader reorganization agenda of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), were promoted as necessary cost-saving measures within Donald Trump’s fiscal reform campaign.1 However, the nature and scope of the reductions have raised questions about the federal government’s ability to maintain stable energy governance, respond to emerging threats, and support the nation’s long-term transition toward a more secure and sustainable energy future.

As a central pillar of U.S. energy and security policy, the DOE is tasked with safeguarding nuclear materials, guiding clean energy innovation, and ensuring the reliability of the national power grid. The sudden contraction of its workforce has disrupted these functions, exposing serious vulnerabilities in operational capacity, regulatory oversight, and interagency coordination.2 Agencies deemed essential to national interest have also faced institutional uncertainty, prompting concerns about how strategic energy functions can continue under diminished staffing. While the administration’s rationale emphasizes efficiency, the uneven application of these cuts, particularly their concentration in departments linked to climate and energy policy, suggests a deeper politicization of bureaucratic restructuring. These developments highlight a growing disconnect between fiscal ideology and functional governance, demanding closer scrutiny of how workforce decisions shape the future of U.S. energy security.

This paper evaluates the impact of the 2025 federal workforce reductions, measuring the extent of weakened U.S. energy infrastructure. In analyzing the potential for nuclear oversight, regional grid instability, and the undermining of long-term clean energy initiatives, these developments could present a disconnect between the pursuit of administrative efficiency and the functional imperatives of national energy security. From a stability standpoint, the reductions in workforce affect institutional coherence while leaving essential agencies unprepared for emerging challenges. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for the federal government’s role in energy governance and policy frameworks to safeguard public safety, energy sovereignty, and long-term environmental resilience.

Undermining of Nuclear Security

To streamline federal operations, the U.S. has restructured key oversight mechanisms in its energy sector, most notably in governing nuclear infrastructure. The 2025 wave of federal workforce reductions, introduced under the pretext of administrative efficiency and fiscal responsibility, has impacted the oversight mechanisms for safeguarding nuclear energy systems, suggesting a misalignment between governance efficiency and the federal responsibility to uphold energy sovereignty and public safety.3 Of particular concern are the cuts to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency under the DOE tasked with ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s civilian nuclear energy systems and nuclear materials management.4 The loss of personnel within this agency, particularly at high-level energy research institutions including Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, signals not merely administrative downsizing but a substantive degradation of national energy security capacity and institutional operational readiness.5

The layoffs have affected both long-term federal employees and probationary staff, including nuclear safety engineers, emergency energy response planners, and compliance auditors whose roles were central to protecting nuclear materials, enforcing regulatory standards, and managing energy-related emergencies. Their abrupt removal has disrupted essential regulatory timelines and left critical facilities without adequate personnel to ensure compliance, monitoring, and emergency response. Furthermore, around 2,000 DOE employees, with some working for the NNSA, were removed from their positions.6 Although Trump reversed the layoffs, the agency was unable to contact former employees who needed to be rehired.7

The impact is already visible in the Pacific Northwest region, where layoffs at the Hanford nuclear site and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) have delayed critical infrastructure projects, safety audits, and radioactive waste management protocols. Hanford now operates under reduced regulatory supervision, exacerbating risks tied to unresolved nuclear waste storage issues.8 Meanwhile, Bonneville’s role in stabilizing the grid and integrating nuclear generation sources has been undercut by personnel losses, increasing the likelihood of operational disruptions during periods of peak electricity demand or cyber intrusions targeting nuclear-grid interdependencies.9 Given the challenges surrounding nuclear systems, ensuring safety requires skilled personnel and real-time judgment, factors that automation alone cannot substitute. As demonstrated by the 2012 Y-12 breach, over-reliance on automated systems can compromise even the most secure energy sites.10 This dynamic parallels key lessons from the 2011 Fukushima disaster, where institutional paralysis and delayed decision-making were more consequential than the physical damage itself in escalating the crisis.11 According to DOE-affiliated workforce data, the reductions have interrupted energy costs while impacting energy security.12 Emergency preparedness has also been affected, with workforce reductions impacting interagency energy response drills, including simulations of large-scale nuclear grid failures or targeted attacks on power plants.13 Budget constraints and staffing shortages led to the cancellation of vital contingency exercises in 2025, leaving the nation exposed in the event of a real crisis.14 Analysts warn that this lack of coordinated practice risks a dangerous false sense of readiness.

Institutionally, layoffs have disrupted oversight and research programs central to nuclear energy innovation, including nonproliferation, medical isotope production, and safety training. The suspension of contracts at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations highlights the breakdown of linkages between energy innovation and oversight.15 These offices not only advanced clean nuclear technologies but also ensured compliance with projects funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The U.S. Government Accountability Office highlights a broader constitutional dilemma, arguing that the executive branch’s impoundment of appropriated clean energy funds may constitute a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.16 If deemed unlawful, the policy decisions driving workforce reductions could be challenged for undermining statutory energy objectives.

From a national security perspective, the strategic cost of dismantling federal nuclear energy capacity outweighs any short-term fiscal gains. Energy securitization theory underscores that energy systems, especially those tied to nuclear governance, are not just technical infrastructures but existential assets requiring state protection.17 In this light, the erosion of staffing and oversight at critical agencies compromises the state’s ability to treat energy as a matter of national survival, diminishing both resilience and global credibility in the energy domain.

While appeals to bureaucratic efficiency may satisfy short-term budgetary priorities, the resultant degradation of nuclear oversight institutions has exposed critical vulnerabilities in national energy governance. The resulting institutional thinning at the NNSA and affiliated DOE bodies has not only delayed key regulatory functions but also fractured long-term policy frameworks, eroding the federal government’s capacity to uphold its obligations under clean energy legislation and nuclear safety mandates.18 At a time of intensifying geopolitical threats and growing energy demand, the attrition of nuclear oversight capacity signals not only bureaucratic miscalculation but also a structural failure to integrate resilience, continuity, and security into national energy governance.

Threats to Power Grid Reliability and Regional Infrastructure

The U.S. energy transition, while strategically essential, now faces mounting operational risks as federal workforce reductions undermine the centralized institutions historically responsible for grid oversight and national energy coherence. Recent large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, executed under the Trump administration’s DOGE, have imposed a shift on the institutions historically tasked with sustaining and modernizing America’s energy infrastructure.19 This disruption has weakened BPA’s ability to manage the Pacific Northwest grid, particularly in high-voltage transmission and outage response.20

Figure 2: Federal Workforce Reductions

Roughly 420 workers were terminated from BPA alone, accounting for 13% of 3,100 managing the Pacific Northwest’s electricity supply.21 Such reductions are not limited to BPA; over 2,000 employees in the Department of the Interior, including those in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, both of which are instrumental in issuing permits and maintaining power generation infrastructure, have also been dismissed.22 Nationwide, more than 60,000 federal workers have been laid off since February 2025, with an additional 75,000 taking buyouts.23 This unprecedented downsizing threatens the federal government’s ability to uphold energy security mandates, maintain infrastructure continuity, and coordinate the integration of clean energy technologies. While advocates of a leaner government argue that states and private firms can compensate for federal pullback, the consequences suggest delayed energy integration, increased cyber vulnerabilities, and administrative bottlenecks across critical grid infrastructure.24 Particularly at risk are regionally integrated energy systems that rely on interjurisdictional coordination, which only the federal government is positioned to provide, highlighting a growing disconnect between administrative retrenchment and the functional imperatives of energy governance.

The operational challenges facing the BPA exemplify these broader systemic vulnerabilities. Operating over 15,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, BPA’s efficient performance depends on skilled staff capable of real-time grid monitoring, outage response, and long-term infrastructure planning.25 With a drastically reduced workforce, routine maintenance is being delayed, grid modernization initiatives are stalling, and project backlogs are swelling. These challenges reduce grid stability today and compromise future upgrades needed for a decarbonized economy.

Federal workforce reductions have also hindered progress in renewable energy integration, a cornerstone of the nation’s decarbonization strategy. The pause in disbursements under the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), mandated by Section 7 of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, has paralyzed projects designed to expand grid capacity through the integration of utility-scale solar arrays.26 These federal investments were foundational to many state and local efforts, especially in areas that lack the capital or regulatory capacity to deploy such technologies independently.27 As a result, energy transition timelines are slipping, and states that once stood at the forefront of clean energy leadership are now scrambling to reconfigure their development plans.

Moreover, the BPA and other regional transmission organizations are facing a compounding crisis in cybersecurity. The attrition of federal cybersecurity personnel and reduced funding for grid resilience initiatives have resulted in delayed software patching, limited breach response capacity, and increased exposure to SCADA system vulnerabilities across smart grid platforms.28 These cybersecurity vulnerabilities are emerging amid escalating geopolitical tensions and documented cyber intrusions by state-linked actors, including those affiliated with Russia, Iran, and China. A diminished federal presence hampers not just detection and mitigation, but also the ability to coordinate across jurisdictions in response to a breach. Without cohesive governance from agencies like the DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, America’s grid grows more fragmented and less prepared for coordinated attacks or natural disasters.

Critics of the federal workforce model have argued that state governments and private actors can fill the operational vacuum. However, this perspective neglects the integrative function federal agencies perform in coordinating across state boundaries and ensuring standardization in disaster response. For instance, interstate electricity transmission projects, particularly high-voltage direct current lines, require unified oversight to align environmental reviews, synchronize technical standards, and allocate costs.29 Additionally, many states simply lack the technical workforce, regulatory infrastructure, or financial resources to absorb the sudden departure of thousands of experienced federal workers. This is particularly evident in rural and tribal communities, such as those in Alaska and New Mexico, where energy permitting and mineral extraction are not just economic drivers but essential to public service delivery.30 New Mexico’s federal land offices, which oversee drilling on federal land, contributing over one-third of the state’s general fund, are experiencing permitting delays.31 More than 22 tribes and nonprofits from Alaska to the Midwest, having around $350 million in federal funding, were impacted by frozen infrastructure projects.32 Furthermore, the BLM office in Utah has lost over 55 employees, including engineers, park rangers, and geologists since early 2025 due to mass resignations, firings, and rescinded job offers under federal workforce reductions.33 This bureaucratic inertia jeopardizes everything from clean energy projects and transmission upgrades to environmental safeguards and Indigenous land rights.

From a macroeconomic lens, the federal government’s role in sustaining local energy economies cannot be overstated. According to recent findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, approximately 86% of U.S. jobs are in sectors vulnerable to disruptions from the energy transition, with carbon-intensive communities exhibiting disproportionately high employment vulnerability.34 The concept of an Employment Carbon Footprint reveals that even regions not traditionally associated with fossil fuel extraction, such as manufacturing-heavy counties in the Great Plains, may suffer job losses due to federal divestment from energy and environmental services.35 Workforce reductions at agencies like the DOE risk compounding these vulnerabilities, especially in communities already excluded from just transition protections under the IRA.

There is also a profound distributive justice dimension to this problem. According to the Center for American Progress, every congressional district in the U.S. employs over 3,000 federal workers, the vast majority of whom are embedded within their local economies.36 These jobs support families, fund schools through income taxes, and sustain small businesses through consumption. Consequently, the dismissal of federal employees involved in grid oversight, regulatory review, and environmental enforcement has triggered economic contractions in local economies, particularly in rural regions. Moreover, the loss of institutional knowledge, particularly among senior civil servants and specialized engineers, cannot be easily or quickly replaced.

The erosion of institutional capacity in the energy sector compromises not only the domestic resilience but also the U.S. geopolitical credibility in advancing clean energy leadership. This institutional degradation risks impeding innovation in renewable integration and diminishing U.S. strategic competitiveness vis-à-vis global leaders, such as China and the European Union, in clean energy deployment and export capacity. Furthermore, a degraded federal apparatus limits America’s ability to respond effectively to climate-related disasters, such as wildfires, heatwaves, or hurricanes that increasingly threaten energy infrastructure in regions like the Gulf Coast and the Southwest.

Impact on Clean Energy Initiatives

The scale and speed of federal workforce reductions enacted in early 2025 under the “Workforce Optimization Initiative” have significantly impaired the operational capacity of several critical U.S. agencies, with particularly acute effects on the Loan Programs Office (LPO).37 Although publicly justified as efforts to streamline bureaucracy and limit regulatory capture, the reductions have materially constrained the federal government’s capacity to administer and implement clean energy. At the center of the disruption is the erosion of institutional oversight, particularly in the financing, administration, and monitoring of renewable energy projects that constitute a core component of the nation’s long-term strategy for energy independence and economic resilience.38

The LPO has historically played a pivotal role in catalyzing clean energy innovation, having facilitated over $35 billion in financing for projects across the solar, wind, nuclear, and hydrogen sectors.39 This core mandate has been structurally weakened, diminishing the LPO’s ability to evaluate proposals, manage disbursements, and conduct performance reviews across clean energy portfolios. Layoffs implemented in February 2025 reportedly resulted in the termination of approximately 45 employees from the LPO, an agency already operating with limited staff capacity.40 The effects of these reductions have been both immediate and structurally consequential, delaying the disbursement of IRA and IIJA funds and weakening the federal apparatus essential to maintaining the energy infrastructure. These delays disrupt the capital deployment timeline for renewable projects, disproportionately affecting rural and underserved regions where private-sector financing is contingent on federal loan guarantees. In parallel, the diminished capacity for program monitoring and oversight raises the risk of financial mismanagement, cost overruns, and inadequate compliance enforcement, thereby weakening public trust and policy effectiveness.41

Effective clean energy transitions depend on stable federal coordination, particularly during foundational stages of infrastructure deployment, interagency governance, and regulatory oversight, functions now affected by workforce instability. The loss of federal institutional capacity impairs the coordination mechanisms, due diligence processes, and co-financing structures necessary for effective public-private collaboration in clean energy deployment. From the standpoint of liberal institutionalism, which emphasizes the necessity of transparent and stable governance mechanisms,42 this institutional attrition constitutes a significant barrier to coherent climate governance while undermining the state’s ability to align national energy planning with long-term economic modernization strategies.

The stated rationale for the reductions, outlined in the 26 February 2025 memorandum issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was to eliminate non-statutory functions and prioritize the removal of positions not legally required.43 While the LPO is not a standalone statutory agency, its role is grounded in legislative mandates under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.44 Despite this, the LPO was not granted any exemptions under the new policy. The decision to target the agency as “non-essential” during funding lapses disregarded its strategic importance to national energy goals. As of mid-February 2025, approximately 1,000 probationary employees had been dismissed, more than 300 from the NNSA.45 Despite the partial reinstatement of staff in other DOE branches, more than 2,700 employees have applied for buyouts under the department’s deferred resignation program.46 These reductions coincided with the Department’s initial efforts to implement over $500 billion in clean energy investments authorized under the IRA.47 With limited personnel, the LPO now faces mounting bottlenecks in the approval and disbursement of funds for utility-scale solar farms, green hydrogen hubs, and advanced nuclear reactor projects. Prolonged project financing delays not only undermine investor confidence and emissions goals but also erode the strategic foundations of U.S. energy sovereignty and its credibility as a global leader in climate and energy diplomacy.

One such example is the DOE’s Hydrogen Hub program, designed to stimulate regional hydrogen economies. Due to staffing constraints at the LPO, project selection and fund disbursement have been delayed in key states such as Texas, Ohio, and Louisiana, regions where hydrogen infrastructure is critical to decarbonizing industrial sectors.48 Furthermore, the layoffs have significantly stalled review and approval processes within the DOE’s conditional loan portfolio, which includes over $200 billion in pending applications.49 Despite progress under the IRA, current projections indicate that the United States will fall 23% to 37% short of its 2030 emissions reduction target, undermining both national climate commitments and the credibility of its international leadership on climate action.50

The LPO’s role in de-risking early-stage clean energy technologies by providing critical financial guarantees that catalyze private sector investment has also been significantly weakened. With the dismissal of technical reviewers, legal experts, and environmental compliance officers, the agency is now less able to assess whether funded projects are meeting benchmarks for emissions reductions, economic development, and technological advancement. This institutional erosion is especially concerning given the historical lessons of prior clean energy cycles, where lack of oversight capacity, such as the Solyndra case, resulted in political backlash, diminished public trust, and weakened regulatory integrity.51 During the loan guarantee cycle under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2008-2012, high-profile project failures, most notably Solyndra, were attributed to insufficient due diligence.52 In response, the LPO instituted multiple layers of risk assessment and accountability mechanisms. These safeguards are now at risk of being dismantled, exposing both federal funds and taxpayer confidence to renewed uncertainty.

The potential consequences of diminished LPO capacity can also be illustrated by its past success stories. A prominent example is the LPO’s 2010 loan to Tesla Motors, which enabled the company to scale its electric vehicle production during a financially precarious period.53 This underscores how federal support for nascent technologies can yield transformative outcomes, a dynamic now threatened by the erosion of institutional capability. A further complication is the loss of institutional knowledge. Numerous reports confirm that the affected employees included mid-career specialists with extensive experience navigating the technical, legal, and regulatory complexities of the clean energy sector. The hiring constraints imposed by the January 2025 Presidential Memorandum, restricting recruitment to one position per four departures, have structurally impeded the agency’s ability to regenerate lost institutional capacity.54 President Donald Trump has extended the ongoing federal hiring freeze through mid-July, preventing agencies from filling vacant positions or establishing new roles for three months. 55

The broader policy implications extend beyond federal agencies. The National Governors Association has publicly raised concerns over the erosion of intergovernmental coordination frameworks, emphasizing the resultant delays in multi-level energy governance and implementation.56 Internationally, the workforce reductions may also impair the U.S. standing in global climate diplomacy. Whereas the previous administration had positioned green infrastructure as a cornerstone of foreign policy, the retrenchment under the current administration marks a strategic retrenchment that weakens the U.S. negotiating position at international climate forums and undermines its normative influence in multilateral climate finance structures. At forums such as COP29, the loss of federal momentum weakens the credibility of U.S. climate commitments and risks emboldening other major emitters to delay their own energy transitions. Undermining this model through domestic retrenchment compromises U.S. influence in shaping global finance norms and limits efforts to mobilize private capital for global decarbonization.

Critics, including energy policy experts, bipartisan stakeholders, and environmental NGOs, have argued that the decision to target the LPO was not merely a cost-saving measure but one rooted in ideological opposition to clean energy. This framing disregards the cross-partisan support historically enjoyed by clean energy programs, which are widely recognized for their contributions to national security, technological leadership, and economic growth. In response to growing legal challenges, multiple federal judges have issued rulings declaring aspects of the reduction-in-force (RIF) process unlawful, particularly in cases involving probationary employees.57 However, these decisions have not mandated full reinstatement of affected personnel, and future rounds of layoffs remain possible. Agency leaders now face legal uncertainty and mounting responsibilities without the staff fulfilling them. Congressional staff briefings obtained by the Congressional Research Service further suggest that applying RIF procedures to statutorily grounded agencies may have overstepped executive authority, raising legal and constitutional concerns regarding the balance between fiscal control and governance.58

Conclusion

The 2025 federal workforce reductions have revealed a profound misalignment between administrative efficiency initiatives and the structural imperatives of U.S. energy governance. While framed as a necessary response to fiscal constraints, the scale and concentration of these reductions in critical energy agencies have produced destabilizing effects across nuclear oversight, power grid reliability, and clean energy program implementation. The disruption to agencies such as the NNSA, the BPA and the LPO has not only weakened operational capacity but also affected the institutional continuity required to manage the evolving demands of energy security, infrastructure modernization, and climate resilience.

The consequences extend beyond administrative inefficiency. The reductions have delayed infrastructure projects, hampered emergency preparedness, introduced cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and undermined the disbursement of funding under the IRA and IIJA. The federal government’s reduced presence is particularly acute in rural, tribal, and economically vulnerable communities, where federal coordination plays a critical role in ensuring access to energy resources, permitting, and long-term investment planning. Additionally, the loss of specialized personnel has eroded institutional memory and technical capacity, further limiting the federal government’s ability to carry out legally mandated energy functions.

Considering the United States’ role in clean energy deployment and climate diplomacy, the erosion of federal institutional capacity poses strategic risks. The inability to meet domestic emissions targets weakens the credibility of international commitments and threatens to reduce the influence of the United States in shaping global climate governance frameworks. As the energy transition accelerates worldwide, the U.S. risks falling behind in technological competitiveness, regulatory innovation, and the global energy export market.

To restore resilience, the federal government must urgently reinvest in its energy workforce, uphold statutory obligations, and align budgetary decisions with national energy priorities. Stabilizing institutional capacity across agencies is essential to safeguarding national security, accelerating decarbonization, and preserving U.S. credibility on the international stage. Future policymaking must recognize that administrative streamlining, if disregarded from strategic imperatives, can undermine the very functions it seeks to optimize.

""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said.
Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.
Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs.
""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said.","PHOENIX — Candidate Daniel Hernandez says the next member of Congress needs to be someone who pays less attention to environmental concerns and more to the jobs that sometimes-controversial projects will create.

Whether that reflects who Democrats want to be their standard bearer in the special election this summer to replace ardent environmental advocate Raúl Grijalva remains to be seen, after voters elected Grijalva to 11 terms in the U.S. House. He died in March of complications from cancer treatments at age 77 while holding the Congressional District 7 seat.

""When people are struggling to make ends meet, they need someone who will stand up to make sure they have good wages, protections for their families, and make sure that they have a job to be able to go to,'' said Hernandez, a former state lawmaker, during a debate Tuesday hosted by KAET-TV, the Phoenix PBS affiliate.

He is one of five Democratic candidates running in the special July 15 primary, who all took part in the debate.

Whoever survives will face off on Sept. 23 against the winner of the Republican primary. But the Democratic nominee will start off with a huge advantage. The district has about 176,000 registered Democrats, compared with fewer than 93,000 Republicans. It stretches from Douglas through Nogales into parts of Pinal and Maricopa counties and west to Yuma.

Hernandez made it clear he supports projects such as the plan by South32 to extract critical minerals in the Patagonia Mountains; a massive copper mine planned by Hudbay in the Santa Rita Mountains; and a proposal to build a new Interstate 11, including a stretch that would run through environmentally sensitive portions of Pima County.

That brought him into sharp contrast with one of the other contenders: Adelita Grijalva, who is not only a former Pima County supervisor, but also Raúl's daughter. She made it clear she does not see the claimed benefits to Arizona from the projects. The profits from digging out the ore will be shipped elsewhere, she said.

""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said. She specifically criticized the plans for a new copper mine at Oak Flat near Superior, a project that survived a challenge when the U.S. Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider concerns of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others that the land is necessary for their ceremonies.

And if the message about what voters could expect wasn't crystal clear, Grijalva said she will follow in her father's footsteps.

""I am going to be another Grijalva,'' she said. ""I don't think you can be too progressive when you're on the right side of history.''

Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.

Candidate Jose Malvido, whose father was a union organizer at Phelps Dodge in Ajo when miners went on strike in 1983, said much has been lost as environmental concerns were brushed aside in the name of economic development.

""I grew up in a copper mining town where sacred sites were reduced into a giant mine pit,'' Malvido said. ""It put food on the table, but at what cost?''

Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs. At the same time, he said, they destroy the environment.

But for him, the question is a bit different: Where do the profits go?

""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said. ""That profit is being siphoned out of the district. There are (other) good-paying jobs that can be brought into the district.''

And candidate Deja Foxx said that from her perspective — she is 25 — not enough has been done to protect the environment that should have been preserved for her generation.

""Every year we see summers get hotter here in Arizona, get longer because of the inaction of older generations,'' she said.

""Climate change is not theoretical to my generation,'' Foxx continued. ""We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.''

But Grijalva did find herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.

The contenders each were asked about the wisdom of Republicans in Washington who say that reducing taxes is good for the economy and should also be considered by Democrats, who have found themselves losing ground politically.

Hernandez responded that the difference is Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working-class families. Or ""most Democrats,"" he said.

""The reality is people like Adelita tried to raise taxes just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Tucson,'' Hernandez said, referring to a plan on the ballot to increase the sales tax by half a cent. ""When we are in the height of inflation and people are hurting, the height of being out of touch was trying to raise people's taxes.''

It failed by a margin of more than 2-1.

""What we have is a problem where out-of-touch politicians who spent almost two decades in office forget what it's like to be able to buy groceries at the grocery store, and know what it's like to have to put something back,'' Hernandez said.

Grijalva was unapologetic for backing the proposed levy, saying that not just Tucson but Pima County have had to absorb more costs to provide government services even as the Republican-controlled Legislature was imposing a flat 2.5% income tax. Local governments get a piece of that levy.

""So the needs continue but the revenue decreased,'' Grijalva said, saying that the cost of these local needs must be shared by federal and state governments.

""You're still trying to raise people's taxes in the height of inflation,'' Hernandez responded.

Foxx took her own shots at Grijalva, describing her fight years ago with the Tucson Unified School District board, on which Grijalva served, over its sex education curriculum. Foxx said it had not been updated in decades, was medically inaccurate, and never mentioned things like consent.

Grijalva said afterwards that the board already had been looking at making changes when Foxx made her complaints, but could not do anything until state law was changed.

If there was a central theme to the debate — aside from the obligatory criticism by each contender of Republican President Donald Trump — it was the question of why Democrats recently fared poorly among voters. Foxx said part of that is due to Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.

""We require activists,'' Foxx said.

""They don't know how to fight,'' Harris said of Democrats. ""They don't have a strategy.''

Malvido agreed that Democrats are not fighting back hard enough against Trump.

""We need to have the courage to really address issues and not worry about the big money people that also fund the Democratic campaigns,'' he said.

""A lot of Democrats, career politicians, all they really want to do is get elected,'' Malvido said. ""So they're not really going to address the issues and have the courage to fight in the way we need them to fight, especially now.''

Hernandez said the issue for voters goes beyond whether the Democrats are fighting hard enough.

""It's that we're not delivering results,'' he said.

""You elect people time and time again and yet they come back every two years and they say, 'We weren't able to do that because that other person was in charge, but elect us and we'll do it again next time,' '' Hernandez said. ""People are tired of empty promises.''

One position that did stand out was Harris' proposal for what he called ""capitated capitalism.''

In essence, it would cap individual wealth at $1 billion. Anyone whose assets exceeded that at the end of any year would have to spend the excess on things like investing in research.

All that spending, he said, would help stimulate the economy.

""I'm the only one with an economic plan to fund our shared priorities,'' Harris said.

The three Republicans hoping to clinch their own party's nomination in the July special election will debate at KAET on Thursday. They are Daniel Butierez, Jorge Rivas and Jimmy Rodriguez.

“Building these homes is an opportunity to support industries and jobs here at home, but it is far from Canada’s only growing economic opportunity.

“Change means rethinking our trade relationships, investing in new and growing industries, building faster and more efficiently, and ensuring that affordability and sustainability are written into the DNA of all of these efforts from day one. It is clear, as mentioned in the Throne Speech, that Canada can and should action an industrial strategy that will both make us more globally competitive and combat climate change. These are not distinct but complementary objectives.

“Multiple studies, from the International Energy Agency to modelling done in Canada, find that household energy bills will shrink as we near net zero. Our research at Clean Energy Canada has similarly found that, already, switching to clean energy saves families money—even when you factor in upfront costs.

“It is also the case that building with low-carbon construction materials does not need to add cost to building, but it can seriously lower emissions. In both cases, what is required is foresight. And a recognition that we must not only build homes affordably—but homes that are affordable to live in month to month.

“Building these homes is an opportunity to support industries and jobs here at home, but it is far from Canada’s only growing economic opportunity. Canada has trade agreements with 60% of the global economy, making us well positioned to lessen our reliance on U.S. markets. And as recent Clean Energy Canada analysis shows, among our 10 largest non-U.S. trade partners, all of them have net-zero commitments and carbon pricing systems, and roughly half apply carbon border adjustments on imports and have domestic EV requirements reshaping their car markets.

“The potential for Canada’s critical minerals, innovative clean technologies, and low-carbon industrial products is huge, ongoing, and an opportunity whose future we can be certain of.

Additionally, the 2026 EV9 complies with battery component and critical mineral sourcing criteria necessary for the tax credit.
It’s important to note that the federal EV tax credit program is subject to potential legislative changes.","Kia America on Monday unveiled pricing details and key updates for the 2026 Kia EV9, the automaker’s all-electric, three-row sport utility vehicle. Entering its third model year, the EV9 remains largely consistent with its original form but introduces a slate of meaningful refinements aimed at elevating both style and performance.

The headline addition is the new Nightfall Edition, an appearance-focused package now available on the Land AWD trim. With a commanding aesthetic defined by exclusive 20-inch gloss black alloy wheels, darkened Kia badging, and high-gloss black exterior elements, the Nightfall Edition introduces a fresh visual edge to the EV9’s sophisticated design. Inside, drivers will find distinctive seat stitching, bespoke interior trim, and subtle yet impactful design flourishes that separate it from other trims. It is available in both 6- and 7-passenger configurations, offering flexibility for families without additional cost.

Kia’s pricing for the 2026 EV9 lineup is as follows (excluding the $1,495 destination fee):

EV9 Light Standard Range – $54,900

EV9 Light Long Range – $57,900

EV9 Wind – $63,900

EV9 Land – $68,900

EV9 GT-Line – $71,900

A Sharpened Identity, A Longer Road Ahead

Beyond the Nightfall Edition, Kia’s 2026 EV9 lineup benefits from increased electric driving range on select trims. The Light Long Range model now offers an estimated 305 miles of range (Kia estimate), giving it the longest range in the lineup. The Wind and Land trims are now expected to achieve approximately 283 miles, while the sportier GT-Line is rated at an estimated 280 miles on a full charge. While these numbers remain manufacturer estimates and are subject to variation based on driving conditions, they reflect Kia’s continued refinement of battery and software efficiency.

Also new across all all-wheel drive variants is the addition of a Terrain Mode system—replacing the outgoing 4WD configuration—which enables driver-selectable modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand, enhancing off-road capability and traction across diverse terrain.

The EV9 retains its foundation as a modular, rear-biased electric platform (E-GMP) vehicle, supporting ultra-fast DC fast charging thanks to its 800-volt architecture. According to Kia, the EV9 can recoup up to 155 miles of range in approximately 15 minutes under optimal charging conditions. The long-range trims feature a 99.8 kWh battery, while the base Standard Range trim is equipped with a smaller 76.1 kWh pack.

Subtle Refinements in Color and Character

A refreshed exterior color palette brings a new sense of visual depth to the 2026 model year. The GT-Line now offers two new dual-tone colorways: Glacial White Pearl and Wolf Gray, each paired with a contrasting Ebony Black roof. The Nightfall Edition introduces a rich new exterior finish dubbed Roadrider Brown, alongside its exclusive interior detailing. These refinements add nuance to a vehicle already recognized for its bold silhouette and tech-forward design.

Inside the Cabin: Technology Meets Comfort

The EV9’s cabin remains one of the most spacious and advanced in the segment. A sweeping panoramic display integrates a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, and a dedicated 5.0-inch climate control panel. Kia’s latest Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) system powers the user experience, now featuring over-the-air update capability and support for a growing suite of digital services.

Advanced driver-assist systems remain standard across most trims, including Highway Driving Assist 2, Blind-Spot View Monitor, and Remote Smart Parking Assist 2, depending on configuration. The interior also offers tri-zone climate control, available premium relaxation seats with leg rests, and multiple USB-C charging ports in all three rows.

A Sustainable Brand in an Evolving Market

Kia continues to solidify its position among the most sustainability-conscious automakers. The EV9’s design incorporates recycled and bio-based materials throughout the cabin, and several trims—including the EV9 and the EV6—are assembled in the United States using both domestic and global components.

All pricing figures exclude taxes, licensing, and dealer fees. Estimated electric ranges are preliminary and not EPA-certified. Vehicle availability may vary by market. Always consult a retailer for the latest information.

As of May 2025, the Kia EV9 is eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit starting with the 2026 model year.

The eligibility for the 2026 EV9 is due to Kia’s production of this model in Georgia, meeting the North American assembly requirement. Additionally, the 2026 EV9 complies with battery component and critical mineral sourcing criteria necessary for the tax credit. However, early production units intended for fleet allocation and the GT trim, which is built in South Korea, are exceptions and do not qualify for the credit.

For the 2025 model year, the EV9 does not meet the federal tax credit requirements, even if assembled in the U.S., due to non-compliance with battery sourcing rules.

It’s important to note that the federal EV tax credit program is subject to potential legislative changes. A bill introduced by the House Ways and Means Committee proposes to eliminate key EV tax credits by the end of 2026, which could affect future eligibility.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-28 06:02:50.656165

This is mainly because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor only includes generating units that are visible or metered by balancing authorities.
On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.
While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports.
This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks and reports electricity generation in the country through different methods, leading to data that may not always match. EIA publishes electricity net generation data from two main perspectives. One is a detailed monthly summary of every power plant connected to the grid in the United States that has at least 1 megawatt (MW) of nameplate capacity. This information is shared in the Electric Power Monthly, Electric Power Annual, and related data files. The second is hourly net generation data reported by local and regional balancing authorities, specifically for the Lower 48 states, which is available in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor.

These two types of data reports often show different results because they do not reflect the same sets of generating units. As a result, if someone adds up the hourly generation data over a month or a year from the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, the total will not match the figures reported in the Electric Power Monthly or Electric Power Annual. This is mainly because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor only includes generating units that are visible or metered by balancing authorities. A balancing authority is responsible for managing the balance of electricity supply and demand in a specific region. These authorities can include large organizations like CAISO in California or the Southwest Power Pool, as well as smaller local entities.

However, balancing authorities usually do not track generation from distributed energy systems such as rooftop solar panels or from certain small-scale units. As a result, those distributed sources often do not appear in the hourly data. On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.

To help users understand what is included in each set of data, EIA has published lists of electric generators. The Electric Power Monthly and Annual datasets have long included a list of the generators they track. Recently, EIA also published a new list for the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, which only includes generators that are metered by balancing authorities based on responses to a new survey launched last year.

While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports. For instance, CAISO includes in its reports the generation from four power plants located in Mexico because it meters those plants. This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.

Despite these differences, analysts can still reconcile the two sets of data by using the EIA plant codes and generator IDs. These identifiers appear across multiple EIA datasets, including the Annual Electric Generator Report and Power Plant Operations Report, allowing researchers to trace and compare generation details at the individual plant level.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-918986.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 04:01:59.741720

A new fuel cell could enable electric airplanes that produce zero carbon emissions, according to a study.

Scientists say the devices could pack three times as much energy per pound as today’s best EV batteries - offering a lightweight option for powering planes, lorries or ships.

Batteries are currently nearing their limits in terms of how much power they can store for a given weight.

Researchers explained that it is a serious problem for energy innovation and the search for new ways to power airplanes, trains and ships.

Now, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have come up with a solution that could help electrify transportation systems.

Instead of a battery, the new concept is a kind of fuel cell - which is similar to a battery but can be quickly refuelled rather than recharged.

In the new system, the fuel is liquid sodium metal - an inexpensive and widely available commodity.

The other side of the cell is just ordinary air, which serves as a source of oxygen atoms.

In between, a layer of solid ceramic material serves as the electrolyte, allowing sodium ions to pass freely through, and a porous air-facing electrode helps the sodium to chemically react with oxygen and produce electricity.

The research team showed in a series of experiments with a prototype device that the cell could carry more than three times as much energy per unit of weight as the lithium-ion batteries used in virtually all electric vehicles today.

Professor Yet-Ming Chiang said, “We expect people to think that this is a totally crazy idea.

""If they didn’t, I’d be a bit disappointed because if people don’t think something is totally crazy at first, it probably isn’t going to be that revolutionary.”

He says the technology does appear to have the potential to be quite revolutionary, particularly for aviation, where weight is especially crucial.

The researchers believe such an improvement in energy density could be the breakthrough that finally makes electrically powered flight practical at a significant scale.

Chiang said: “The threshold that you really need for realistic electric aviation is about 1,000 watt-hours per kilogram.

""Today’s electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries top out at about 300 watt-hours per kilogram — nowhere near what’s needed.""

Even at 1,000 watt-hours per kilo, he says, that wouldn’t be enough to enable transcontinental or trans-Atlantic flights.

That’s still beyond reach for any known battery chemistry, but Chiang says that getting to 1,000 watts per kilo would be an enabling technology for regional electric aviation, which accounts for about 80% of domestic flights and 30% of the emissions from aviation.

The technology could be an enabler for other sectors as well - including marine and rail transportation, according to the study published in the journal Joule.

Chiang said: “They all require very high energy density, and they all require low cost.

“And that’s what attracted us to sodium metal.

“People have been aware of the energy density you could get with metal-air batteries for a very long time, and it’s been hugely attractive, but it’s just never been realized in practice.""

He said tests using an air stream with a carefully controlled humidity level produced a level of nearly 1,700 watt-hours per kilo at the level of an individual “stack” - which would translate to over 1,000 watt-hours at the full system level.

The researchers envision that to use this system in an aircraft, fuel packs containing stacks of cells, like racks of food trays in a cafeteria, would be inserted into the fuel cells.

The sodium metal inside the packs gets chemically transformed as it provides the power.

A stream of its chemical by-product is given off, and in the case of aircraft, it would be emitted out the back, not unlike the exhaust from a jet engine.

However, there would be no carbon dioxide emissions.

Instead, the emissions, consisting of sodium oxide, would actually soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The researchers say the compound would quickly combine with moisture in the air to make sodium hydroxide - a material commonly used as a drain cleaner - which readily combines with carbon dioxide to form a solid material, sodium carbonate, which in turn forms sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda.

Chiang added: “There’s this natural cascade of reactions that happens when you start with sodium metal.

“It’s all spontaneous. We don’t have to do anything to make it happen, we just have to fly the airplane.”

He said that, as an added benefit, if the final product, the sodium bicarbonate, ends up in the ocean, it could help to de-acidify the water, countering another of the damaging effects of greenhouse gases.

Chiang also emphasized that the new fuel cell is ""inherently safer"" than many other batteries.

He explained that sodium metal is extremely reactive and must be well-protected.

As with lithium batteries, sodium can spontaneously ignite if exposed to moisture.

Chiang said: “Whenever you have a very high energy density battery, safety is always a concern, because if there’s a rupture of the membrane that separates the two reactants, you can have a runaway reaction.

""But in this fuel cell, one side is just air, which is dilute and limited.

""So you don’t have two concentrated reactants right next to each other. If you’re pushing for really, really high energy density, you’d rather have a fuel cell than a battery for safety reasons.”

While the device so far exists only as a small, single-cell prototype, Chiang says the system should be ""quite straightforward"" to scale up to practical sizes for commercialization.

Members of the research team have already formed a company, Propel Aero, to develop the technology.

The system they envisage would use a refillable cartridge, which would be filled with liquid sodium metal and sealed.

When it’s depleted, it would be returned to a refilling station and loaded with fresh sodium.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hazard-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/5a/55ae4bf6-97c2-5c91-9c47-c564b52ccb92/6835e8d46be98.image.png?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-28 12:28:48.261295

According to our Manufacturing Sector Trends report, one third (34 per cent) of manufacturers already believe their organisation will invest in ‘green’ or ‘clean’ technology. For some, this will look like securing funding for onsite generation; for others it will involve entering a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a long-term contract to draw power from a renewable energy generator.

Skyrocketing energy bills, government tax cuts for green investment and the moral imperative are just some of the factors pushing manufacturers towards finding cheaper, clean power sources. However, another pressing reason to prioritise clean energy is improving your employer brand: the way you are perceived as an employer, and therefore your ability to attract and retain talent. With the modern workforce increasingly demonstrating concern about environmental issues, join the dots between sustainability and your skills strategy.

Passion for sustainability

As the climate crisis dominates the news cycle, workers are beginning to choose and reject jobs based on environmental concerns. 37% of UK working adults say they would avoid working for a company with poor green credentials, and in the younger generations this is only set to continue, with one-third of young people rejecting job offers based on businesses’ sustainability stances. Attracting Gen Z and Alpha to manufacturing requires cultural evolution, as we have already explored in a previous blog, and investing in clean energy is one way to make your organisation more attractive to the next wave of talent. Some companies have already fallen victim to employee action, with Shell workers addressing their CEO publicly to express deep concern about a lack of investment in renewables. Leaders underestimate their workforce’s passion for sustainability at their own risk.

In a sector faced with a significant skills shortage, failing to invest in clean energy sources could result in your business losing out on top talent to greener competitors. The Royal Mint, for example, launched its own green energy centre in July 2023, to power its 38-acre manufacturing site, and builds sustainability clearly into its employer messaging, with sustainability strategy falling under its Great Place to Work branding. To cater to an eco-conscious jobs market, manufacturers must both work towards green goals and communicate them effectively.

Authentic change

However, a commitment to sustainability should not be viewed as a quick win for employer branding. Instead, it must be a long-term cultural shift with myriad benefits, of which favourable positioning on the job market is just one. Those leading the move towards clean energy must avoid greenwashing, where companies make unsubstantiated claims about sustainability credentials or enact only surface level change, without real impact. Nearly 43% of employees believe their company is guilty of greenwashing, with this number increasing to 56% among 18- to 24-year-olds.

Whereas other sustainability initiatives, such as publishing aspirational targets or purchasing carbon offsets, could be seen as avoiding tackling the problem head-on, investing in clean energy sources is proof of a long-term commitment. Organisations can also avoid accusations of greenwashing by taking their team with them for the journey, with 9 in 10 global employees claiming that easier-to-understand sustainability reporting would help them build trust in their company’s achievements.

International Day of Clean Energy is the perfect opportunity to educate employees and prospective new team members about the investments in sustainable power sources that your company is already making, ensuring that your efforts regarding sustainability can be fully maximised for attraction and retention purposes.

Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said:

“Nuclear energy has a potentially large role to play in meeting rising energy demand with emissions-free, reliable and scalable power – and the United States indeed has much to gain by advancing projects domestically and, through exports, globally. But it will take a suite of supportive policies that derisk the first wave of nuclear investments and incentivize private sector participation to scale promising new technologies.

While it is encouraging to see a focus on building a series of large reactors of existing designs and uprates, as well as smaller newer designs, the U.S. will struggle to deploy and build new projects at the scale necessary to tackle energy security and leadership in nuclear technology. In particular, the orders do not highlight or even call for policies to share the financial risk and provide revenue certainty for early large standardized ‘orderbook’ reactor deployment – essential elements for future deployment.

This gap is all the more troubling because they appeared in the same week the House voted to diminish crucial tax credits that reduce the costs of new plants by up to 40% and restrict the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is essential to finance the first wave of new plants and is called upon by one of the president’s executive orders to help deploy 10 GWs of new, large reactors. Congress must oppose these measures if the U.S. is to have any hope of achieving the goal set by the executive orders to quadruple American nuclear energy capacity and safely export American advanced nuclear energy technologies worldwide.

CATF shares the administration’s goal of unlocking advanced nuclear energy and will continue to advocate for strong government leadership to deliver safe, clean, and reliable nuclear energy at an affordable cost. But to accomplish this, a bolder and more cohesive strategy will be required.”

Environmental advocates worry Illinois may delay the retirement of coal plants to help meet its rising electricity demand, largely caused by new data centers and AI. Meanwhile, renewable energy projects in Illinois are in limbo as they wait to get permission from the state’s grid operators PJM and MISO. The act hopes to address these issues, while helping the state meet its renewable energy targets.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is the successor to the 2021 Clean and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which expanded the Illinois Solar for All program from $30 million to $70 million per year, unlocking the benefits of affordable renewable energy for families across the state. CEJA also set a target to get Illinois to 40% renewable energy by 2030 and 50% renewable energy by 2040.

Solar Bill of Rights

The bill creates a Solar Bill of Rights, which aims to establish fair, transparent rules for solar energy across all utility territories within Illinois.

The Solar Bill of Rights requires incentives to be offered to low-income customers, non-profits and public facilities, either directly or through developers, to increase these groups’ participation in community solar.

The bill says the program’s goal is to allocate a minimum of 25% of the program’s incentives to community solar projects in environmental justice communities. It directs the agency to reserve a portion of the program for projects that promote “energy sovereignty” through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households.

The bill also requires the Illinois Power Agency to direct up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All program to community-based groups and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts, such as general energy education and job training program outreach efforts. The Solar Bill of Rights also puts a cap on high insurance requirements for installing rooftop solar.

In Illinois, community solar projects are compensated at the same price that utilities pay to procure and deliver power to their end-use customers. By allowing distributed solar and storage to participate in existing wholesale markets, Illinois’ community solar program lowers costs for ratepayers by adding more options to an already competitive energy supply marketplace. This also enables a more efficient use of ratepayer funds to supplement distributed generation project revenues via capacity-based and renewable energy credit incentives.

(Read: Scaling distributed generation starts with smarter state policy)

Illinois introduced a community solar offering under the Illinois Shines program in 2019. In 2023, ComEd opened enrollment to its first community solar project. As of Q4 2024, Illinois was ranked fourth for its community solar operating capacity and fifth per capita, according to the Institute on Local Self Reliance. Nineteen states and D.C. allow community solar, although legislation is underway in some states that, if successful, would increase that number.

More information about Illinois Bill of Rights can be found in the bill beginning on page 293.

Illinois Storage for All

The act creates the Illinois Storage for All program, which requires the agency to direct up to 25% of the funds toward grants, rebates or incentives designed to encourage renewable energy storage paired with solar distributed renewable energy generation. Illinois Storage for All would be available to current and future participants of low-income customers, nonprofits and public facilities.

Illinois Storage for All would be designed to support community energy resilience, disaster preparedness and energy bill reductions, particularly for low-income and environmental justice communities.

More information about Illinois Storage for All can be found in the bill beginning on page 87.

(Read: Illinois lawmakers propose 15 GW energy storage target by 2035)

Virtual power plant (VPP) program

According to Department of Energy estimates noted in the legislation, the United States could deploy 80 GW to 150 GW of VPPs by 2030 (a tripling of current levels) to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles, saving ratepayers $10 billion per year.

The legislation requires utilities with more than 300,000 customers to develop VPP programs through a standard offer, open-access tariff for distributed energy resources to provide system peak load reduction and other grid services.

More information about the VPP program’s provisions can be found in the bill beginning on page 505.

Time-of-use pricing

The bill establishes opt-in time-of-use rates to “reduce the need for ramping resources and increase the grid’s ability to cost-effectively integrate greater quantities of variable renewable energy and distributed energy resources.”

ComEd currently offers two time-of-use rate programs: Hourly Pricing, which fluctuates based on the actual market rate of electricity at any given hour, and Time-of-Day, which lets customers know a day in advance how much electricity will be during three different periods: off-peak, peak and super peak. For those that don’t require a lot of electricity consumption during peak demand periods, these programs can provide significant savings for participants, along with relief to the grid. For example, as a ComEd customer enrolled in its Hourly Pricing program, the author of this article has saved $290.34 since enrolling in the program 26 months ago.

(See also: Keeping electricity both reliable and affordable while meeting load demand)

At this time, it is unclear how the time-of-use pricing would differ from the programs already offered by ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission told pv magazine USA, “Presently, talks at the Capitol are ongoing and fluid. It would be premature and inappropriate for the ICC to comment on bill impacts on language not fully formed or filed as legislation.”

More information about the time-of-use pricing can be found in the bill beginning on page 499.

Data Centers

Recent analysis from Synapse Energy Economics projected that if the retirement of coal plants are delayed so that more data centers can be powered up, CO2 pollution in Northern Illinois will increase by at least 64%.

The bill directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid. The bill also directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to propose environmental standards for large data centers.

Additional measures

Among other provisions, the bill:

Works to improve infrastructure by increasing transmission and fixing interconnection issues to deploy renewable energy more quickly;

Upgrades resource adequacy studies under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act to examine multiple clean energy options and select the least-cost pathway toward meeting the state’s renewable energy goals while ensuring adequate resources and electric system reliability;

Requires “munis and coops” (electric providers other than ComEd and Ameren) to use industry best practices to forecast and plan for future electricity needs; and

Directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid.

The bill makes tweaks to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resource Fund and Illinois Solar for All program.

For our separate discussion of the provisions of the BBB that affect general business, international, and individual taxation, click here.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate under a process called reconciliation. While the reconciliation process requires only a simple majority of Senate members to approve the BBB, Senate Republicans are not yet aligned on the BBB and significant modifications are expected before it is in agreed form.

Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits (Sections 48E and 45Y)

Accelerated Termination

The BBB would terminate the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (the “ITC”) under Code Section 48E and the Clean Electricity Production Credit (the “PTC”) under Section 45Y for facilities that either —

begin construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB; or

are placed in service after December 31, 2028.2

Under current law, the ITC and PTC gradually phase out for facilities beginning construction after 2032 or, if later, the year in which the United States achieves certain greenhouse gas emissions targets. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed an accelerated phase-out of the credits, however, in a last-minute change before passage of the BBB, the phase-out was changed to complete termination by imposition of deadlines for beginning construction and placement in service. We expect the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC in the BBB to be a focal point for further negotiations when the BBB reaches the Senate.

The addition of an absolute deadline for placing a facility in service will mean that a facility that timely begins construction but encounters unexpected construction delays pushing its placement in service beyond the deadline will be exposed to complete loss of the credits that the facility’s developers anticipated. This risk of complete credit loss will make project financing extremely difficult if the BBB is enacted into law.

Restrictions on Certain Foreign Connections

The BBB imposes restrictions on the ability of entities with certain connections to a “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) to claim the ITC or PTC. These restrictions are sometimes referred to as “FEOC” rules, after an existing statute targeting “Foreign Entities of Concern” that partially inspired these restrictions.

The BBB creates several new defined terms for purposes of these restrictions:

A PFE is either of a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a foreign-influenced entity (“FIE”);

An SFE is an entity designated as a bad actor under the authority of a variety of existing statutes (including the FEOC rules) or a “foreign controlled entity” (“FCE”);

An FCE is (i) the government of a covered nation, (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs;

A “covered nation” is China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea;

An FIE is an entity that (i) may have a board member, executive officer or similar person appointed by, (ii) has a specified percentage of its debt or equity held by, or (iii) in the preceding year made more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to, one or more SFEs;

“Material assistance” from a PFE is any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a PFE; any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE; or any know-how or trade secret provided by a PFE. The definition excludes parts or materials that are (i) not uniquely designed or formulated for use in property that will generate credits under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X, and (ii) are not exclusively or predominantly produced by PFEs.

The restrictions imposed by the BBB include:

An SFE is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning after enactment of the BBB;

An FIE or an entity that in the current year makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to one or more PFEs is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning two years after enactment of the BBB;

For any facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025, the ITC and PTC is entirely disallowed if construction of the facility includes any “material assistance” from a PFE; and

An entity that claims the ITC during a tax year beginning two years after enactment of the BBB is subject to 100% recapture of such ITC if, during any of the 10 years following placement in service of the property generating the ITC, it makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to PFEs.

The restriction on material assistance from a PFE will have no impact if the BBB is enacted by November 1, 2025 and includes the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC. In such case, no facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025 (which would be 60 days after enactment) will be eligible for the ITC or PTC, let alone subject to the material assistance restriction. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, the material assistance restriction will be especially disruptive to ITC and PTC eligibility for any facility that sources unique parts or materials from China or any other covered nation.

No Transferability Restrictions

While the BBB proposes to restrict the transferability (sale) of most clean energy credits, making investment in the underlying clean energy projects less attractive, the BBB makes no changes to the transferability of the ITC and PTC under Section 6418. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed a sunset of ITC and PTC transferability for any facility beginning construction more than two years after the date of enactment, but the BBB as passed by the House does not include any such sunset for these credits, since any such facility would not be eligible for the ITC or PTC under the accelerated termination. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, it is possible that the transferability sunset will be reintroduced for the ITC and PTC.

Note Regarding Legacy ITC and Legacy PTC

The BBB makes no changes with respect to the production tax credit under Section 45 (the “Legacy PTC”) and impacts the investment tax credit under Section 48 (the “Legacy ITC”) only with respect to geothermal heat pump property. Accordingly, any wind, solar, or energy storage technology (among other technologies) that began construction for tax purposes on or before December 31, 2024 may be eligible for the Legacy ITC or Legacy PTC and in such case can avoid altogether the adverse tax consequences proposed under the BBB (including limitations on transferability).

Restrictions on Certain Leased Property Used at Residences (Such as Rooftop Solar)

The BBB disallows the ITC and PTC for certain solar and wind property (but not storage property) (i) of a type that qualifies for the Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D, (ii) that is leased or rented to a third party, and (iii) with respect to which the lessee would be eligible for a credit under Section 25D if the lessee owned the property. If enacted, this restriction may be disruptive to the residential rooftop solar industry, as residential rooftop systems are regularly leased to customers. However, since the BBB would repeal the Section 25D credit for property placed in service after 2025, it is not clear whether this provision would have any practical impact absent changes in the effective dates of the provisions.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z receives unique treatment as the only IRA tax credit to have its availability extended under the BBB. The BBB extends the availability of the credit for transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2031, from the current cutoff date of December 31, 2027. However, the BBB also limits the availability of the credit to sales of transportation fuel exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Additionally, the BBB modifies the determination of emissions rates for purposes of the credit by excluding any emissions attributed to indirect changes to land use and calling for additional Treasury guidance regarding transportation fuels derived from animal manure.

The BBB also makes changes to the Section 45Z credit consistent with changes to other tax credits. The BBB disallows the Section 45Z credit for tax years beginning after enactment for SFEs and for tax years beginning two years after enactment for FIEs. Finally, the BBB repeals transferability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel produced after December 31, 2027.

Other Credits

The BBB includes significant modifications to several other IRA credits:

Carbon Capture -- Section 45Q: The Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit under Section 45Q is largely unchanged by the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Transferability of the credit is repealed for credits derived from the capture of carbon using carbon capture equipment that begins construction more than two years after enactment.

Nuclear -- Section 45U: The Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit under Section 45U is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Termination of the credit is accelerated by one year, with the credit unavailable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2031.

Hydrogen -- Section 45V: The Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen under Section 45V applies only to facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026, instead of the current deadline of January 1, 2033. Current law also offers an ITC for hydrogen storage property. Any taxpayer claiming the ITC for hydrogen storage property would be subject to the same restrictions on the ITC described above, including accelerated termination of the ITC for any hydrogen storage property that begins construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB or is placed in service after December 31, 2028, and FEOC-type restrictions on certain foreign connections.

Manufacturing -- Section 45X: The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X is generally phased out for components sold after December 31, 2031, instead of the current cutoff of December 31, 2032. However, no credit is allowed with respect to wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The credit for the production of critical minerals, which does not phase out under current law, is also phased out after December 31, 2031 under the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. The credit is also disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for any component that includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity or is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE which has a value greater than $1,000,000. Additionally, the credit is disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for taxpayers that make payments to PFEs of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items that are related to the production of eligible components, and which represent more than a specified portion of a taxpayer’s total payment of such items. Transferability of the credit is repealed for components sold after December 31, 2027.

Several other green energy tax credits are, subject to certain narrow exceptions, terminated for tax years after 2025 or for property acquired after December 31, 2025. These include:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit under Section 25C,

The Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D,

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit under Section 45L,

The Credit for Previously Owned Clean Vehicles under Section 25E,

The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit under Section 30C,

The Clean Vehicle Credit under Section 30D, and

The Credit for Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles under Section 45W.

Exceptions exist for credits under Section 45L for homes that began construction before May 12, 2025, Section 45W for vehicles acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025, and Section 30D for vehicles placed in service during 2026 if certain criteria are met.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate before being returned to the House and then sent to the President for approval, at which point it would be expected to become law. We will continue monitoring the BBB’s progress and other developments affecting clean energy tax incentives.

Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison is part of a multi-state coalition of AGs suing the Trump administration over the move.","AILSA CHANG, HOST:

At the same time that the Trump administration is moving to reverse electric vehicle promises made by the Biden administration, some states, even those led by Democrats, might be doing some of the same as they face budget shortfalls. Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters went to see how that's playing out at a dealership in the Twin Cities area.

CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Rob Powell walks through one of his Cornerstone Auto dealerships. He stops by the inventory desk and asks for the keys to an electric vehicle.

ROB POWELL: We don't have one, wow - not used or new, didn't expect that.

MASTERS: Powell says Cornerstone has around 500 new cars across the Twin Cities. Just seven of those are EVs. Now, that could mean EVs are especially popular. But to Powell...

POWELL: There's just not as many of them as there probably should be or used to be.

MASTERS: Every good public radio story starts with stepping inside a car and going for a ride, but we can't do that today.

POWELL: No.

MASTERS: So what should that tell me?

POWELL: I think it's partially through demand, through our ordering process.

MASTERS: And part, he says, it's about the number of cars manufacturers think they can sell in this market. And that number might soon tumble lower. Two years ago in Minnesota, lawmakers tried to encourage drivers to purchase electric vehicles by offering big rebates. This year, those rebates are gone, and in their place, a hike on the surcharges on those same cars.

CAROLYN BERNINGER: You know, we're coming off of Minnesota having its electric vehicle rebate program, which was very popular, but only funded for one year.

MASTERS: Carolyn Berninger is with Drive Electric Minnesota, a trade group looking to accelerate the adoption of EVs.

BERNINGER: And now we're kind of seeing the state go in the opposite direction.

MASTERS: That rebate program offered up to $2,500 for new EVs and $600 for purchases of used ones. But Berninger points out EV adoption in Minnesota is still very low. She's concerned customers won't want to go with an EV when they see that annual surcharge triple, from $75 to $200 starting next year.

BERNINGER: Hiking up fees, and particularly this $200 fee, would require electric vehicle owners to pay more in the electric vehicle fee than a lot of gas car owners pay through the gas tax.

MASTERS: Other states are also rolling EV incentives back. Colorado reduced its tax credit from $5,000 to 3,500. At the federal level, Congress voted to undo federal waivers for California. The White House wants to cancel funding for a $5 billion EV charging station grant program. Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison is part of a multi-state coalition of AGs suing the Trump administration over the move.

KEITH ELLISON: The thing that's happening in the legislature I disagree with, but I can't claim it's unconstitutional. What the president is doing is unconstitutional and illegal, and that's why we're suing him for it.

MASTERS: At the Capitol in St. Paul, Democratic governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz seems ready to pass the surcharge bill.

TIM WALZ: The gas tax is what - how we fund our roads. And the argument is is that EVs use our roads. They add to the maintenance of it. They should pay their fair share on that. And I think most EV owners agree with that.

MASTERS: The House here is tied between Republicans and Democrats this year. Democratic Representative Larry Kraft says he's disappointed lawmakers can't do more to curb climate change.

LARRY KRAFT: The climate doesn't give us a pause. The climate doesn't care about our politics. So the fact that we weren't able to make more progress, yes, I'm very disappointed, and I have renewed emphasis to work on it.

MASTERS: So at the same time that the Trump administration continues to disincentivize EV adoption, lawmakers, even Democrats, may charge Minnesotans a little more to keep their EV registrations up to date. For NPR News, I'm Clay Masters in St. Paul.

To achieve a reductionof 23 per cent would require full implementation of a wide range of policies and plans across all sectors and for these to deliver the anticipated carbon savings.

The first carbon budget and second carbon budget are projected to be exceeded with almost all sectors on a trajectory to exceed their national sectoral emissions ceilings for 2030.

Ireland will not meet its EU Effort Sharing Regulation target of 42 per cent reduction by 2030, instead a maximum reduction of 22% is projected.

Total emissions from the Land Sector are projected to increase by up to 95% and Ireland is unlikely to meet our European commitments in this area.

28th May 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its greenhouse gas emissions projections for the period 2024-2055.

EPA analysis shows that planned climate policies and measures, if fully implemented, could deliver up to 23 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 2018, down from the 29 per cent reduction projected last year. This widening gap to the emissions reduction target of 51 per cent in Ireland’s Climate Act is driven by updated information provided by Governmental bodies.

The first Carbon Budget (2021-2025) of 295 Mt CO2eq is now projected to be exceeded by between 8 to 12 Mt CO2eq. The second budget is now projected to be exceeded by a significant margin of 77 to 114 Mt CO2eq, including carryover from the first Carbon Budget.

Transport, Industry and the Buildings (Residential) sectors are projected to be the furthest from their sectoral emission ceilings in 2030, with emission reductions of up to 21%, 12% and 22% respectively. Agriculture emissions are projected to reduce by up to 16%. A direct comparison of the Agriculture sector against its Sectoral Emission Ceiling is no longer viable due to the impact of updated science underpinning the estimated agriculture greenhouse gas emissions.

Laura Burke, Director General, EPA said:

“The EPA’s projections show that full delivery of all climate action plans and policies could deliver a 23 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Although emissions trends are going in the right direction, the gaps to our European and National emission reduction targets are now projected to be larger than last year. This highlights the economy-wide effort needed to decarbonise our society and the focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation.”

Ms Burke added:

“As we get closer to 2030 and receive more information on the impact of agreed policies and measures, it is concerning to see projected reductions and lack of progress in the delivery of actions to reduce emissions including in the electrification of our transport sector and the expansion of renewable electricity powering our homes and businesses and the implementation of carbon reduction measures in agriculture. Momentum is building for Ireland's low carbon society, but we need to accelerate it and scale up the transition.”

Agriculture

Depending on the level of implementation of measures outlined in Climate Action Plans, AgClimatise and Teagasc MACC, total emissions from the Agriculture sector will range from a 1 per cent increase to a 16 per cent decrease over the period of 2018 to 2030. Savings are projected from a variety of measures including limits on nitrogen fertiliser usage, switching to different fertilisers and bovine feed additives.

Transport

Emissions from the sector are projected to reduce up to 21 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 if the measures set out in plans and policies are implemented. These include over 640,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030, increased biofuel blend rates and measures to support more sustainable transport. Road freight is projected to be the biggest source of road transport greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Residential Emissions

Emissions from the sector arise from fuel combustion for domestic space and hot water heating. These are projected to decrease by up to 22 per cent by 2030. Emission reduction measures in this sector include 571,000 domestic heat pumps are projected to be installed by 2030.

Industry

Fuel combustion in manufacturing is the primary source of emissions in this sector; process emissions from mineral, chemical, and metal industries contribute the next largest portion. Emissions from this sector are projected to reduce by 12 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 with full implementation of measures including the accelerated uptake of carbon-neutral heating technologies for low and high temperature heating, and increased use of biomethane.

Energy

Driven by a reduction in fossil fuel usage and increased net importation of electricity from interconnectors, there was a marked drop of over 21 per cent in emissions from electricity generation between 2022 and 2023. In combination with planned increases in renewable energy generation from wind and solar, energy sector emissions are projected to reduce by up to 68 per cent (over the period 2018 to 2030) and are projected to achieve over 68 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2030.

Land use

Emissions from this sector are projected to increase between 39 per cent to 95 per cent over the period of 2018 to 2030 as our forestry reaches harvesting age and changes from a carbon sink to a carbon source. Planned policies and measures for the sector, such as increased afforestation, water table management on agricultural organic soils and peatland rehabilitation are projected to reduce the extent of the emissions increase.

Commenting, Mary Frances Rochford, Programme Manager said:

“The Agriculture sector has made some progress in reducing emissions through the successful rollout of actions on nitrogen fertilisers, low emission spreading technologies and national liming programmes. In parallel, in line with new research, the EPA refined the information underpinning the agricultural figures which has led to a reduction in the overall agriculture emission estimates. It is imperative that this new research and information is incorporated into updated carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings to ensure that they reflect latest science, data and knowledge on greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and alignment with the national reduction target for the sector of 25%.”

For further detail on these figures, see the EPA report Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections 2024 to 2055 and EPA Greenhouse Gas web resource on the EPA website.

Notes to Editor

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the national body with responsibility to develop, prepare and publish projections of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland. The EPA produces national greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis. These projections are compiled in accordance with, and to meet, EU reporting obligations. At a national level this report informs policy and monitors and reports Ireland’s climate action performance to Government under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act (Amendment) 2021 and to the public as outlined in Climate Action Plans.

It is an obligation under the Climate Act that, where the total greenhouse gas emissions for a preceding budget period exceed the carbon budget for that period, the excess greenhouse gas emissions from the preceding budget period is carried forward to the next period. The carbon budget for the next period is then decreased by the amount carried forward.

The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emission projection is an estimate of what emission levels are likely to be in the future. They are based on key assumptions such as economic growth, fuel prices and Government policy.

This is the fourth set of projections prepared following the enactment of the Climate Act and the 51 per cent target contained therein. The policies and measures contained in the Climate Action Plan 2024 and previous Plans are included in the projections with a number of exceptions including:

Onshore wind of 7.1 GW, offshore wind of 2.7 GW and 6.3 GW of solar PV was required to achieve 68 per cent share of renewable electricity by 2030. This compares with 9 GW onshore wind, 5 GW offshore wind and 8 GW of solar PV stated for the 80 per cent target in the Climate Action Plan 2024;

The full CAP 2024 ambition of 945,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is not modelled. Instead, a total of 640,750 electric vehicles is modelled in the WAM scenario, based on updated information from the Department of Transport;

The full 2 GW target for new flexible gas fired generation is not modelled. However, Eirgrid data was used to produce an adjusted trajectory yielding new gas fired generation of 1.4 GW by 2030;

Climate Action Plan 2023 introduced an Avoid/Shift policy with multiple measures to achieve an abatement of 2.09 Mt CO2 eq by 2030 in transport relative to 2018, which was applied again in the Climate Action Plan 2024. One of these modelled measures relating to price increases in petrol and diesel out to 2030 has no supporting policy and is not modelled;

Measures aimed at achieving emissions savings from a decrease in embodied carbon in construction materials (1.0 Mt CO2 abatement by 2030) aren’t currently modelled;

Emissions reductions associated with Carbon Capture and Storage are not currently modelled;

The Climate Action Plan 2024 target of a 70-75 per cent share in renewable heat in industry is not specifically modelled. Instead, current Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) grant rates are modelled to 2055;

Diversification measures in Agriculture with annual savings by 2030 of 1.5 Mt CO2 eq is not currently modelled;

Unallocated savings of 5.25 Mt CO2 eq per annum 2026-2030 (or 26.25 Mt CO2 eq cumulatively by 2030) as stated in the Climate Action Plan 2024 are not modelled.

New scientific research has led to a reduction in emissions from the Agriculture sector in the 1990 to 2023 national greenhouse gas inventory upon which these projections are based. Estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with non-dairy cattle and sheep categories have been updated.

With respect to non-dairy cattle, models now include additional disaggregation of production systems within the herd and linked to detailed output from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) databases. This approach allows for more detailed estimates of a larger number of production system cohorts from birth to slaughter, revised live weight and average daily weight gain incorporated at more refined levels, and tracks the changes in slaughter age.

With respect to sheep, a Tier 2 approach to estimating emissions from the national flock developed by Teagasc has been implemented. In comparison to the previous approach, which was based on default IPCC Guideline assumptions, country specific parameters associated with sheep production in Ireland are used including parameters such as feed characteristics, fecundity, lambing patterns, mortality, liveweights and liveweight gains.

All methodologies are detailed in Ireland’s National Inventory Document 2025 and summarised in Ireland's Final Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 report.

EU Targets

EU greenhouse gas emission targets and reduction obligations for Ireland are split into two broad categories. The first category covers the large energy and power (i.e. energy intensive) industry which are controlled under the EU Emissions Trading System. The second category deals with the non- EU Emissions Trading System sectors such as agriculture, transport, residential, commercial, waste and non-energy intensive industry.

The Environmental Protection Agency produces greenhouse gas emissions projections on an annual basis for all sectors of the economy in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies. The following are key underlying data that underpin this year’s greenhouse gas emissions projections:

Energy-related emissions projections are based on updated energy projections provided to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in Q1 2025.

The energy projections were prepared in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute who produced energy demand projections using the I3E model (Ireland Environment, Energy and Economy model).

Agriculture emissions projections are based on data from Teagasc which was provided to the Environmental Protection Agency in February 2025.

On 14th May 2018, the European Council adopted a regulation (EU 2018/842 – the Effort Sharing Regulation) on greenhouse gas emission reductions. The regulation sets out binding emission reduction targets for member states in sectors falling outside the scope of the EU emissions trading system for the period 2021-2030. In April 2023 the Effort Sharing Regulation was amended (EU 2023/857) and Ireland’s new 2030 target under the Effort Sharing Regulation is to limit its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 42 per cent by 2030.

Annual emission limits out to 2025 for the 42 per cent reduction were set by the EU in 2023, with limits out to 2030 to be set later in 2025. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation two flexibilities may be utilised to allow for a fair and cost-efficient achievement of the target. These flexibilities are the use of EU Emissions Trading System allowances and credit from action undertaken in the Land use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector.

Flexibilities under the Effort Sharing Regulation include the allowance by eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions with EU ETS allowances which would normally have been auctioned. EU-wide, this cannot be more than a combined total of 100 million tonnes CO2 over the period 2021-2030. The ETS flexibility allows Ireland to transfer emissions of up to 4 per cent of 2005 levels per annum, or 19.1 Mt CO2 eq from the non-ETS to ETS sector, reducing the mitigation requirement in the non-ETS sector while cancelling the corresponding ETS allowances.

Also, to stimulate additional action in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, Member States can use up to a combined (EU-wide) total of 262 million credits over the entire period 2021-2030 to comply with their national targets. The LULUCF flexibility allows for Ireland to account for greenhouse gas removals of up to 26.8 Mt CO2 eq over two compliance periods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030.

Hawaii’s move is also being closely watched by other states considering similar taxes to fight climate-related damage.

Hawaii’s new climate tax targets tourists

Why you should care:

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Tuesday signed legislation that increases the state’s tax on short-term accommodations like hotel rooms and vacation rentals, aiming to raise funds for climate resilience and wildfire prevention.

The new law will boost the daily room rate tax by 0.75%, bringing the total state tax to 11%. That doesn’t include additional state and county taxes, which will push the total levy on accommodations close to 19%—among the highest in the U.S.

The law also introduces a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills starting in July 2026. That tax will be prorated based on how many days a ship is docked in Hawaii.

How the money will be used

What they're saying:

Officials say the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will go toward:

Replenishing eroding beaches like Waikiki

Clearing invasive grasses that increase wildfire risk

Installing hurricane clips to help secure rooftops

Building firebreaks to stop wildfires

Supporting a new state fire marshal role

Green emphasized that the state must take bold steps after the devastating 2023 Lahaina wildfire that killed 102 people and nearly leveled the historic town.

""This is about protecting Hawaii and creating a model for the rest of the country,"" Green said.

Big picture view:

This marks the first tax in the U.S. specifically aimed at funding a state’s climate response. Hawaii’s unique vulnerability to climate impacts—rising seas, stronger storms, and wildfire risk—makes it a testing ground for how tourism dollars might help foot the bill.

Hotels and resorts ultimately supported the measure, arguing that protecting Hawaii’s environment is essential for maintaining its status as a top destination.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1280/720/gettyimages-2160501570.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-05-28 07:04:13.972757

As the digital economy accelerates and generative AI becomes more deeply embedded in business and daily life, the physical infrastructure supporting these technologies is undergoing a transformative explosion.

In this graphic, we use data from McKinsey to show current and projected energy demand from data centers in the United States. Data is from October 2023.

U.S. Data Centers Could Quadruple Power Demand by 2030

Today, data centers account for roughly 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. But by 2030, that share is projected to rise to 12%, driven by unprecedented growth in computing power, storage needs, and AI model training.

In absolute terms, U.S. data center energy demand is set to jump from 224 terawatt-hours in 2025 to 606 terawatt-hours in 2030.

YearConsumption (TWh)% of Total Power Demand 20231474% 20241784% 20252245% 20262927% 20273718% 20284509% 202951310% 203060612%

Meeting this projected demand could require $500 billion in new data center infrastructure, along with a vast expansion of electricity generation, grid capacity, and water-cooling systems. Generative AI alone could require 50–60 GW of additional infrastructure.

This massive investment would also depend on upgrades in permitting, land use, and supply chain logistics. For example, the lead time to power new data centers in large markets such as Northern Virginia can exceed three years. In some cases, lead times for electrical equipment are two years or more.

A Strain on the U.S. Grid

The U.S. has experienced relatively flat power demand since 2007. Models suggest that this stability could be disrupted in the coming years. Data center growth alone could account for 30–40% of all net-new electricity demand through 2030.

Unlike typical power loads, data center demand is constant, dense, and growing exponentially. Facilities often operate 24/7, with little downtime and minimal flexibility to reduce usage.

After the signing of an executive order allowing the United States to take steps toward commercially mining the seafloor, the critical minerals located within the proximity of the islands have proven to be a significant opportunity for economic growth.
Although the US never signed the convention establishing this global organization, they have often promoted and overseen many developments throughout the ISA’s subsequent development.
The World Wildlife Fund has officially stated that “Deep-sea mining could exacerbate [environmental] pressures further, causing irreversible biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, sediment plumes, and the release of toxins and stored carbon.” In American Samoa, deep-sea mining is increasingly likely following Trump’s executive order.
Consequently, seafloor mining remains a microcosm of the Trump Administration’s polarizing attempts to bring economic advantages to the US.","In recent weeks, the Trump administration has found an opportunity in deep-sea mineral mining near the coast of American Samoa. After the signing of an executive order allowing the United States to take steps toward commercially mining the seafloor, the critical minerals located within the proximity of the islands have proven to be a significant opportunity for economic growth. Nickel and cobalt are two of the most valuable resources on the ocean floor and are used to create useful technology, such as batteries and superalloys. According to US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, “Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation’s resilience and safeguarding our national interests.”

In international affairs, this move from the Trump Administration is unprecedented, mainly as this move flies in the face of the International Seabed Authority, which was established in 1982 to regulate the underwater mining industry in international waters. Although the US never signed the convention establishing this global organization, they have often promoted and overseen many developments throughout the ISA’s subsequent development. Leticia Reis de Carvalho, secretary-general of the International Seabed Authority, has written, “No state has the right to unilaterally exploit the mineral resources of the area outside the legal framework established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea… It is common understanding that this prohibition is binding on all States, including those that have not ratified UNCLOS.”

While the US Department of the Interior is seeking input from American Samoan communities and mining experts, many believe that the potential for commercial seafloor mining is exploitative and damaging to the biodiversity of these habitats. The World Wildlife Fund has officially stated that “Deep-sea mining could exacerbate [environmental] pressures further, causing irreversible biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, sediment plumes, and the release of toxins and stored carbon.”

In American Samoa, deep-sea mining is increasingly likely following Trump’s executive order. Yet, many critics on the international stage warn of potential dangers.

Then we'll remain in the situation we're in now: no one willing to take big steps on climate policy, while time is running out.""","Without public trust, effective climate policy is impossible, warns Vincent de Gooyert, sociologist and lead author of the article. ""You see this, for example, in the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS). This technology is essential for achieving climate targets, but it is still barely off the ground. Industry wants government subsidies, the government says there is no public support for this, and society wants to see industry take responsibility first. But then you're stuck in a vicious circle.""

No market value, but essential

The climate debate is currently often framed from a techno-economic perspective, explains De Gooyert. ""Every solution must have direct market value. If that is lacking, no one is willing to take the first step. But a solution such as CCS has no direct market value. In addition to technology, regulations and subsidies, you really need that support, because a policy without support mainly results in resistance.""

De Gooyert collaborated with colleagues Senni Määttä, Sandrino Smeets and Heleen de Coninck on the article. Their recommendations are based, among other things, on extensive experience with discussions between government, business, citizens and other stakeholders on climate issues. They work with environmental organisations, industry and governments in European countries including Finland, Sweden, Spain and Belgium.

Trust

""What keeps coming back is that policy only works if there is mutual trust. People often think that if we explain it well, support will come naturally. But then you mainly have one-way communication, and research shows that this can be counterproductive. What you end up with is people thinking: there go those arrogant policymakers again, telling us what's good for us, and if we don't agree, they'll push it through anyway.""

De Gooyert and his colleagues advocate the use of independent, scientific advisory councils, but also initiatives such as citizens' councils. ""Citizens must be able to form an informed opinion independently, and there must be room for complexity and nuance. We must be honest with each other in such sessions: there are difficult choices to be made, but people must be given openness about the options and the consequences. Citizens deserve a say in their environment. To offer comfort to local residents, governments and businesses will also have to make sacrifices. We won't get there with the current method. Then we'll remain in the situation we're in now: no one willing to take big steps on climate policy, while time is running out.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,N,,2025-05-27 22:04:15.935498

This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""
Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050.
Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees.
China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations.","On Friday, President Donald Trump issued four executive orders aimed at bolstering nuclear power production by addressing supply chain constraints, reforming advanced reactor testing at federal research facilities, and increasing nuclear reactor use on military bases.

One of the most substantive orders calls for a ""wholesale revision"" of regulations governing nuclear power. Specifically, it directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish guidelines that would issue final decisions on all new construction and operation applications within 18 months—a process that currently takes years.

Under the order, the NRC will work with the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to draft these rules, which are due next year. Under an executive order issued in February, executive and independent agencies are required to submit draft and final rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (an office within the OMB) for review and approval.

This added layer of federal scrutiny could end up slowing down reactor approvals and make the NRC less efficient. It could also run contrary to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which established the NRC and its guidelines.

""The NRC is designed to be an independent agency,"" Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute, tells Reason. ""The President has control by appointing Commissioners and has the authority to remove Commissioners for cause."" However, the Atomic Energy Act says that the commission shall execute the provisions of the law, ""not the Commissioners in conjunction with other parts of the Executive branch,"" he says.

Congress has also begun to address permitting delays at the NRC. In 2024, federal lawmakers passed the ADVANCE Act which, among other things, directs the NRC to establish a quicker permitting process for already-approved technologies (18 months to finish safety evaluations and environmental reviews and 25 months to issue a final decision). The agency is expected to issue these guidelines by September, according to the NRC website.

However, the legislation stipulates that these guidelines be enforced to ""the maximum extent possible."" Jack Spencer, a senior energy researcher at The Heritage Foundation, thinks Trump's order could ""bring additional accountability to the process.""

""Any big bureaucracy is going to be resistant to change,"" he says. ""Legislation that basically puts it in their hands to achieve that reform, I think, will often fall short of the sorts of reform that are possible."" Spencer thinks that subjecting the proposed reforms to another set of eyes ""that will ask hard questions will be helpful in ensuring that real reform ultimately takes hold.""

This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""

Federal radiation regulations mandate nuclear power plants to emit levels of radiation that are ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) and are based on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that no level of radiation risk is safe to the public. This framework is not scientific (humans are exposed to natural levels of radiation that are higher than those that nuclear power plants emit) and has pushed up costs for power plant operators for no public safety benefit.

Spencer argues that fixing this rule is critical for reducing the nuclear industry's regulatory burden. ""You can make the NRC the most efficient regulatory agency that has ever existed. And if the basis of its regulatory actions is not grounded in science, then who cares?""

""That doesn't mean that you're reducing safety standards. It means that you're making safety standards in line with actual risks,"" he adds.

This directive could face legal scrutiny.

Stein, who has been critical of these standards, says ""safety standards are almost never implemented through executive order. They usually require the agency to review and 'reconsider' if the standards are appropriate."" With the NRC recently reaffirming its model for radiation standards in 2021, there ""would need to be new scientific evidence to justify a change now that wouldn't be viewed as arbitrary by a court."" Instead of rewriting ALARA standards, Stein suggests that the NRC could adopt radiation thresholds at nuclear power facilities that are defined in the Clean Air Act.

Spencer recognizes these standards can't be changed through an executive order. ""But it gets the conversation going. And it makes it more OK to talk about it, and it subjects the whole issue to daylight and makes people address it.""

Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050. Stein says this goal ""can be a helpful signal to the market,"" but stating a goal does not ""will it into existence.""

Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees. ""It's obtainable if you have the right leadership and you have the right behaviors and you're removing a lot of bureaucratic, unnecessary red tape, whether that be the federal level or the state level or through some regulatory regime.""

America's fleet of commercial nuclear power plants, while still safe and effective, is aging. Most of the reactors were built between 1967 and 1990—although two came online in 2023 and 2024, seven years delayed and $16 billion over budget.

As the U.S. halted its construction, China's has accelerated. From 2014 to April 2024, the nation has added over 34 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to its grid. ""Nearly every Chinese nuclear project that has entered service since 2010 has achieved construction in 7 years or less,"" notes the Breakthrough Institute. China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations. Nearly half of the world's nuclear power plant constructions are happening in China.

While several factors have played into America's pivot away from nuclear power, including market structures, state bans on the energy source, and the introduction of cheap natural gas, the impact of federal regulations cannot be overstated.

""Without doing a refresh and making sure [that] regulations are still applicable, you can get into a point, which we're seeing now, where it's extremely difficult to even cite and permit a piece of land,"" says Edwards. In the past 20 years, regulations have become so onerous that it takes five to seven years and close to $1 billion just to permit and cite a plot of land for nuclear energy development, according to Edwards. Streamlining the licensing process isn't a safety hazard but rather ""a natural iteration that should be a part of our standard process with regulations.""

Regulations have long inhibited American nuclear energy. While Trump's order is well-intentioned to fix this issue, it is sure to face legal challenges—as many of the president's orders have.

Still, the orders may be enough to get a more substantial conversation going. ""I think anything that creates pressure toward reform is good,"" says Spencer.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/5-27-25-v1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 21:01:21.780605

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is investing $888 million at a New York propulsion plant to increase engine production and build a next-generation V8, the company said on Tuesday.

The investment at the Tonawanda propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, first reported by Reuters, is a shift from a previously announced $300 million commitment to make electric-vehicle drive units at the plant.

The move is likely another sign of automakers adapting to slower-than-expected market demand for EVs and comes after the Detroit automaker aggressively lobbied Congress to rescind California electric-vehicle rules.

GM said the investment will support the sixth generation of GM’s V-8 engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs expected to be more fuel-efficient.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the project will support 870 jobs at Tonawanda Propulsion, including 177 jobs deemed at risk. The state plans to provide up to $16.96 million in tax credits in return for investment commitments.

New York said last week it would pause penalties associated with any shortfalls of EV sales for two years.

GM has been more adamant in staying the course on its move to EVs than other automakers, but has also pulled back on some of its previously announced EV investments, including selling its stake in a battery cell plant to battery partner LG Energy.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker has a plan to sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 but has said it will ""be responsive to where the customer is.""

Executives have more recently positioned the company to be focused on adapting to customer demand for EVs, but the automaker has also continued launching the vehicles. It now has about a dozen EVs available in the United States.

GM committed to a $300 million investment for drive unit production at the Tonawanda plant during the 2023 negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. Production of the drive units had not been launched there.

Mark Amodei (R-NV) did a 180 and supported the bill, having previously said that he will vote to preserve 45X and 30D tax credits.
Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.
The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth.
Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade.
According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers.","Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed what's been dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”, with the legislation designed to leverage deep cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits to pay for tax cuts, immigration enforcement and extra spending on defense. The contentious bill is now headed for the Senate, where it faces its final test, with all Democrats but only a handful of GOP lawmakers critical of the huge increase it will bring to the national debt. According to a recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the bill, coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%.

According to the report, doing away with the IRA would eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted if the bill were to become law. Under normal circumstances, this fact alone would be enough to galvanize GOP lawmakers in those states to oppose the bill; however, just two Republican House reps joined the Democrats in voting against the bill, portending a similar fate for the bill in the Senate. Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.”

According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs. Similarly, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) did a 180 and supported the bill, having previously said that he will vote to preserve 45X and 30D tax credits. Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face a massive setback under Trump’s bill. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest-growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth. In effect, the bill would terminate both investment and production credits for renewable energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after it becomes law or those that enter service after 2028. Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade. Further, clean energy projects will be ineligible to claim the tax credits if they source basic materials such as cobalt and lithium for batteries, as well as glass for solar panels, from prohibited foreign entities such as China. According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers. OSHA estimates that ~70% of the residential solar industry employs lease arrangements.

Among the bill’s other key highlights are a proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's budget to $4.2B from $9.1B, the EPA’s smallest budget in nearly 40 years. The Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that shuttering the EPA's scientific arm would essentially turn the EPA into a purely political agency. If passed, the U.S. will record a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 billion metric tons annually over the next decade and U.S. household energy costs by ~$415 per household per year. The bill will also kill off the budding clean hydrogen, CO2 management, and even the nuclear power sectors.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy.","When the Senate returns from recess next week, it will have Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” to contend with. There’s no doubt the chamber will try to make changes to the omnibus plan to extend and expand Trump’s tax cuts that passed the House last week. The president even told reporters over the weekend that senators should “make the changes they want to make,” and that some of the changes “maybe are something I’d agree with, to be honest.”

Whether those changes include salvaging the nation’s clean energy tax credits will likely depend on a small group of Republican senators who have criticized the House’s near-total gutting of the subsidies and how much they are willing to fight to undo it.

The bill that passed the House would outright eliminate consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and both energy efficiency renovations and new energy-efficient homes. It would also kill the clean hydrogen tax credit at the end of this year and give most zero-carbon power plants, including wind, solar, and geothermal, an end-of-year deadline to start construction, among many other damaging provisions.

To date, at least eight Senate Republicans have spoken out against at least some of these changes, but none of them have tied their vote to the issue. The pressure to stick with your party is “enormous” when your vote is the difference between a bill’s success or failure, Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy at Third Way, told me. “As we saw in the House, the biggest question is whether any Republican Senator, when push comes to shove, has any willingness to try to stop this bill in order to defend energy tax credits.”

Pay attention to what they say over the next few weeks — and when they say it. It’s one thing to speak out when everything’s still up in the air. It’s quite another to keep talking when votes are on the line.

The Letter Writers

When the budget fight was first heating up in April, four senators led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune warning that repealing the tax credits “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The three co-authors were Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Last week, after the House modified its proposal to phase out the tax credits more aggressively, Murkowski told Politico the Senate was “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.” The moderate Republican has a history of supporting environmental policy, and has already broken with her party on at least one vote this year. In February, she was the only Republican who voted in favor of a Democrat-led effort to reinstate 5,500 federal public lands employees that had been fired by the Department of Government Efficiency. (The legislation failed.) Murkowski has also gone her own way to support more efficient energy codes, loans for electric vehicle manufacturers, and the impeachment of President Trump over the January 6 insurrection. But she did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and if you look at her overall voting record, these occasions of deviating from the party line have been rare.

Tillis, who is a member of the Finance Committee and will therefore be directly involved in writing the tax credit portion of the bill, has made more specific comments. He said he would push to wind down the tax credits more slowly to give businesses more time to prepare. “We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.

While Tillis does not have the same kind of track record as Murkowski, he’s up for re-election next year, and his state has a lot to lose. Some 34 clean energy projects worth $20 billion in investment and tied to more than 17,000 jobs came to North Carolina because of the tax credits, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. Toyota invested in an EV battery manufacturing plant and just started production last month. Several EV charger manufacturers are setting up shop in the state. Siemens Energy is building a factory to make large power transformers, equipment that is essential to expanding the grid and is currently in very tight supply.

Susan Collins is also running again next year. While the Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom. The Maine Climate Labor Council, a coalition of unions, estimates there are 145 utility-scale clean energy projects that are either operating or in development that could be eligible for the tax credits. The state has also made a big energy efficiency push in recent years, with the tax credits supporting the expansion of efficiency jobs.

Although Collins did not ultimately vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, she was the only Republican to vote against an amendment proposed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah that would have cut funding for the law’s energy efficiency rebate programs.

The Come-Latelies

When it became clear that the House was considering changes that would effectively repeal the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia chimed in to voice their concerns. Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

After the bill passed the House, Jon Husted of Ohio decided it was time to speak up. “You have companies that have already made investments, made commitments,” he told the outlet NOTUS. “Supply chains have been built around them, and we need to phase that out more slowly. I think that they deserve to have at least five years of that credit.” Like Tillis, Husted has an election coming up — and 35 clean energy projects in his state to protect.

The Wild Cards

The D.C. insiders I spoke to mentioned a few other powerful senators who could play a role in the debate who’ve been mum on the IRA so far. Thune, of South Dakota, has a history of being friendly toward tax credits for wind energy, and was honored by the American Council on Renewable Energy for his support for renewable energy in 2019. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Budget Committee, has also long been a sometimes-ally for climate action in the Senate. His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.

Then there are the potential spoilers. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on the bill in order to send it back to the House and ultimately to the President’s desk, and the party has already split into a number of factions looking for various tweaks. Some, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, oppose the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said they will push to reduce spending even more.

In the House, defenders of the tax credits ultimately cared more about raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction than fighting for clean energy subsidies. We could see a similar dynamic play out in the Senate, where Murkowski and Collins have also expressed concern about cuts to Medicaid. The Senate also can’t afford to change the bill so much that it will lose support in the House, so any changes will have to be surgical. The calculation will be, “What is the smallest thing that the authors of the bill can give these folks to fall back into line so that it is relatively easy to both pass the Senate and then get back through the House?” Freed explained.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy. The North Dakota Senator wrote a letter to Republican leaders in early May railing against the “indefinite entitlement” given to energy sources that depend on the wind and sun, and arguing that the tax credits should prioritize electricity generators on the basis of “reliability,” so as to encourage “geothermal, hydropower, coal and natural gas with carbon capture, and nuclear without excluding wind and solar.”

Capito has barely made a fuss about the energy credits, but she and Cramer will be the ones to watch to see how the Senate deals with the bill’s provision to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, as both sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Capito is the chair. The repeal may not be allowed under the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, as it doesn’t have a direct effect on the federal budget. The Senate Parliamentarian hasn’t yet weighed in, but a negative ruling did not stop the two Republicans from leading the fight to revoke waivers granted to California that allowed it to set pollution limits on cars and trucks.

In the end, if any of these Senators wants to take a stand for big changes to the tax credits, they are going to need at least three colleagues to stick it out with them. A more likely outcome, Freed told me, is for them to attempt some smaller adjustments.

“Hopefully they can make it better, but they’re also under enormous pressure to not deviate too significantly from what the House wrote,” he said. “We just need to go in clear-eyed that it's going to be difficult.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMyODQxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjUwNjk0OX0.pFEmdhqvdhuc8AnllM_I2iiJKWEUSmxdOJG2nF51SRA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C200,N,,2025-05-27 20:05:01.223539

However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt.","EGLE hosts tour during Mackinac Policy Conference to showcase the impact of water infrastructure investments

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich.—Today, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) Director Phil Roos joined state and local leaders during the Mackinac Policy Conference to highlight the $78.7 million Mackinac Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Improvement Project. The event featured a tour of the plant and an update on construction progress, emphasizing how the state’s continued investment in water infrastructure benefits communities, creates jobs and protects Michigan’s world-class water resources.

Originally constructed in 1970, the Mackinac Island WWTP has undergone significant upgrades to accommodate the island's growing population and tourism demands. The WWTP, which serves a population ranging from 492 in the winter to over 20,000 in the summer, previously struggled to meet environmental and capacity standards. The upgraded plant will provide better wastewater treatment, expand capacity and improve water quality on the island, ultimately supporting sustainable growth.

""Investing in water infrastructure is critical to ensuring the health and safety of Michigan’s communities,"" said Director Roos. ""This project is a shining example of how strategic investments in our water systems provide long-term benefits for both residents and visitors, while also contributing to Michigan’s ongoing efforts to improve water quality.""

The WWTP Improvement Project aims to expand and modernize the wastewater treatment plant, with major upgrades like automated screening, grit removal and advanced treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors and UV disinfection. Expanded capacity will allow the plant to handle seasonal surges in wastewater, while new pumps, blowers and controls will improve water quality and stormwater management. Collaboration between EGLE, Mackinac Island and the Mackinac State Historic Parks was essential to securing additional property for expanding the WWTP footprint.

""We appreciate the support the community has received from the EGLE State Revolving fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations for our new Wastewater Treatment Plant,"" said Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud. ""The project is a critical need for the Island’s infrastructure. This will be a great improvement to the Mackinac Island Community that all will greatly benefit from. We would like to thank everyone involved for supporting our beautiful Island, a true Gem, which is enjoyed by many and will be for generations to come.""

The Mackinac Island WWTP upgrade was made possible through a combination of funding sources, including a $24 million Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) loan, a $15 million American Rescue Plan (ARP) grant and a $39.7 million state appropriation grant in 2023. These funds will allow the facility to implement wastewater treatment processes and ensure more efficient and environmentally responsible operations.

""Infrastructure projects on Mackinac Island are not cheap, nor are they easy. However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt. ""Without the assistance of EGLE State Revolving Fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations, the residents of the City of Mackinac Island would be unable to support these much-needed system updates. I thank everyone who has come together to support Mackinac Island as the special place it is not only to our local community, but to the entire State of Michigan.""

Governor Whitmer’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 Executive Recommendation Budget continues to build on these investments, providing $50 million in one-time funds to support lead service line replacement and upgrades to water systems. Additionally, $30 million in annual funding will be directed to support lead service line replacements, stormwater management and wastewater infrastructure improvements. Another $5.95 million is dedicated to strengthening the implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure safe water for all Michigan families.

""There is immense public value in making low-interest loans available for local communities to upgrade their water systems,"" said State Representative Parker Fairbairn, R-Harbor Springs. ""The Clean Water State Revolving Fund helps to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams and thereby safeguards public health. This program allows them the resources to make critical and sometimes overdue updates to their infrastructure. The Revolving Fund gives communities the flexibility to make these necessary investments without having to pay much higher interest rates of commercially available loans.""

Since 2019, the Whitmer-Gilchrist administration has invested more than $5.3 billion in water infrastructure projects, including lead service line replacement and water quality improvements. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to ensure all Michigan communities have access to safe, clean drinking water.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/EGLE-Logos/Social.jpg?rev=fa9af8ebc6cc48f4ab7777c144d928b5&hash=AD089C78988ABC2E4DD23E2D36B9B8E6,N,,2025-05-28 01:02:15.042451

BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.
""But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.""","US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise.

Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space.

First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever.

""The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs,"" BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand.""

In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024.

Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks.

""Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,"" BlackRock wrote. ""Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think.""

BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.

""Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers,"" BlackRock wrote. ""But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.""",https://i.insider.com/6835ed53c6ad288d1481f335?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 23:01:35.431419

Gamechanger for Micromobility

The Fiat Tris is a three-wheel electric vehicle designed by engineers at the Stellantis brand’s design studio in Turin, Italy. Initially introduced in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, the compact EV has a range of just above 55 miles per charge and can be recharged by any standard domestic socket.

The company believes the ultra-light commercial vehicle can be a game-changer for micromobility, and it’s available in three different configurations: chassis-cabin, flatbed, and pick-up to suit applications such as urban logistics, last-mile delivery, mobile businesses, and essential transportation services.

Fiat’s First 3-Wheel Design

The Tris is the first three-wheel vehicle Fiat has brought to market. It has an integrated charging system as well as a 220-V plug to simplify recharging. Using a standard domestic plug, the Tris can be charged from 0% to 80% in 3.5 hours, or completely recharged in 4 hours and 40 minutes. According to the company, professionals can recharge the vehicle overnight or between shifts.

The Tris is 10.4 feet long and has a tight 10-foot turning radius. The vehicle is designed to navigate narrow city streets. The cargo area has 2.25 square meters of load space and can accommodate a standard 1,200 mm x 800 mm euro pallet. The Tris weighs about 2,200 pounds and has a payload capacity that maxes out at 1,190 pounds.

Future Expansion

Olivier Francois, FIAT CEO and Stellantis Global CMO, says the Tris will give independent workers, small businesses, and underserved communities a cost-effective, zero-emissions tool to move forward. Francois says the vehicle could ""transform last-mile mobility” in the MEA region and even teased that the Tris could be introduced next to the European market.

Fiat expects to manufacture the Tris in Morocco, where the brand has a significant manufacturing footprint.

The New York Times said that the EPA is proposing a regulation that would eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

Big changes could come to the power industry.

“This is something that has gone back and forth for over a decade at this point,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

The New York Times said that the EPA is proposing a regulation that would eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

According to the Times’ reporting, the EPA claims greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning power plants, “aren’t contributing significantly to dangerous pollution”.

“The idea that ... power plants don’t make up a significant enough portion of global warming causing pollutants is astounding and just downright wrong,” Gary said.

The EPA said electric power is the second largest human source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. In Kentucky, the power industry is the number one human source of greenhouse gases, according to the EPA.

“Kentucky, because it is more reliance on fossil fuels for its generation of power than most other states, it does rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

Biden era regulations, that went into effect in 2024, said existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants must control 90% of their carbon pollution over the next few years. Dependable Power First Kentucky, a coalition concerned about Kentucky’s energy grid, said those regulations aren’t realistic.

“It would have raised all the consumers’ prices. The price everyone paid to turn on the lights would have went up; but also, it’s not just that, it’s the reliability. We just don’t have the energy infrastructure to do that, and the lights just wouldn’t have come on at times,” said Corey Elder, acting executive director for Dependable Power First Kentucky.

Elder said the EPA’s new proposal is a relief for Kentucky power plants.

“Our top priority is just ensuring that the American people have reliable electricity and what this rule does is it gives our power producers more time to get there,” Elder said.

But moving away from fossil fuels altogether, the Kentucky Resources Council said, would help with the negative effects of climate change.

“It will also be more affordable and sustainable for Kentuckians. We’re just kicking the can down the road by not tackling this problem now,” Gary said.

The EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency will make sure all Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy.

Spectrum News 1 reached out to the EPA to see what exactly it’s proposing. A spokesperson said the EPA is developing the proposed rule and it will be published once it has an interagency review and is signed by the administrator.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP19023814163567_crop,N,,2025-05-27 19:07:38.969168

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

The Golden State boasts that nearly 30% of new car sales are electric, compared to under 10% in New York. “They’ve met their transportation goals several years in advance,” said Michael Lerner from the nonprofit Energy Vision research group. “They met their most recent target three years early.”

In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said. But despite 96 Assembly cosponsors, the legislation has stalled in the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, Woerner acknowledged.

“There are some environmental groups that are really convinced that eliminating internal combustion engines is the only path to achieving our climate goals,” Woerner said.",https://www.cnyhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/05/GettyImages-954558336-e1715959219184_79f904.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-27 21:01:33.416191
