Austin-based Base Power just raised $1 billion to bring its massive home batteries to homes across the nation. The company has already installed more than 100 megawatt-hours of battery capacity in Texas since launching in 2023, an impressive feat in a state known for its power grid challenges.

Base Power's business model is truly unique. Instead of selling expensive systems that can cost homeowners tens of thousands of dollars, the company leases out its batteries. Customers pay an upfront fee, ranging from $695 to $995, for installation, and a small monthly payment of $19 or $29, depending on the battery size.

Those batteries aren't small, either. The 25-kilowatt-hour model is twice as powerful as a Tesla Powerwall, and the 50-kilowatt-hour option can keep an average home powered for up to 48 hours on its own.

Here's how it works: customers commit to buying their electricity from Base Power at 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour for three years. In return, the company can tap into those batteries to sell power back to the grid during peak times. This move helps stabilize Texas's often-strained power network and earns rewards from the state's utility regulator.

By working with Base Power, homeowners get reliable backup power without the costs usually associated with setting up a new system, and the company helps the grid handle demand much more efficiently. That means less reliance on dirty energy sources like gas and coal, along with fewer power outages when it matters most.

With this new round of funding, Base Power plans to expand beyond the Lone Star State and build a second U.S. battery factory. Its first facility, on the outskirts of Austin, is already under construction.

The approach follows a growing trend in clean energy tech, helping people save money and reducing pollution. If successful, Base Power might do for home batteries what solar leases did for rooftop panels — make clean, reliable energy a standard feature in American homes.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Base-Powerimage-recfidAaLZ8JOEjCL-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 14:06:32.309256

While XCF Global may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, XCF Global specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.","XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") was featured in a white paper titled, ""Unlocking the Full Value of Renewable Fuel Facilities: Powering the Future with Posh Flex Gensets"" written by Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator. As previously announced, XCF and Posh have signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to explore deploying Posh's Flex Gensets at our New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's white paper provides its economic and technical roadmap for integrating Posh Energy's Flex Gensets into SAF and renewable diesel (""RD"") facilities, such as at XCF's New Rise Reno facility. Posh's analysis shows how producers using its Flex Gensets process can convert propane-rich byproduct streams, typically ~8% of total output, into renewable electricity, transforming a flared or low-value stream into a source of zero-carbon power.

Further, the white paper demonstrates how integrating Posh Flex Gensets into SAF and RD production may be able to deliver both economic and environmental benefits today, while advancing the industry's trajectory toward eSAF and fuels with near-zero - or even negative - carbon intensity (""CI"").

From Byproducts to Profits

The white paper highlights how incorporating Posh's Flex Gensets at facilities such as XCF's New Rise Reno facility has the potential to turn SAF and renewable fuel facilities into integrated energy hubs, producing not only renewable fuel but also clean power and food-grade CO₂. The result is the opportunity to create diversified revenue streams, stronger credit generation, and measurable margin growth.

By replacing grid power with on-site renewable electricity, producers have the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), boost Section 45Z and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, and strengthen energy resilience for both operations and power grids.

In addition to enhancing the value of its renewable fuels, the white paper illustrates that integrating Posh's Flex Gensets has the potential to deliver:

Improvement in operating margin, driven by electricity sales and eligibility for the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit

Additional revenue streams through the sale of biogenic, food-grade CO₂ with market prices as high as $700 per metric ton, equating to approximately $0.22 per gallon of added value

Up to 80% higher electrical efficiency and near-zero local emissions

Advancing XCF's Growth Model

The white paper builds on the LOI signed in September 2025, which outlines plans for a 100 kW pilot deployment of Posh's Flex Gensets at the New Rise Reno facility, followed by a modular scale-up to 10 MW of installed capacity.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

The metals are crucial for high-tech devices, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and U.S. military technology.

Trump is set to host a summit and dinner with officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The summit comes a week after Trump returned to Washington from a trip to Asia, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss the export of rare earth elements, which was a key point of friction in their trade negotiations.

Beijing recently expanded export restrictions over vital rare earth elements and magnets before announcing -- after Trump-Xi talks in South Korea -- that China would delay its new restrictions by one year.

Washington is now looking for new ways to circumvent China on critical minerals. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earth mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

In a Truth Social post, Trump had said he and Xi had ""a truly great"" meeting. He also said China agreed to continue the flow of rare earth and critical minerals ""openly and freely.""

There is enormous respect between our two Countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place. We agreed on many things, with others, even of high importance, being very close to resolved,"" Trump wrote on October 30.

I was extremely honored by the fact that President Xi authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products. Our Farmers will be very happy!

China has agreed to allow chips to be exported for cars, at least temporarily averting the crisis

Car factories worldwide will operate normally for a little longer thanks to a détente in a microchip dispute between China and the Netherlands. The news comes shortly after the spat caused its first real consequences, with Nissan announcing a slowdown in manufacturing of its most popular product, the Rogue compact SUV.

CNN reports, “China has agreed to allow the export of chips critical to auto production, averting widespread shutdowns that had been predicted by the industry.”

The country threatened to pause chip exports after the Dutch government took control of a microchip company owned by a Chinese conglomerate.

That had automakers worldwide seeking alternative supplies of chips — alternatives that largely don’t exist. Reuters reported Tuesday that Nissan had plans to cut Rogue production due to a shortage of chips. It looked like the first of what could be many dominoes to fall.

The New York Times explains, “Some industry insiders have drawn parallels of the current situation to the shortages after economies around the world shut down during the coronavirus pandemic,” sending new car prices soaring.

Cars Need a Unique Type of Chip

High-tech products the world over use powerful microchips, but cars tend to use simple ones

Few companies still build the older, lower-tech chips that dominate car production

The crisis began in mid-October, when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, a company that provides more than 40% of the microchips used in global auto production.

The government of the Netherlands reacted to concerns that the company’s Chinese owners were going to shut down chip production in Europe and move it home to China. China increasingly controls much of the global microchip trade, creating a possible chokepoint that could let it influence worldwide industries.

In response to the move, China threatened to stop the export of the chips.

There is a global microchip industry, but today’s cars need a highly specific product. The chip industry doesn’t produce many of these cheap, low-power microchips based on older technology.

Most high-tech industries today require complex, high-powered chips that can perform millions of functions simultaneously. Devices like phones and laptop computers run off just one or two of those. Cars, however, need dozens of weak, older-tech chips that each control just one or two functions, like raising and lowering windows or controlling engine timing.

Nexperia is one of the few companies still making those, which makes it a crucial cog in the global auto industry.

Automakers Moving Toward Newer Tech

In the long run, many automakers plan to move to more powerful, more common chips

The auto industry has a long-term solution to the problem, if not a short-term answer.

Startup electric vehicle (EV) builder Rivian has pioneered a leaner design approach, which uses just a handful of powerful chips like those found in phones to control all aspects of a car’s operation. Giant Volkswagen made a $5 billion investment in Rivian to get access to the technology for its own future designs.

General Motors last month announced plans for a new vehicle architecture powered by a single, ultra-powerful microprocessor.

But, today, building most cars remains dependent on a plentiful supply of 1980s-style microchips. Global trade in those will not pause in the short run. But China and the Netherlands are still meeting to iron out their differences, so the situation could change.",https://dam.coxautoinc.com/asset/7849dda9-b2fe-4821-a223-a221f4021822/OG/honda-indiana-auto-plant-2026-cr-v-and-civic-overhead.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 14:07:11.371059

The rapid growth of AI is driving a major surge in electricity demand in the United States, reshaping how and where new energy infrastructure is built.

This boom risks deepening energy inequality as millions of American households already struggle to afford basic energy needs.

Effective regulation can help overcome these challenges by ensuring large energy users cover their costs, shielding low-income customers from datacenter driven rate hikes while advancing clean, equitable power.

Artificial intelligence is driving a massive technological transformation that is already reshaping many aspects of daily life. The AI industry is expected to grow a staggering 42 percent and become a $1.3 trillion market by 2030. The backbone of this boom takes the form of massive “hyper-scale” data centers that are consuming electricity on a scale that rivals entire cities. As the US positions itself as a global AI leader, US tech companies are pouring millions of dollars into new and larger facilities that can meet their growing demand. The operation of these data centers requires in turn the rapid — and expensive — expansion of ratepayer funded generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.[1]

On its own, the buildout of this energy infrastructure to supply AI might not be so controversial. But it comes at a time when more than 33 million US households — or one in four households in the US — face energy insecurity,[2] struggling to pay utility bills or to heat or cool their homes. The juxtaposition between the energy haves and have nots is glaring. Moreover, as detailed below, the buildout may exacerbate energy insecurity as some of the associated costs are passed onto households least able to afford them. This blog explores how policymakers can leverage the rapid growth of AI to improve energy equity and affordability, particularly for energy insecure households, rather than having it compound the problem of energy inequality in the US.

Rising rates and the question of how to protect consumers

The question of who should pay for the new energy infrastructure needed to meet data center demand remains an open one. Thus far, it appears that residential consumers in regions where data centers are located, including many who are already energy insecure, are footing much of the bill. In some of these regions, monthly wholesale electricity rates have increased as much as 267 percent compared to five years ago, leaving many residents struggling to understand why their bills were rising exponentially and how they would pay for it. But the lack of transparency in the ratemaking process makes it difficult to assess the extent to which residential customers are paying more than their fair share for infrastructure development that primarily benefits the data centers.

These data center–driven electricity price hikes have certainly raised eyebrows. In Virginia, for example, often dubbed the data center capital of the world, they were a major factor in this year’s gubernatorial election, and the candidate who advocated for making data centers pay their fair share — Democrat Abigail Spanberger — won by a wide margin. In many states, regulators have taken action to try to protect residential consumers. The public utility company AEP Ohio, for example, paused new data center approvals in that state until the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio can resolved who should pay for necessary transmission upgrades and guarantee payments for projected electricity demand. Yet even as states experiment with different approaches to ensure the equitable distribution of costs and burdens, the rapid pace of AI growth calls for replicable and scalable policy pathways.

Should policymakers and regulators decide to ensure that the AI boom strengthens rather than inhibits energy equity, the following four policy levers could be crucial.

1. Protect ratepayers from unfair cost burdens

Regulators can direct utilities to ensure that the costs of expanding the grid to accommodate energy-intensive data centers are distributed fairly, so that AI tech companies do not end up socializing their infrastructure costs onto residential ratepayers. Nevada offers a promising precedent. The recently approved Clean Transition Tariff (CTT) would make Google responsible for 100 percent of the costs of the new generation it requires in that state — protecting other ratepayers from higher bills. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, utilities are pushing for data centers to pay their fair share for grid usage instead of avoiding interconnection costs through co-location agreements. These approaches can shield low- and middle-income households from datacenter driven rate hikes.

2. Expand protections for low-income households

States can strengthen or adopt low-income rate classes designed to insulate vulnerable customers from rising energy costs through discounts. Those that already have such rate classes in place, such as Massachusetts, can include new protections preventing across-the-board tariff hikes driven by data center energy demand. Those that don’t have them yet can consider putting them in place in ways that account for AI-related rate hikes. This can help target energy assistance more efficiently and channel the benefits of clean energy investments through on-bill credits.

3. Ensure equitable siting and clean generation

The pace of data center construction is fueling renewed interest in gas-fired power plants and even restarting nuclear facilities. But siting new fossil fuel plants near already overburdened communities — such as those in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” or parts of Virginia — risks worsening pollution and public health disparities, and has already generated public opposition. An equity-focused siting policy begins with a simple principle: do no harm. That means prioritizing renewable energy sources, avoiding fossil development near vulnerable populations, and ensuring that new infrastructure investments do not exacerbate environmental injustices.

4. Unlock local benefits from data centers

Clean energy–powered data centers can also create shared value for surrounding communities. In Europe, companies such as Meta and Google are already doing this by, for instance, recycling waste heat from their Danish and Finnish data centers to warm nearby homes. Similar in-kind energy transfers could directly benefit underserved US communities. For example, excess heat or generated energy from data centers could be repurposed for affordable housing complexes, hospitals, or schools—providing tangible energy savings and community benefits.

The energy challenges of AI are often framed in terms of reliability and capacity — how to keep the lights on as electricity demand surges. But the deeper challenge is one of distribution: who pays, who benefits, and who is left behind? As the US positions itself as a leader in AI, policymakers and industry leaders have a unique opportunity to turn AI’s energy needs into an opportunity to promote equity, protect vulnerable communities, and accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future.

[1] For example, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) predicts that due in large measure to the expansion of data centers, Texas’ electricity demand will double by 2030, requiring it to add 67 gigawatts of generation in the next 5 years — the equivalent of powering 60 million homes.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image_How-AI-Growth-Can-Hyper-Scale-Energy-Equity-and-Affordability.png,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:48.477100

Circularity is no longer optional; it's a regulatory, environmental and economic imperative,"" per a World Economic Forum report.","Finnish technology company Coolbrook has made a breakthrough in plastics recycling by using its electrified RotoDynamicReactor to crack 100% plastic-waste-derived pyrolysis oil into useful olefins such as ethylene and propylene, according to a Team 10+ report.

Coolbrook's tests were conducted in conjunction with the EU Horizon Europe program's Electro project, which looks to demonstrate new technologies linking plastic waste with the petrochemical industry to make the production of olefins used in plastics more sustainable.

The company's RDR technology is designed to achieve 100% carbon dioxide-free olefin production using renewable energy sources, which could be a game-changer for the petrochemical industry and plastics recycling.

Steam cracking is a process that breaks down saturated hydrocarbons, in this case pyrolysis oils, into smaller, often unsaturated hydrocarbons. Coolbrook says its technology does this more efficiently than traditional methods, without the need for dirty fuels, and with a higher selectivity of light olefins, which are highly valued.

Less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, with much of it ending up in landfills that generate planet-warming methane and leach chemicals and microplastics into the environment, where they can harm plants, animals, and humans.

The Electro project uses new technology to pre-treat plastic waste, providing a feedstock for Coolbrook's RDR, which produces circular materials for reintroduction into the plastics manufacturing sector.

The scalable concept has an initial life cycle assessment showing a 90% reduction in planet-warming pollution over the best available technology being used today.

These efforts support the European Union's objective that all packaging be recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030 and decrease the use of virgin material to reach climate neutrality by 2050.

The introduction of plastic-free alternatives has already begun, but plastics have been interwoven in society enough to make their elimination a difficult task.

The automotive industry accounts for around 12-15% of global plastic demand, and the increased adoption of electric vehicles will push that figure up because of the high mechanical strength and light weight of certain plastics and fiber-reinforced composites that aid in extending vehicle range.

Because of this, the EU will require 20% recycled plastic in new vehicles within six years of the new regulation's implementation, with a bump to 25% in 10 years.

""Without scalable recycling solutions, the industry risks creating a new wave of waste. Circularity is no longer optional; it's a regulatory, environmental and economic imperative,"" per a World Economic Forum report.

According to Team 10+, Coolbrook has also successfully cracked naphtha — another petroleum product used in plastics — at its pilot plant, which shows the versatility of its technology and its potential to revolutionize other parts of the petrochemical industry.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/plastics-recyclingimage-recbn2eOmLhAZZicG-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 14:06:40.652953

Global energy storage capacity is expected to grow tenfold by the end of the decade.","Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly in advanced talks with Samsung SDI for a $2.1 billion battery deal. This shows Tesla’s push for long-term access to cutting-edge battery technology. The deal will likely focus on cylindrical battery cells. It could boost Tesla’s supply chain as the company increases electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage production.

If finalized, the agreement would make Samsung SDI one of Tesla’s key suppliers alongside Panasonic and LG Energy Solution. Samsung batteries might power the EV maker’s new models and energy storage systems, such as the Powerwall and Megapack.

Tesla’s battery demand continues to rise with expanding production at Gigafactories in the U.S., Germany, and China. The company delivered over 1.8 million vehicles in 2024. With the new mass market compact EV coming, battery demand for Tesla may hit 400 GWh each year by 2030.

Why Tesla Needs More Battery Suppliers

Battery supply is the cornerstone of Tesla’s growth. The company’s 4680 cell production is moving more slowly than expected. This limits its ability to meet internal demand fully. As a result, Tesla continues to rely on external suppliers to meet its EV and storage targets.

The chart shows the EV giant’s most recent storage deployments. It reached almost 45 GW in the third quarter of 2025.

Samsung SDI supplies cylindrical cells to BMW and Rivian. The company is also expanding its manufacturing in South Korea, the U.S., and Europe. Tesla can partner with Samsung to diversify its sourcing. This way, it can access high-energy-density, nickel-rich batteries. These batteries improve driving range and performance.

This deal would also help Tesla reduce its exposure to raw material price swings. Battery-grade lithium and nickel prices fell by over 40% in 2024. However, volatility is still high because global demand for energy storage is rising fast.

The Global Battery Boom: A Trillion-Dollar Charge

The global battery market is expanding at a record pace. According to BloombergNEF, annual battery demand could exceed 4,500 GWh by 2035, compared to around 950 GWh in 2024. Electric vehicles account for most of this growth, with stationary storage and grid applications contributing an increasing share.

China remains the largest producer, led by CATL and BYD, which together control over 50% of global battery supply. However, competition from South Korea and Japan is growing. Companies like Samsung SDI and Panasonic are investing billions in new factories in the U.S. and Europe.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a key driver of this shift. It provides tax credits for batteries and EVs made locally. This encourages foreign suppliers to set up production in North America. Samsung SDI is already building new facilities in Indiana and Tennessee, both of which could supply Tesla in the future.

Innovation at Full Voltage: From 4680 to Solid-State

The Tesla–Samsung deal aligns with broader trends in battery chemistry. Samsung SDI is working on high-nickel NCA and NCM cells. They are also looking at solid-state batteries. These batteries could offer better safety and higher energy density.

Tesla has focused heavily on innovation through its 4680 cells, designed to lower costs by 50% per kWh and improve vehicle range. However, scaling production has been challenging. By combining internal development with supplier deals, Tesla is able to stay flexible as battery technologies evolve.

Meanwhile, global research is exploring alternatives like lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for cost savings. It’s also looking into solid-state batteries for better performance in the future.

Analysts predict that commercial solid-state cells will enter mass production between 2028 and 2030. This timing matches Tesla’s future model plans.

The Broader Battery Market: Growth and Challenges

Battery storage has become central to the global clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that installed battery capacity could jump from about 20 GW in 2020 to over 1,200 GW by 2030 in net-zero scenarios.

BloombergNEF expects 2025 to add 92 GW of new grid-scale storage. This shows how quickly the sector is growing. By 2030, global investment in batteries—across EVs, homes, and the grid—could exceed $1 trillion cumulatively.

Still, the industry faces several headwinds. Supply chain risks for critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt remain high. Recycling capacity also lags behind growing demand. Governments and automakers are now working to create closed-loop supply chains to recover metals and reduce environmental impacts.

In this landscape, Tesla’s influence remains large. The company’s early push for vertical integration—mining, refining, cell production, and energy storage—has set the pace for other automakers and battery firms.

Tesla’s Expanding Battery Network and Market Influence

Tesla’s collaboration with Samsung SDI is one of many major supply deals the company has formed in recent years. It has strong partnerships with Panasonic for 2170 cells and CATL for LFP batteries. These are used in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China.

In 2024, Tesla signed new deals with LG Energy Solution. These agreements provide more high-nickel cells. This supports Tesla’s expanding Megapack energy storage production in California.

Tesla’s global footprint in energy storage has also expanded sharply. The company’s Energy Generation and Storage division reported a 60% increase in deployment in 2024 than the previous year.

And as seen in the first chart above, it skyrocketed to over 40 GW in Q3 2025. Its Megapack systems are now used by utilities in the U.S., U.K., and Australia to stabilize power grids and support renewable integration.

Beyond its partnerships, Tesla plays a defining role in shaping global battery trends. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada led the way in large-scale lithium-ion production. Meanwhile, the Texas and Berlin plants are placing Tesla at the heart of EV battery innovation in the West.

Tesla has driven scale, standardization, and efficiency. This helped make batteries cheaper for everyone. Pack prices dropped from about $1,100 per kWh in 2010 to under $140 in 2024, says BNEF.

As more nations set targets for carbon neutrality by 2050, battery demand will continue to surge. Tesla’s push to secure long-term supply through deals like the one with Samsung SDI ensures it remains a dominant force in this transformation.

The company’s reach goes beyond cars. It also impacts energy infrastructure, manufacturing systems, and the global clean energy economy.

The chart shows that global battery supply is projected to rise sharply through 2030, driven by massive factory expansions across China, the U.S., and Europe. In contrast, Tesla’s battery demand grows at a steadier pace, reflecting its focus on efficiency and diversified supplier partnerships rather than pure volume growth.

Outlook: Securing Supply, Scaling Sustainability

If the $2.1 billion deal with Samsung SDI moves forward, Tesla will strengthen its supply resilience and technological edge. The agreement shows a bigger industry trend: Automakers are forming key partnerships because demand for EVs and storage batteries is rising fast.

Global energy storage capacity is expected to grow tenfold by the end of the decade. With battery innovation speeding up, Tesla’s strategy of multi-sourcing and co-developing advanced chemistries could be key to maintaining its leadership.

Whether through partnerships, in-house innovation, or scaling renewable energy integration, Tesla continues to help define the direction of the global battery industry.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2175976435.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:25.075111

Clean energy companies, consumers and other environmental groups also lobbied directly for the bill.
The IRP would be overseen by the Illinois Commerce Commission in consultation with the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Finance Authority, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and utilities.
The changes also carve out a Storage for All program to help income-eligible residents access solar energy storage.
Although Denzler said the group does want to see more battery storage, the issue is how it will be financed.","Illinois’ General Assembly passed a package of comprehensive energy reforms last week that would help the state reach its clean energy goals and aims to lower prices for consumers.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act will add battery storage to community solar projects and fund improvements to energy grid infrastructure that advocacy groups say would cost-effectively help the state meet its goal of transitioning to renewable energy by 2050.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who expressed support for the bill in the past, is expected to sign it into law.

“We don’t want to be in the position that we were this year, where we were passing a bill in response to rising energy bills. We want our state to be in a position where we are adjusting energy policy along the way so that we’re not having to have those situations in the first place,” said Kady McFadden, lead strategist and lobbyist for the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, who worked with policy experts to advocate for CRGA.

The coalition includes environmental organizations, businesses and consumer advocates. Clean energy companies, consumers and other environmental groups also lobbied directly for the bill.

This summer, customers of Commonwealth Edison Co.—the largest electric utility in Illinois—faced a 10 to 15 percent rate increase following pricey energy auctions held by the regional electric grid operators that serve Illinois. Customers of Ameren, the state’s second-largest electric utility, saw spikes of 18 to 22 percent. Power-hungry data centers are helping drive that surge.

The CRGA Act was introduced during the spring legislative session by state Rep. Ann Williams, a Democrat representing Chicago’s North Side, but the bill never made it to a vote following disagreements over battery financing, data center regulations and lifting a moratorium on nuclear plant construction. Oil and gas industry groups lobbied against the measure.

But the bill reemerged during Illinois’ brief “veto session” in October. The act, which passed last Thursday, is an expansion of many of the clean energy provisions in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act that the General Assembly passed in 2021, which aim to reduce carbon emissions in the energy and transportation sectors.

Certain provisions in CRGA address energy efficiency, part of a comprehensive plan to contain demand on the electric grid. Notably, CRGA involves the development of a state integrated resource plan (IRP), which could help Illinois reduce skyrocketing wholesale power costs through rigorous energy modeling and consumer analysis.

The IRP would be overseen by the Illinois Commerce Commission in consultation with the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Finance Authority, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and utilities. The first IRP will be due to the commission no later than Nov. 15, 2026. The second will be due Sept. 30, 2029, with subsequent plans coming once every four years after that.

“There’s no guarantee that the planning will go in favor of renewable energy,” said Jennifer Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, which advocated for CRGA. “We think, with the data that we know is available, renewable energy is [the] most affordable source of energy when we’re thinking about new capacity. We feel pretty confident it’s going to go in our favor, but it’s not mandated to.”

Walling said the council is excited about smaller provisions of the bill as well, including a pilot for thermal energy networks that can share heating and cooling within multiple buildings; geothermal renewable energy credits; and natural gas efficiency.

Another provision of CRGA affects the Solar for All program, which gives income-eligible residents access to solar power either by subscribing to a community solar farm or, for homeowners, installing panels on their property at little or no cost.

The bill includes a number of small fixes to the Solar for All program to help it better reach eligible people, including in environmental justice communities. The changes also carve out a Storage for All program to help income-eligible residents access solar energy storage.

“One of the big parts of this bill is storage, and there’s no grid in the country in the next few years that is going to be truly resilient without battery storage,” said Kavi Chintam, campaign manager for Illinois at Vote Solar, who helped write some of the Solar for All language in the CRGA bill.

Over the past year, Chintam has worked with stakeholders and legislators to ensure CRGA provisions result in energy savings for Illinoisans, “and that we’re deploying clean energy in a way that is efficient and in a way that’s sufficient for meeting the moment right now with the increasing demand that data centers are bringing, and combating the federal attacks on clean energy that we’re seeing.”

Other components of the plan include providing ratepayers access to rebates to weatherize their homes, purchase efficient appliances and increase funds for low-income energy efficiency programs; launching a virtual power plant initiative to pool thousands of small solar and storage projects; and strengthening the power grid through improvements in infrastructure and grid-enhancing technologies, increasing the amount of clean energy that power lines can carry.

The bill’s effective date would be June 30, 2026. At that point, a short-term virtual power plant program for customers who already receive battery rebates would start up, Chintam said.

Among the bill’s detractors is the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, which said that CRGA would increase costs for consumers rather than control them, especially for manufacturers. The group particularly took issue with the IRP provision and the funding of battery storage.

“One of the fundamental disagreements that we have with advocates is they say that this is adding new capacity, and they claim that battery is capacity. Battery is not capacity, battery is not new generation, battery is storage,” said Mark Denzler, the group’s president and CEO.

Although Denzler said the group does want to see more battery storage, the issue is how it will be financed. He said that according to the Illinois Power Agency, the battery storage provision will cost an additional $7 billion, which will be paid by ratepayers. “We think when it comes to battery storage, they should use the Illinois Finance Authority, which provides low interest financing to bonds … which then doesn’t put the ratepayers on the hook, but makes the developers of battery storage have some skin in the game,” he said.

Denzler is also not happy that the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, will get through the IRP process “the ability to determine what Illinois’ energy mix will be … with really no oversight from the General Assembly.”

However, the group is happy about the CRGA nuclear moratorium provision, which lifts the remnants of a longstanding moratorium on nuclear power development. In 2023, Illinois partially repealed its long-standing moratorium on new nuclear units by allowing construction of new smaller reactors.

Denzler said the manufacturers’ association has four priorities to address energy issues: Keep the current fleets operating, extending the deadline of coal and other aging-plant shutdowns for energy transitions; add new generation, including nuclear, gas and renewable energy; invest in transmission lines; and further development of technology like battery storage and carbon capture and storage.

“We need an ‘all of the above’ approach to make sure that we have the energy to power the economy,” Denzler said. “There’s not a magic bullet that’s going to solve this problem.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-974537282.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:06:47.528058

Dive Brief:

The U.S. installed nearly 26 GW of new generation capacity between January and August 2025, up slightly from the approximately 23 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the most recent monthly infrastructure report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

As it has for most of the past two years, solar continued to dominate new generation resources, accounting for 2.7 GW out of 4 GW brought online in August alone, and 19 GW — about three-quarters — of generation capacity additions this year.

The report also says FERC reissued a certificate for Williams Companies to construct and operate its Northeast Supply Enhancement Project. That expansion of the Transco gas pipeline from New Jersey to New York was revived following talks between President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul in May after the Trump administration briefly froze the Empire Wind project. The White House and the developer of the wind project have told journalists the two sides reached a gas-for-wind deal, while Hochul has denied striking such a bargain.

Dive Insight:

The report shows momentum for renewables continuing, despite the federal government’s emphasis on fossil fuels and nuclear. FERC lists 136 GW of “high probability additions” through August 2028, with renewables, led by solar and followed by wind, accounting for nearly 84%. Natural gas accounts for about 15% of high probability additions.

“Notwithstanding impediments created by the Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, solar and wind continue to add more generating capacity than fossil fuels and nuclear power,” the Sun Day Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said in a statement. “And FERC foresees renewable energy’s role expanding in the next three years while the shares provided by coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear all contract.”

Large renewable projects that began operating in August include Hecate Energy’s 517-MW Outpost solar and storage project in Webb County, Texas; Gibson Solar’s 280-MW project in Gibson County, Indiana; and expansions at the Roadrunner Crossing Wind Farm in Eastland County, Texas, totaling 254 MW.

While solar and wind made up most of the new generation added in August, a number of smaller gas generators also came online that month, totaling 888 MW. They include: Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Co’s 248-MW A.B. Brown expansion project in Posey County, Indiana; Basin Electric Power Coop’s 245-MW Pioneer Generation Station expansion in Williams County, North Dakota; and Lower Colorado River Authority’s 188-MW Maxwell Peaker Plant in Caldwell County, Texas.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fT8jCHJY2vc1CIavlSZYwb6Ntrr9NM4C9AJVy_hJqEI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc193aW5kLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:52.309572

The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant has launched operations at its groundbreaking $3.5 billion Berkeley County facility, marking a pivotal moment in America's push for domestic critical minerals independence. This advanced recycling complex brings online sophisticated systems capable of processing 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, establishing a cornerstone of the nation's battery material supply chain infrastructure.

The South Carolina facility employs cutting-edge recovery technologies designed to extract lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper from end-of-life batteries with unprecedented efficiency. Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, who leads Redwood Materials, confirmed the facility's operational status whilst noting that the system has begun processing materials but has not yet reached full capacity utilisation.

Furthermore, combined with Redwood's existing Nevada operations that process 60,000 metric tons annually, the South Carolina plant elevates the company's total domestic processing capacity to 80,000 metric tons. This expansion represents one of the largest investments in critical minerals recovery infrastructure on American soil, positioning Redwood as a major force in reshaping how the United States sources essential battery materials.

Revolutionary Battery Materials Recovery Technology

The Berkeley County location provides significant logistical advantages for battery material collection and distribution throughout the southeastern United States. In addition, South Carolina's position within the automotive manufacturing corridor offers proximity to major vehicle assembly operations from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, creating efficient collection networks for end-of-life vehicle batteries.

The facility's strategic positioning enables cost-effective transportation links to both raw material sources and end customers. Interstate highway networks, rail connections, and port access facilitate the movement of recovered materials to industrial customers across multiple sectors. This infrastructure advantage becomes particularly valuable as Redwood expands its customer base beyond traditional automotive applications.

Consequently, regional economic development benefits extend beyond the immediate facility operations. The presence of advanced battery material processing attracts complementary manufacturing operations, creating a cluster effect that strengthens the broader clean technology ecosystem across the Southeast.

How Does Redwood Materials Transform Battery Waste Into Critical Resources?

Advanced Recovery Processes and Technologies

Redwood's proprietary processing methods combine hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical techniques to achieve industry-leading material recovery rates. The company has developed specialised systems that can handle various battery chemistries, from lithium-ion configurations used in electric vehicles to stationary storage applications with different material compositions.

The recovery process begins with mechanical dismantling and shredding of battery packs, followed by thermal treatment to separate metallic components from organic materials. Advanced chemical processing then purifies the recovered metals to battery-grade specifications. Quality control systems ensure that recovered lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper meet the stringent purity requirements needed for new battery manufacturing.

However, Redwood has declined to provide specific breakdowns of individual mineral recovery volumes at the South Carolina factory, maintaining proprietary aspects of their processing capabilities. This operational secrecy reflects the competitive nature of critical minerals processing and the value of maintaining technological advantages in recovery efficiency.

Circular Economy Integration Model

The company has established extensive collection networks spanning automotive manufacturers, electronics producers, and battery pack assemblers. These partnerships create feedstock streams that would otherwise contribute to landfill waste or require expensive primary mining operations to replace.

Straubel revealed that Redwood currently sells recovered critical minerals to approximately 20 to 30 companies across diverse industrial sectors. This customer base extends far beyond the electric vehicle market, encompassing aerospace manufacturers requiring cobalt-based high-performance alloys, stainless steel producers utilising recycled nickel, and speciality chemical companies incorporating recovered materials into industrial applications.

Furthermore, the circular model includes partnerships with mining companies that further process and refine Redwood's recovered materials. These relationships create additional value streams whilst ensuring that recycled materials meet the exact specifications required by end customers in various industrial applications.

Why Is Domestic Critical Minerals Production Strategically Important?

National Security and Supply Chain Resilience

Redwood's expansion occurs within a broader context of national security priorities focused on reducing American dependence on foreign critical mineral sources. The Trump administration has emphasised onshoring supply chains for materials deemed essential to national defence, making domestic production facilities like the Redwood Materials critical minerals plant strategically valuable beyond their commercial applications.

The facility positions Redwood as the only major domestic source of cobalt, a critical element used in military aircraft engines and defence applications. Combined output from both facilities produces nickel and lithium volumes comparable to the largest traditional mining operations in the United States, significantly reducing import dependency for these strategic materials.

Supply chain resilience becomes particularly crucial when considering the geographic concentration of current critical mineral production. Many essential materials originate from politically unstable regions or countries with complex diplomatic relationships, making domestic alternatives essential for long-term security planning.

Market Dynamics Driving Domestic Production

Federal policy support has provided substantial backing for domestic critical minerals development through various mechanisms. The facility benefits from a $2 billion Department of Energy loan programme designed to accelerate domestic battery material processing capabilities. Additional support comes through Inflation Reduction Act provisions that incentivise domestic content in battery supply chains.

Industrial demand drivers extend well beyond electric vehicle applications. Data centres requiring massive energy storage systems represent a rapidly growing market segment, particularly as artificial intelligence and cloud computing drive exponential power consumption increases. Grid-scale energy storage applications similarly require substantial volumes of battery materials as renewable energy integration accelerates.

Moreover, aerospace and defence applications create additional demand streams for high-purity critical minerals. Speciality alloy applications in jet engines, military equipment, and industrial machinery require materials meeting exacting specifications that domestic suppliers can provide with greater reliability than international sources.

What Production Capabilities Does the South Carolina Plant Offer?

Current Output and Processing Metrics

Facility Location Annual Recovery Capacity Primary Materials Operational Status South Carolina 20,000 metric tons Li, Ni, Co, Cu Ramping up Nevada (Sparks) 60,000 metric tons Li, Ni, Co, Cu Full operation Combined Total 80,000 metric tons All critical minerals Active

The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant currently operates below full capacity as production systems undergo optimisation and scaling procedures. Redwood has not announced a specific timeline for reaching maximum throughput, reflecting the complex nature of scaling advanced recycling operations whilst maintaining quality standards.

Production capabilities encompass the complete spectrum of critical battery materials. The facility processes lithium for battery cathodes, recovers nickel for various alloy applications, extracts cobalt for high-performance components, and recycles copper for electrical applications. This comprehensive material recovery eliminates the need for multiple specialised processing facilities.

Manufacturing Integration and Value-Added Processing

Beyond basic material recovery, the facility incorporates value-added processing capabilities that transform recycled materials into components ready for battery manufacturing. Cathode active material production represents a key capability, allowing Redwood to supply materials directly to battery manufacturers rather than requiring additional processing steps.

However, the company has scaled back certain manufacturing plans in response to market conditions. Copper foil production, originally planned for both Nevada and South Carolina facilities, has been discontinued in Nevada and will not proceed in South Carolina. This strategic adjustment reflects changing market dynamics and customer demand patterns.

The Nevada cathode production facility, originally scheduled to open in 2024 with 100 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity, remains under construction without an announced completion date. These delays highlight the challenges of scaling battery material manufacturing operations whilst maintaining quality and cost competitiveness.

How Does Redwood's Business Model Address Market Challenges?

Diversification Beyond Electric Vehicle Sector

Redwood has strategically pivoted from its original focus on electric vehicle battery supply chains to serve broader industrial markets. This shift responds to slower-than-expected EV adoption rates and policy uncertainties affecting federal incentive programmes. The bulk of critical minerals produced now serves customers outside the automotive sector.

Industrial applications provide more stable demand patterns compared to the cyclical nature of automotive production. Stainless steel manufacturers require consistent nickel supplies, whilst aerospace companies maintain steady demand for cobalt-based alloys. Speciality chemical producers similarly offer predictable volume requirements that support consistent facility utilisation.

In addition, the company's customer base spans approximately 20 to 30 companies across multiple industries, creating revenue diversification that reduces dependence on any single market segment. This approach insulates operations from sector-specific downturns whilst capitalising on the fundamental demand for critical minerals across various applications.

Energy Storage and Data Centre Applications

Redwood has launched Redwood Energy, a dedicated division focused on converting degraded electric vehicle batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. This innovation extends battery life cycles by repurposing components that no longer meet automotive performance standards but remain suitable for stationary applications.

The company has demonstrated this capability through a 63 megawatt-hour energy storage system paired with 12 megawatts of solar generation at its Nevada campus. This installation powers a 2,000 GPU data centre, showcasing the practical application of repurposed battery technology in high-demand computing environments.

Furthermore, energy storage applications represent a rapidly growing market segment as data centres expand to support artificial intelligence workloads and cloud computing services. Redwood raised $350 million in Series E funding at a valuation exceeding $6 billion, with proceeds partially dedicated to accelerating energy storage system deployment.

What Are the Economic and Environmental Benefits?

Job Creation and Regional Development Impact

The South Carolina facility generates high-skilled manufacturing positions in advanced materials processing, contributing to the state's emerging clean technology sector. These positions require specialised training in chemical processing, quality control, and advanced manufacturing techniques, creating career opportunities in cutting-edge industrial applications.

Regional economic multiplier effects extend beyond direct employment at the facility. Supporting services, transportation providers, and specialised equipment suppliers establish operations to serve the critical minerals processing complex. This ecosystem development attracts additional investment in complementary manufacturing operations.

Consequently, the facility's presence enhances South Carolina's competitiveness in attracting battery manufacturing operations and related clean technology investments. Proximity to domestic critical minerals processing reduces supply chain risks for manufacturers considering facility locations, creating additional economic development opportunities.

Environmental Sustainability Metrics

Battery recycling operations significantly reduce environmental impacts compared to primary mining for critical minerals. Traditional lithium extraction requires extensive water usage and land disturbance, whilst cobalt mining often involves environmentally destructive practices in sensitive ecosystems. Recycling operations minimise these environmental costs whilst recovering equivalent material volumes.

The circular economy model reduces waste streams that would otherwise require specialised disposal or create long-term environmental liabilities. End-of-life batteries contain materials that can pose environmental risks if improperly managed, making recovery and recycling essential for sustainable battery deployment at scale.

Moreover, energy consumption for recycling processes generally requires less total energy input than primary extraction and processing of virgin materials. This efficiency creates carbon footprint advantages that become more significant as the electric grid incorporates higher percentages of renewable energy sources.

What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead?

Market Adaptation Strategies

Political and policy uncertainties create ongoing challenges for long-term business planning. The Trump administration's cancellation of federal grants to battery recyclers highlights the vulnerability of clean technology investments to changing political priorities. Companies must develop resilient business models that can adapt to shifting policy landscapes.

Customer diversification strategies help mitigate these risks by reducing dependence on government-supported market segments. Industrial applications for critical minerals often demonstrate greater stability than emerging technology sectors subject to policy volatility or changing consumer preferences.

However, technology scaling challenges require continuous innovation and process optimisation. Maintaining competitive cost structures whilst achieving high recovery rates and material purity demands ongoing research and development investments. Companies must balance operational efficiency with technological advancement to maintain market leadership.

Competitive Positioning in Global Markets

International competition in critical minerals processing continues intensifying as countries worldwide recognise the strategic importance of domestic supply chains. The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant must maintain technological advantages and cost competitiveness against established operations in Asia and emerging facilities in other Western countries.

Quality standards become increasingly important as customer applications demand higher material purity and consistency. Aerospace and defence applications require materials meeting stringent specifications that provide opportunities for premium pricing but demand substantial quality control investments.

Furthermore, innovation in processing efficiency and material recovery rates creates competitive advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate. Proprietary technologies and process improvements can establish market leadership positions that generate superior financial returns over extended periods.

How Does This Impact the Future of Critical Minerals Supply?

Industry Transformation and Market Leadership

Redwood's South Carolina facility represents a fundamental shift in how America approaches critical minerals supply security. By establishing domestic processing capabilities that rival traditional mining operations, the company demonstrates the viability of recycling-based supply chains for strategic materials.

The combined 80,000 metric ton annual capacity positions Redwood among the largest critical minerals producers in the United States. This scale enables the company to serve as a reliable supplier for major industrial customers whilst maintaining the flexibility to respond to changing market demands across multiple sectors.

In addition, technology transfer opportunities exist for replicating successful processing methods at additional locations. As demand for critical minerals continues growing, proven recycling technologies can be scaled to serve regional markets whilst maintaining competitive cost structures and environmental advantages.

Long-Term Supply Chain Evolution

Integration with renewable energy infrastructure development creates synergistic opportunities as both sectors expand simultaneously. Battery energy storage systems require the same critical minerals that Redwood recovers, whilst renewable energy projects provide the clean electricity needed for sustainable processing operations.

Export market potential emerges as domestic production capacity exceeds local demand in certain material categories. American-produced critical minerals could serve allied countries seeking to reduce dependence on geopolitically sensitive supply sources, creating additional revenue opportunities for domestic producers.

Furthermore, research and development initiatives focus on next-generation battery chemistries that may require different critical minerals or processing approaches. Staying ahead of technological evolution ensures that recycling infrastructure remains relevant as battery technologies continue advancing toward higher energy densities and improved performance characteristics.

(Reuters) — Canada's TC Energy missed estimates for third-quarter profit on Nov. 6, but extended its current earnings growth outlook through 2028 based on what it says is increased demand from AI data centers and the LNG industry.

Robust North American energy fundamentals mean the Calgary-based company now expects earnings growth of 5% to 7% annually for the next three years, CEO François Poirier said on a conference call.

RELATED: TC Energy Puts $700 Million Wisconsin Pipeline Project in Service

""Across North America, the policy environment is becoming increasingly supportive, enabling more timely and cost-effective delivery of our projects,"" Poirier said.

Poirier added he is encouraged by the Canadian government's recent move to designate a potential second phase of Shell's LNG Canada project as being in the national interest, as well as U.S. permitting reforms that are helping to drive demand for new natural gas projects.

TC Energy operates a 58,100 mile-long network of pipelines, supplying more than 30% of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America.

The company is forecasting North American natural gas demand to increase by 45 Bcf/d by 2035, primarily driven by a tripling of LNG exports and unprecedented power demand from data centers and coal-to-gas conversions.

The company, which has placed approximately C$8 billion of projects into service so far this year, said on Thursday a steady cadence of new project announcements will continue into 2026.

The average size of new projects could grow from the current C$500 million to about C$1 billion next year, Poirier said. TC Energy may look to increase capital spending next year beyond its current C$6 billion range, Poirier added.

U.S. natural gas futures fell more than 4% sequentially in the third quarter, weighing on TC Energy's transport volumes.

Net income from the company's U.S. natural gas pipelines, its largest segment, fell to C$801 million ($571.16 million) in the third quarter, from C$1.3 billion a year ago.

The company expects adjusted core profit for 2026 to be in the range of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion, nearly 6% to 8% growth year-over-year.

It also anticipates 2028 core profit to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $13.1 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7% between 2025 and 2028.

EDISON, N.J., Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (""Eos"" or the “Company”), an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Highlights

Record quarterly revenue of $30.5 million, a 100% increase compared to the prior quarter and up 35x from the same period last year, as production efficiencies continue to improve.

Gross loss of $33.9 million compared to $31.0 million in the prior quarter, a 92-point margin improvement, driven by increased production volumes and improved project margins.

Operating expenses totaled $27.3 million, $5.6 million lower than prior quarter.

Net loss attributable to shareholders totaled $641.4 million, driven primarily by a $572.3 million cumulative non-cash impact from the changes in fair value tied to mark-to-market adjustments driven by 122% increase in the Company’s stock price as of September 30, 2025, and the corresponding loss recorded for the early retirement of convertible notes with a 26.5% interest rate.

Adjusted EBITDA loss of $52.7 million compared to $51.6 million in the prior quarter, a 166-point improvement on improved manufacturing variable cost utilization.

Total cash of $126.8 million, including restricted cash, as of September 30, 2025.

Commercial opportunity pipeline of $22.6 billion, an increase of 21% compared to prior quarter and 59% compared to September 30, 2024, with $644.4 million of orders in backlog as of September 30, 2025.

“We are in the midst of an energy super-cycle as the need for reliable, abundant energy both in the United States and globally continues to accelerate,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “Achieving forecasted AI infrastructure growth requires baseload energy storage to support grid resilience, energy efficiency, and asset utilization. Whether coupled with fossil fuel generation, renewables, or nuclear, Eos is a flexible, commercially ready, American made solution that supports the nation’s growing energy requirements.”

2025 Outlook

The Company expects full year revenue in the range of $150 million to $160 million, consistent with the low end of its previously forecasted range. In recent months, Eos has advanced the implementation of subassembly automation at its Turtle Creek manufacturing facility, with all equipment now on site and 88% of its bipolar lines in commercial production. This automation, combined with increasing throughput on the Company’s first state-of-the-art manufacturing line, positions Eos to ramp production to an annualized rate of 2 GWh per year by year-end 2025 and more than triple its output in the fourth quarter.

Recent Business Highlights

Commercial Growth

Artificial intelligence infrastructure is expanding at an unprecedented pace, pushing electricity demand beyond traditional grid development timelines and creating the need for resilient, scalable energy solutions. At the same time, U.S.-based energy resources and supply chains are gaining strategic advantage amid shifting trade dynamics, tariffs, and export controls, positioning Eos as a key contributor to America’s energy independence. During the quarter, Eos added $3.8 billion to its commercial pipeline, bringing the total to $22.6 billion, representing 91 GWh of energy storage capacity. Growth was driven by strong increase in large-scale projects tied to data center expansion, which now account for approximately 22% of the total pipeline.

Post-quarter end, Eos announced a series of strategic wins which added nearly 1 GWh of new orders, highlighting its growing influence across both domestic and international markets. Eos secured a 228 MWh order from Frontier Power, a leading UK developer, to deploy Z3™ systems across multiple long-duration demonstrations ahead of the UK’s Ofgem Cap-and-Floor program. In the U.S., Eos signed a 750 MWh supply agreement with MN8 Energy to deliver clean, dispatchable power for large load applications such as data centers. Talen Energy and Eos also signed a strategic collaboration framework to deliver multi-GWh storage capacity across Pennsylvania, pairing long-duration storage with existing generation assets to enhance grid resilience, support AI growth, and strengthen national energy security.

Capacity Expansion

Post-quarter end, Eos announced the next phase of its growth strategy under Project AMAZE, featuring a U.S. manufacturing expansion and new software hub to strengthen American energy storage capacity and job creation. In partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Governor Josh Shapiro along with Allegheny County and its County Executive Sara Innamorato, Eos was awarded a $24 million economic development package to support this expansion. The Company will move into a repurposed 432,000 sq. ft. facility in Marshall Township, adding production lines to its existing Turtle Creek operations with line 2 production expected to begin by mid-2026.

Eos will also open a software hub at Nova Place in Pittsburgh to support its growing installed base with its DawnOS™ platform, advancing software, robotics, and engineering capabilities that power the next generation of U.S.-made energy storage systems. Fully developed in the U.S., DawnOS™ uses advanced algorithms for State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH), and State of Energy (SoE) to improve efficiency, reduce operating costs, and enhance grid coordination. Purpose-built for Eos’ Z3™ systems, DawnOS™ provides precise, automated control down to the individual module level, increasing both reliability and uptime.

Key Metrics

Backlog. Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure for backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.

Pipeline. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.

Booked Orders. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.

We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.

(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Thursday expanded a list of critical minerals it deems essential to the U.S. economy and national security, adding copper, ​vital to electric vehicles, power grids, and data centers, and metallurgical coal, used to make ‌coke fuel for steel production.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding ‌the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

LIST GUIDES FEDERAL INCENTIVES

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where ⁠the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and ‌industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

The ‍Interior Department said critical minerals ""underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer ​with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said this year it could generate more ‌than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for ⁠handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (​copper) production, it's important to recognize that the U.S.​ doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

Putting met coal on the list aligns with President Donald Trump's support of fossil fuels.‍ Some U.S. met ⁠coal mines have shut in recent months amid ample supply and a reduction in exports to China, which put an additional 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coal this year.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO ⁠of the National Mining Association, said it will continue to seek the expansion of the list to ""ensure that the U.S. has the ‌abundant domestic resources it needs, when it needs them.""

Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run.
Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills.
Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.","Michigan families already know the pain of high utility bills, and unfortunately, those bills are only headed far higher.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.

The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.

These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.

But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.

The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.

The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.

These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.

There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.

Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.

The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.

The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.

Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.

But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money-1024x6821762445037.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=uERnppgL,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:55.296610

VSB Poland breaks ground on 303-MWp photovoltaic park

© VSB Group/Agata MajasowWroc?aw/Dresden (renewablepress) - Construction has officially begun on one of Poland’s largest photovoltaic parks, located in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. With a planned capacity of 303-megawatt-peak (MWp), the Brzezinka project by VSB Polska sets new benchmarks – also on a European scale.

The PV park, which includes an integrated 106-MW-battery energy storage system (BESS), is being developed on a site covering more than 260 hectares northeast of Wroc?aw. Full commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2027. By then, approximately 70 kilometres of underground cabling will have been laid to connect the facility to the designated grid connection point, and over 467,000 photovoltaic modules will have been installed. With work now under way on the access roads, the project has officially entered the execution phase in the municipality of Ole?nica, including the districts of Brzezinka and Syców.

The PV park with its integrated BEES unit marks the first phase of construction. Planning and approval processes for a wind farm with up to 245 MW are already in progress, paving the way for Brzezinka to become a hybrid park – one of the largest in Europe.

The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by landowners and local officials, including ?ukasz Kasprzak, Deputy Director of the Department of Economy and Promotion, Marshal's Office of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, who emphasises: ""Today's groundbreaking is an important milestone not only for the local community, but also for the entire Lower Silesia region. The Brzezinka project aligns perfectly with the objectives of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship's energy strategy, which envisages the development of modern, low-emission energy sources and strengthening the region's energy security. This investment demonstrates the significant impact that can be achieved through cooperation among the regional government, local partners, businesses, and international investors. Thanks to it, we are creating new jobs, supporting local economic development, and investing in a future powered by sustainable energy. The Brzezinka project is an example of the practical implementation of Lower Silesia's goals in climate protection, innovation, and energy transformation – a direction in which the entire region is consistently heading.""

Hubert Kowalski, Managing Director of VSB Polska, comments: “Our close collaboration with local partners and landowners shows how sustainable energy generation, economic development, and community engagement can go hand in hand to create lasting value. With foresight, we are securing long-term commitment and opportunities for the region.”

Dr Felix Grolman, CEO of VSB Group, adds: “The start of construction for the Brzezinka project marks the launch of an energy park that will seamlessly combine photovoltaics, wind power, and battery storage. As VSB Group, we are paving the way for further investments. Poland, with its growing electricity demand and increasingly stable policy environment, offers ideal conditions for the expansion of renewable energy.”

It's a new take on a standard desalination system that could quench the thirst for some of the world's 4.4 billion people who lack safe drinking water. The setup is particularly effective in remote regions and can make ocean water potable, according to ETV Bharat and research published by Science.

""This system is said to perform the desalination process faster and more cost-effectively than existing methods,"" per ETV Bharat.

Common desalination kits use solar heat or another source, along with a wick, to evaporate and condense water, removing the salt that builds up and clogs the works. The systems have been hard to scale, as well.

The institute team added a siphon, leveraging gravity to aid the process. A fabric wick pulls water from a salty tank. The water is spread over a grooved, heated metallic surface (ideally heated by solar energy) and cooled on another plate just a fraction of an inch away, causing condensation. Fresh water is collected as a gravity-powered siphon tube supplies water to continuously flush the salt away, preventing buildup, according to ETV Bharat.

The setup can produce about 1.5 gallons of water per hour under sunlight, beating the performance of standard contraptions. Units can be stacked to recycle heat and maximize efficiency. It's cheap to make from aluminum and cloth and can purify water that contains as much as 20% salt, ETV Bharat added.

The U.S. Geological Survey reported that an astounding 97% of Earth's water, on and within it, is salty. About 3.5% of the weight of seawater is from the salt it contains, making desalination a vital tool to combat drought-stricken and water-poor places.

NASA has linked our planet's warming, largely due to continued fossil fuel burning, to greater risks for extreme droughts. The agency said that in this case, higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the surface, which is held in the atmosphere, and increases warming in a cycle. It's a problem also impacting the global food supply as plants shrivel.

That's why researchers elsewhere are working to perfect similar desalination concepts. Experts in Canada are developing filters to purify contaminated underground water, as another example.

Fresh water is important to ecosystems all over the planet. They not only sustain life, but also prevent erosion and even flooding, according to WWF. Staying informed about how Earth's overheating, coastal flooding, and other factors are impacting our clean water supply is important for raising awareness of efforts to conserve these resources.

Smarter water use at home can make a difference and save you money. Rain barrels collect rainwater for use in your gardens and flower beds, helping lower your water bill. Using a dishwasher can cut water use and save more than $200 a year — all while letting the machine do the work for you.

In the meantime, the research team in India intends to have a reliable way for people in remote areas to filter water so they don't go thirsty as part of potentially life-saving work.

,Congress,2025-11-06 16:31:38+00:00,the Guardian,Experts call for new taxes on worst polluters to help poorer nations with climate crisis,"Fiona Harvey, www.theguardian.com, fiona-harvey",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/wealth-and-fossil-fuel-taxes-to-fund-aid-for-poorer-states,"Rebecca Newsom, the global political expert for Greenpeace International, said: “It’s notable that the roadmap recognises new taxes and levies as key to unlocking public climate finance.
The roadmap will form the basis of discussions of climate finance at Cop30.
Making it easier and cheaper for developing countries to gain access to private sector capital for their clean energy investments will be key, the roadmap acknowledges.
Campaigners said there was no escaping the reality that rich governments must step up to help the poor, if the world was to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.
We still need to see the money for real support to developing countries if we are serious about climate justice.”","New taxes on the super-rich, fossil fuels, financial transactions and highly polluting and carbon-intensive activities should be explored as key ways of raising the finance needed to help poor countries, governments have been told in an influential report.

The proposal is one of the top recommendations of a new blueprint for global climate finance, the Baku to Belém roadmap, drawn up by the governments of Brazil and Azerbaijan, the current and the previous president of the UN climate Cop process.

In a surprisingly strong intervention, they call for “strengthened international cooperation on taxation, and experiments with voluntary partnerships between countries on, for example, sector-based contributions, highly polluting and greenhouse gas intensive activities, financial transactions and ultra high net worth individuals”.

They add the caveat that countries should “carefully consider potential negative impacts on development priorities and trade and redistribution mechanisms”.

Campaigners welcomed the call. Rebecca Newsom, the global political expert for Greenpeace International, said: “It’s notable that the roadmap recognises new taxes and levies as key to unlocking public climate finance. Given reported profits from just five international oil and gas giants over the last decade reached almost $800bn, taxing fossil fuel corporations is clearly a huge opportunity to overcome national fiscal constraints.”

World leaders are descending on Belém, the Brazilian city at the mouth of the Amazon, for two days of talks starting on Thursday, before the UN Cop30 climate summit formally begins, and finance will be high on their agenda.

The roadmap will form the basis of discussions of climate finance at Cop30. Last year’s “conference of the parties” in Baku set a goal of £1.3tn to be provided annually to poor countries by 2035, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. But there was a bitter taste for many when rich countries pledged to stump up only $300bn of that sum, leaving the rest to come from potential new taxes and levies, the private sector, and related sources.

The Baku to Belém roadmap is an attempt to heal those divisions, by showing how the finance goal can be reached. Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijani minister who was president of Cop29, said: “The roadmap shows there is a clear path to scaling up climate finance to the developing world to $1.3tn by 2035. It is possible, but political will and global action are absolutely necessary.”

He warned: “As temperatures continue to rise and countries submit their next climate plans scaling up finance is the critical factor for success. Countries simply cannot cut emissions if they cannot count on the capital they need to meet their ambitions.”

Developing countries suffering from high debt burdens also need relief, potentially through swapping some of their outstanding debt for investment in projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions or help countries adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, according to the report.

Making it easier and cheaper for developing countries to gain access to private sector capital for their clean energy investments will be key, the roadmap acknowledges. Developing countries currently pay much higher interest rates on loans and capital injections than their rich counterparts, but assistance from the World Bank and other publicly funded institutions could drastically reduce that, making it easier for poor countries to fund their climate projects.

Equity and the social impacts of the shift to clean energy must also be high priorities, according to the report. “Without careful attention to the social dimensions of this transformation, there is a risk of exacerbating inequality, undermining public trust, and slowing progress on climate action. Building fair change together with workers, women, Indigenous Peoples and local communities supported by dedicated funding windows can have catalytic effects.”

The World Bank and other multilateral development banks will also need “replenishment” – fresh capital from the governments that are their shareholders. That may be more difficult to find now that President Donald Trump has dismantled much of US overseas aid, and other countries are also cutting their aid budgets.

Campaigners said there was no escaping the reality that rich governments must step up to help the poor, if the world was to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. Carolina Pasquali, the executive director of Greenpeace Brasil, said: “The inequalities left behind by the inadequate climate finance goal agreed at Cop29 have not been resolved with this roadmap – we still need significantly more public finance for mitigation [cutting and avoiding emissions], adaptation and loss and damage.”

She added: “While the roadmap rightly recognises the gap in concessional finance, including for nature and providing direct access to Indigenous peoples and local communities, it does not go far enough in holding developed countries accountable. We still need to see the money for real support to developing countries if we are serious about climate justice.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35137542b2f13127dc328a9cbc4a5f4760a20bf6/573_0_4502_3601/master/4502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce0aa9ad566b7b0576093c9a05a89177",N,,2025-11-06 12:08:48.022699

(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a new list of critical minerals it deems essential to the U.S. economy and national security, adding copper, which is vital to electric vehicles, power grids, and data centers, as well as metallurgical coal, which is used to make coke.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

""Critical minerals are essential for national security, economic stability, and supply-chain resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy,"" the Interior Department said in announcing the list.

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said earlier this year it could generate more than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical by Washington.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (copper) production, it's important to recognize that the U.S. doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

We do not discount the fact that the GHGRP can create regulatory and financial burdens for commodity and energy producers. However, in the aggregate, the GHGRP data infrastructure and EPA’s centralized repository are invaluable to American companies because of the increasing pivot towards greenhouse gas–based trade instruments in Europe and elsewhere. What’s more, entire tax credit regimes that are critical to American competitiveness in emerging technology sectors depend on the program’s administration. There’s a middle ground that requires neither business as usual nor a complete destruction of the program and its attendant benefits: a voluntary, opt-in approach to emissions reporting that maintains the trusted, consolidated platform for information. This solution would benefit those who wish to opt in without burdening those who choose not to.

Executive Summary

A complete repeal of the GHGRP and subsequent proliferation of private, state, and international regulations would lead to

1. A blunting of the United States’ competitive edge in artificial intelligence and data-center development

2. The loss of key data for efficient oil and gas production and the loss of industry’s access to global markets

3. Bureaucratic chaos for emerging energy technologies that use federal funding

4. Increased cost in exchange for lower-quality reporting for companies, including increased regulatory burdens imposed by states

Allowing companies to continue to comply with the GHGRP in some capacity would mitigate these damages and enable the continued growth of domestic energy and technology sectors.

History of the GHGRP

The GHGRP did not start as a mandate for climate regulations. Rather, it was designed under a Republican administration as a core program for information collection and transparency.

Legislative Mandate and Inception

The GHGRP was signed into law in 2007 under President George W. Bush as a voluntary program and enacted in the 2008 Appropriations Consolidation Act. The law directed EPA to establish a program for the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above certain thresholds across sectors of the U.S. economy. The EPA finalized the rule in 2009, and data collection began in 2010.

Program Scope: The program requires large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and injection sites to report their annual emissions. It currently covers approximately 85–90 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions from over 8,000 unique sources. It requires emissions reporting from direct emissions sources that exceed 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year. Some sources, including those involved in aluminum, cement, and ammonia production; electricity generation; and landfills, are required to report emissions regardless of the volume of emissions.

Legal Authority: As directed by Congress, in its initial rulemaking, EPA cited multiple sections of the Clean Air Act (Sections 114, 208, 821) as the legal basis for implementing the program compulsorily.

How the GHGRP Creates Value for Business

For companies with emitting facilities or covered operations in the United States, the GHGRP provides a centralized, standardized, government-backed, and cost-effective mechanism for emissions accounting, which is increasingly critical for internal management and external credibility. Over the past decade, EPA has developed rigorous technical methodologies for calculating GHG emissions from over two dozen source categories, providing a comprehensive and internally consistent accounting framework.

Verifiable Government Data and Cost-Effectiveness

The GHGRP’s utility stems from its status as a single, unified federal standard for emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV).

Trade Policy and Oil and Gas Export Advantages: U.S. oil and gas producers are differentiating their products. The GHGRP provides publicly accessible, government-verified facility-level data, which can demonstrate the superiority of American energy and commodity exports without forcing businesses to develop and adopt new voluntary standards that lack the support of the U.S. government.

Advantage in AI and Data-Center Development: As the AI race ramps up, the United States has established a strong lead by making use of its robust infrastructure, policy, and resource advantages. However, as new interconnection and generation costs increase emissions and (in some cases) electricity rates, large-scale data-center development has increasingly yielded local resistance. The GHGRP provides hyperscalers a turnkey reporting framework to address transparency concerns.

Low Cost of Compliance: Compliance with the GHGRP, while requiring initial investment, is generally of relatively low cost to reporting entities compared to the burden and expense of independent third-party verification, which would otherwise be required to meet investor or regulatory demands. By providing an inherently government-verified and quality-assured dataset, the GHGRP eliminates the need for redundant, costly audits across various voluntary frameworks, thus streamlining corporate reporting and reducing administrative overhead. There is evidence and concern in the semiconductor industry that the full repeal of the GHGRP would result in the proliferation of regulations as states replace the GHGRP with their own reporting systems, which may or may not be cohesive and transferable from state to state.

Internal Emissions Management: The detailed methodologies mandated by the GHGRP help businesses track and compare emissions year over year, identify energy inefficiencies, minimize waste, and find opportunities to save money through operational improvements.

Alignment with Other Key Federal Programs: Facilities reporting under the GHGRP may also be subject to reporting under other administrative programs such as tax credits or Underground Injection Control programs. The GHGRP is intentionally designed to be coordinated with and conducive to the needs of these programs to avoid duplicative efforts and reduce administrative burdens.

Key Sectoral Importance

Oil and Gas Sector

The oil and gas sector is a primary focus of the GHGRP, mainly through Subpart RR, VV, and W (Geologic Sequestration, Enhanced Oil Recovery, Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems) emissions.

Differentiated Oil and Gas Exports: The oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions. While the rule acknowledges that Subpart W reporting will be reinitiated in 2034 (except for the distribution segment), the GHGRP provides immense value for the oil and gas sector today beyond the future implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge. GHGRP data is vital for

Investment and Markets: The GHGRP identifies lower-emissions-intensity oil and gas products so their producers can access premium international markets that increasingly require verifiable low-carbon sourcing. The GHGRP’s granular data allows companies to benchmark their performance and demonstrate superiority over competing exporters. Without the GHGRP, American oil and gas producers will not have a rigorous and consistent benchmark against which to demonstrate their competitive advantage. Leading liquified natural gas (LNG) markets such as Japan and the European Union are implementing policies to regulate the carbon intensity of imported LNG.

Cost Savings and Increased Capacity: When they know where methane leaks are occurring, companies are better able to mitigate those leaks and ensure that methane reaches its end use in power or commodities. This increases the production and efficiency of American natural gas.

Artificial Intelligence Sector

The AI sector and its rapidly expanding need for data centers are increasingly relevant to the GHGRP.

Energy and Emissions Footprint: The vast computational resources required for training and running AI models demand massive amounts of electricity, leading to large GHG emissions from their captive power generation. Policymakers and corporate leaders mutually benefit from understanding the emissions impact of these facilities, especially as a tool to identify regions with low-carbon power, which private industry is now demanding.

GHGRP Link: Large data centers (with colocated power) and related manufacturing facilities often exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 tCO2e under GHGRP, especially for their combustion sources (Subpart C) and industrial gas usage.

Public Acceptance: As AI’s energy demand comes under scrutiny, GHGRP data provides a credible, government-verified emissions disclosure mechanism that helps the sector manage its public perception and meet growing stakeholder pressure for sustainable operations. The GHGRP gives data-center developers, users, and power suppliers quality-assured assessments of a given operation’s full emissions impact on a power system.

The Role of the GHGRP for Emerging Technologies and Federal Investment

The GHGRP is indispensable for the operation and integrity of two major federal incentives for emerging energy technologies: Section 45Q and Section 45V tax credits. A full repeal would force the IRS to revoke and update current verification and compliance guidance for crucial innovation tax credits included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This would strain internal resources at the IRS and delay or prevent private capital from being deployed.

Section 45Q: Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit, which provides a credit per ton of securely stored or utilized carbon, depends on the GHGRP for its MRV requirements.

Projects claiming the credit for permanent geologic storage (e.g., Class VI wells) or enhanced oil recovery (e.g., Class II wells) must adhere to GHGRP Subpart RR or VV, respectively. Subparts RR and VV mandate a detailed, EPA-approved plan for monitoring and reporting.

The amount eligible for the 45Q credit is quantified and publicly reported through the GHGRP. This linkage ensures that the IRS has a validated, standardized, and transparent mechanism to verify the performance-based nature of the credit before taxpayer money is claimed, thereby safeguarding against fraud.

Section 45V: Clean Hydrogen Production

The 45V tax credit, providing up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen based on its lifecycle emissions, also relies on GHGRP’s foundational data.

Lifecycle Emissions Analysis: While 45V uses the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for calculating lifecycle emissions intensity, the input data for the emissions associated with hydrogen production (e.g., from natural gas reformers using carbon capture or from manufacturing inputs) often draws from the verifiable facility-level data collected by the GHGRP (e.g., Subparts C and W data).

Blue Hydrogen Projects: For blue hydrogen projects (produced from natural gas), the required capture and secure storage must be reported under the same GHGRP Subpart RR standards that govern the 45Q credit, making GHGRP compliance a prerequisite for maximizing the 45V credit value.

Conclusion

The GHGRP is a crucial piece of economic infrastructure. It provides the verifiable data that underpins corporate accountability and is the cost-effective, standardized mechanism required to validate multi-billion-dollar investments in the U.S. energy economy through the 45Q and 45V tax credits. Weakening the program would undermine the integrity of these incentives and diminish U.S. competitiveness in the global energy technology landscape.

EPA should reconsider its proposed rule dismantling the GHGRP and instead pursue a voluntary, opt-in approach to the program.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/d8lrla4f/staging/ca60dde0b5d72df0c6bc75f6f4c628bd384de96b-3840x1920.png,N,,2025-11-06 12:09:00.513226

Also yesterday, SolarEdge announced a collaboration with German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon to build solid-state transformers (SST) for use in data centres. Growing electricity demand from data centres has been a key topic of conversation in the energy sector this year, but SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir said on a conference call to discuss the results that SolarEdge is looking at the collaboration “as something that is not going to be a major investment from our side”.

Responding to the US policy environment

Nir also fielded several questions on the topic of US policy, particularly on the topic of tariffs imposed on goods imported from overseas, and the tightening of foreign entity of concern (FEOC) legislation that will likely disrupt international trade further. The company’s financial results suggested that tariffs had a negative impact of 2% on gross margin, and Kir said that he expects the impact on margin in the fourth quarter to be similar.

“We are extremely focused on diversifying and optimising our supply chain to address this dynamic tariff environment,” said Nir. “At the same time, the quality of the availability of our products is very important to us. The impact also may be mitigated by some pricing actions that we may take.”

While SolarEdge has not historically hosted significant manufacturing capacity in the US—entering the space for the first time in July 2024—Nir expressed optimism that projects in the US using SolarEdge products will still be able to benefit from investment tax credit (ITC) support, despite the government’s tightening of eligibility criteria for such tax credits.

“Certain partners have safe harboured with us through the 5% method,” said Nir, referring to the fact that energy projects with less than 1.5MW of capacity can secure ITC support by spending 5% of a project’s total costs within a certain timeframe. “We designed and executed customised safe harbouring strategies [and] such transactions have several benefits. For customers, it lets them [have] quality projects over multiple years for lower capital outlay.”

For larger projects that are ineligible for this 5% spend threshold, they must pass a “physical work test” to demonstrate that “physical work of a significant nature” has started at the project. While this is a more subjective assessment, Nir said that SolarEdge has worked closely with its partners at larger projects to ensure that construction work will be completed quickly, and to a standard that will pass this assessment.

“By helping our customers safe harbour through the physical work of significant nature method, we are able to manufacture and deliver the full product closer to the time the customer needs it,” explained Nir. “Therefore, we can manage the manufacturing over time and there is no fall forward of revenue typically associated with a 5% safe harbour transaction.”

Commercial-scale inverters and storage to drive future growth

Nir also said that the company’s strengths are “even more pronounced” in the commercial and industrial (C&I) space in the US, and that SolarEdge is “the only scale player capable of delivering a non-FEOC and domestic content-compliant C&I solution.”

While the company has not published inverter sales per market segment since the first quarter of 2025, commercial inverters has historically been a significant part of SolarEdge’s sales output, as shown in the graph below.

Nir added that he expects the company to sell well in the European C&I space too, particularly for C&I BESS systems, due to the fact that the company’s distribution partners have “normalised levels of inventory” so are receptive to receiving and selling on new products.

“Due to the fact that [products] are going to be manufactured in the US and exported to Europe, this allows us to be more competitive in the marketplace without sacrificing margin necessarily and all of these reasons are giving us optimism [as] there is definitely room to grow,” added Nir.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief.
Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run.
Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills.
Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.","Michigan families already know the pain of high utility bills, and unfortunately, those bills are only headed far higher.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.

The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.

These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.

But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.

The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.

The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.

These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.

There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.

Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.

The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.

The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.

Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.

But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 12:08:23.105388

Furthermore, the budget allocates C$585 million over four years under a new Climate Competitiveness Strategy to support various critical minerals projects.

Expansion of Exploration Tax Credits and Industrial Incentives In an effort to stimulate exploration, the government plans to broaden the eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC).","Canada’s Liberal government on Tuesday proposed a C$2 billion ($1.4 billion) sovereign fund for critical minerals, alongside hundreds of millions in new mining industry spending and an expansion of exploration tax credits, according to the federal budget released on April 1. The initiative aims to bolster domestic supply chains, attract global investment, and strengthen national security by securing a reliable supply of critcal minerals essential for defense, semiconductors, and clean energy technologies.

Core Budget Measures Target Critical Minerals

The centerpiece of the plan is the Canada Critical Minerals Investment Fund, which will be managed by Natural Resources Canada and is designed to provide equity investments, loan guarantees, and offtake agreements for eligible critical mineral projects and companies. Budget documents indicate Natural Resources Canada will receive C$50 million over five years to facilitate the fund's establishment.

An additional key investment vehicle, the First and Last Mile Fund, is earmarked for near-term critical minerals projects to expedite their transition to production. This fund will receive approximately C$372 million over four years, starting in fiscal year 2026-27, and will absorb the existing Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, utilizing its existing funding envelope to provide up to C$1.5 billion in support through 2029-30.

Furthermore, the budget allocates C$585 million over four years under a new Climate Competitiveness Strategy to support various critical minerals projects. Another significant expenditure is C$443 million over five years to be shared between Natural Resources Canada and the department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. This funding is intended to support processing technologies, joint investments with allied nations in Canadian projects, and the stockpiling of critical minerals to reinforce both Canadian and allied national security.

Expansion of Exploration Tax Credits and Industrial Incentives

In an effort to stimulate exploration, the government plans to broaden the eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC). This expansion will now include 12 new minerals crucial for various strategic sectors: bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten. The CMETC expansion applies to specific exploration expenditures for these minerals and complements Canada’s existing flow-through share structure, a mechanism often used to channel capital from investors into junior mining companies.

The government is also moving to replace the existing industrial emissions cap with a new industrial emissions price, which will be set by Ottawa in consultation with the provinces and territories. This measure is intended to align with Canada's broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Moreover, the budget proposes new incentives designed to reduce the tax on capital spending, such as on buildings for a critical minerals’ processor, potentially lowering it to 0.4%. This compares favorably to a 12% tax rate in the United States on similar infrastructure spending, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), a move aimed at recouping manufacturing jobs lost to south of the border.

Industry Reaction and Market Context

The mining sector quickly welcomed the government's commitment. Pierre Gratton, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), stated that the budget confirms the federal government's “unwavering commitment to the Critical Minerals Strategy released three years ago.”

“These measures, taken together, send a powerful signal to the mining industry, global investors and Canada’s allies that Canada is very serious about improving the competitiveness of Canada’s mining industry,” Gratton said in a statement. He later added that the proposals promise to ""usher in a new era in mining investment,” creating high-paying jobs and boosting exports.

The new spending and incentives are framed within a broader global context of intensified competition for critical minerals, which are vital inputs for the electric vehicle battery supply chain and renewable energy infrastructure. By strengthening its domestic mining and processing capabilities, Canada aims to establish itself as a reliable, Western alternative to supply sources currently dominated by other nations.

The overall federal budget forecasts a C$78.3 billion deficit for the fiscal year ending March 31, with a plan to cut 40,000 public sector jobs by fiscal year 2028-29. The budget requires approval in Parliament, where Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government holds a minority of seats, necessitating support from opposition lawmakers for passage.

At Tesla’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, on Thursday afternoon, the company will release the results of the long-awaited shareholder vote, which determines whether Musk continues to lead the company or leaves to pursue his AI ambitions elsewhere.

Given Musk’s immense sway over his fan base, analysts widely expect the vote to pass in his favor. If it does, he’ll need to hit a series of ambitious performance targets to unlock the payout. That includes deploying one million robotaxis and delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade.

Musk will also have to prove his worth by driving Tesla’s market capitalization to $8.5 trillion in 12 separate tranches over time. And as Reuters reported earlier, Musk gets paid billions even if he misses targets, and just attains some smaller goals in the short term.

While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation.

And some analysts are skeptical of the pay package as well. Here’s more from CNBC:

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

“Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,” McRitchie said. “There’s a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.”

Sooner or later, Tesla will have to face reality. Its stock has soared largely on hopes and dreams, while the robotaxis still rely on human drivers to supervise and intervene as the vehicles break traffic rules. And sales keep sliding in every market where Tesla operates.

Tesla’s core profits still come from its passenger car business, which it seems to be sidelining as it pivots towards humanoid robots and AI. Eventually, the company will need to confront the limits of those dreams and find a more sustainable path forward.

60%: Lucid Cuts Production Target For This Year

Wall Street wasn’t happy with the earnings EV start-up Lucid Motors reported on Wednesday, despite its third-quarter revenue jumping 68% year-over-year to $336 million. The company also lowered its 2025 production target to 18,000 units, according to Reuters. It was between 18,000 and 20,000 units before.

But let’s ignore the Street for a moment, because young start-ups don't really deliver the quarterly miracles investors are hoping for. (Not in the automotive space, anyway.)

The good news is that Lucid delivered a record number of EVs in the third quarter during the surge in sales due to the end of the $7,500 federal tax credits. Production of the Gravity SUV is ramping, and the company’s mid-size electric SUV, aimed to lock horns with the Tesla Model Y and the Rivian R2, is still on track for launch late next year.

Plus, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has agreed to extend its $750 million loan to $2 billion, injecting another lifeline into the company to help it scale. The next few quarters could be rough, but don’t write the company off just yet.

90%: Redwood Materials’ Giant Factory Gets Going

Redwood Materials, the battery recycling company founded by former Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, said Thursday it has begun operations at its new $3.5 billion plant in South Carolina.

The facility adds 20,000 metric tons of annual capacity for producing critical battery materials, supplementing the 60,000 metric tons Redwood recovered and refined at its Nevada site last year.

The company said that the U.S. already sits on a vast and untapped stockpile of lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese that’s locked inside the electronics and EVs Americans use every day.

Recovering and recycling those materials could make the country more self-sufficient while sharply cutting the environmental cost of mining, Redwood said.

100%: How Can Tesla Continue To Be Profitable?

Photo by: Tesla

Tesla’s core money-making business, its Model Ys and Model 3s that it sells to everyday EV buyers, is rapidly shrinking. There’s no new volume product in sight, and the business case for the driverless Cybercab feels very TBD.

The future, Elon Musk says, will come from humanoid robots that will clock shifts in factories and fold your laundry. But that’s still a dream. The real question is how Tesla plans to sustain itself until that future arrives. Should it refocus on building new vehicles and meaningfully updating existing ones? Or by putting the $25,000 model back on track to reignite demand where it matters most?

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the U.S.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-11/Redwood-1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 12:09:58.524771

Agradeço ao Presidente Lula, ao Presidente da COP, e ao Governo e ao povo do Brasil pela calorosa hospitalidade em Belém.

Muito obrigado pela vossa liderança e firme compromisso com o multilateralismo – num momento em que o nosso mundo está em jogo.

President Lula, you have called this the COP of truth.

I could not agree more.

The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.

Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable.

We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down.

Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences.

It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security.

Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible.

This is moral failure – and deadly negligence.

Yes, the newly submitted Nationally Determined Contributions represent progress – but they still fall short of what is needed.

Even if fully implemented, they would put us on a pathway well above 2 degrees of global warming.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis is accelerating.

Record-breaking wildfires, deadly floods, super storms… shattering lives, economies, and decades of progress.

Last year, emissions reached another record high.

And today, as we have seen, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that emissions continued to rise this year.

Let us be clear: the 1.5°C limit is a red line for humanity.

It must be kept within reach.

And scientists also tell us that this is still possible.

If we act now, at speed and scale, we can make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5°C before century’s end.

Small – by peaking global emissions immediately; cutting them deeply this decade, accelerating the phase out of fossil fuels, slashing methane, and safeguarding forests and oceans – nature’s carbon sinks.

Short – by reaching global net zero by 2050 and moving swiftly to sustained net-negative emissions afterwards.

Safe – by drastically increasing investments in adaptation and resilience, and delivering Early Warnings for All by 2027.

Excellencies,

The United Nations will not give up on the 1.5 degrees goal.

Because another truth is evident:

we have never been better equipped to fight back.

A clean energy revolution has taken hold.

Solar and wind are now the cheapest sources of power – and the fastest growing sources of electricity in history.

Last year, almost all new power capacity came from renewables.

The clean-energy economy is creating jobs and driving development.

It is reshaping geopolitics – delivering energy security and price stability.

And it is connecting millions to clean and affordable energy for the first time.

The economics have shifted.

In 2024, investors poured 2 trillion US dollars into clean energy – 800 billion more than fossil fuels.

Clean energy is winning on price, performance, and potential – offering the solutions to transform our economies and protect our populations.

What’s still missing is political courage.

Fossil fuels still command vast subsidies – taxpayers’ money.

Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation – with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress.

Too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests.

Too many countries are starved of the resources to adapt – and locked out of the clean energy transition.

And too many people are losing hope that their leaders will act.

We need to move faster – and move together.

This COP must ignite a decade of acceleration and delivery.

First – countries must agree on a bold and credible response plan to close the NDC ambition gap to 1.5 degrees.

Common But Differentiated Responsibilities must apply, but that should not be an excuse for any country not to assume its fair share.

This means supercharging renewables, electrification, and energy efficiency;

Building modern grids and large-scale storage;

Halting and reversing deforestation by 2030;

Cutting methane emissions;

And setting near-term, 1.5-aligned coal phase-out schedules.

I have consistently advocated against more coal plants or fossil fuel exploration and expansion.

At COP 28 in Dubai, countries committed to transition away from fossil fuels.

No more greenwashing.

No loopholes.

We must turn that commitment into action – while supporting low- and middle-income developing countries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels.

We must also dismantle structural barriers and provide the conditions for developing countries to deliver and exceed their NDC commitments.

Trade and investment policies must support climate ambition, not undermine it.

Second – we must demonstrate a clear and credible path to reaching the 1.3 trillion US dollars a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, as agreed at COP 29 in Baku.

Developed countries must take the lead in mobilizing 300 billion dollars annually – delivering affordable, predictable finance at the agreed scale.

All providers must show they will contribute to meeting the 300 billion and 1.3 trillion milestones.

It’s no longer time for negotiations.

It’s time for implementation, implementation and implementation.

With independent tracking, faster disbursement, and terms that reflect climate vulnerability – including debt relief.

And third – developing countries must leave Belém equipped with a climate justice package that delivers equity, dignity, and opportunity.

That means a concrete plan to close the adaptation finance gap:

Ensuring that developed countries honour their pledge to provide 40 billion US dollars adaptation finance by the end of this year;

And giving confidence that affordable adaptation finance will be scaled up beyond 2025 – and delivered swiftly to the communities on the frontlines.

It also means placing justice at the heart of the transition.

With concrete measures to support developing countries to navigate it – protecting workers, empowering communities, and creating new opportunities;

And significant contributions and simplified access to the Loss and Damage Fund.

A just transition also means Indigenous Peoples leading the way.

Their knowledge and full participation light the path to a livable planet.

Excellencies,

You can count on the United Nations.

Through our Climate Promise, over a hundred developing countries received support in the preparation of their new nationally determined contributions.

I have directed the United Nations Development Programme to build on this architecture and work across the system to support developing countries during the implementation plan.

The challenge is immense.

But the choices are clear.

No one can bargain with physics.

But we can choose to lead – or be led to ruin.

Choose to make Belém the turning point.

Stand with science.

Stand for justice.

Stand for future generations.

Thank you.

Excellencies, Excelências,

I would like to thank President Lula, the COP President, and the Government and people of Brazil for their warm hospitality in Belém.

,North Carolina Clean Energy,2025-11-06 15:33:04+00:00,World Socialist Web Site,"Australia: Rio Tinto threatens to close Tomago Aluminium smelter, destroying over 1000 jobs",Not Available,,,,,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/11/06/alkr-n06.html,"Last week, Tomago Aluminium announced it is preparing to shut down its smelter, north of Newcastle, by the end of 2028, destroying more than 1,000 jobs and devastating the region.
The Tomago plant operates around the clock, consuming roughly 10 percent of the entire NSW electricity grid.
The threat of closure is being used by Rio Tinto to leverage further concessions from the Australian government.
Workers at Tomago should place no faith in Rio Tinto, the state and federal governments or the unions, whatever the immediate outcome of the present discussions.
Moreover, to wage a fight against global corporations such as Rio Tinto, workers need to think and act globally, establishing ties with workers around the world hit by its continual restructuring in search of greater profits.","Last week, Tomago Aluminium announced it is preparing to shut down its smelter, north of Newcastle, by the end of 2028, destroying more than 1,000 jobs and devastating the region. Management insists the plant cannot remain viable once its 40-year electricity contract with AGL’s Bayswater power station expires, pointing out that power makes up more than 40 percent of total costs.

Located about 160 kilometres north of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales (NSW), the threatened closure could result in a further 5,000 job losses through flow-on effects to local businesses and manufacturing. The regional economy has already been gutted by decades of industrial closures and layoffs.

Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining conglomerates worth around $180 billion, holds the majority stake in Tomago through a joint venture with CSR Limited and Hydro Aluminium, a subsidiary of Norway’s state-linked Norsk Hydro.

Tomago’s chief executive officer Jerome Dozol said “consultations” with workers had already begun over the possible closure, declaring that “all market proposals received so far show future energy prices are not commercially viable” and there was “uncertainty about when renewable projects will be available at the scale we need.”

Aluminium smelting is among the most electricity-intensive industrial processes. The Tomago plant operates around the clock, consuming roughly 10 percent of the entire NSW electricity grid. It produces around 600,000 tonnes of aluminium each year, some 37 percent of Australia’s total output, worth an estimated $2 billion annually.

The threat of closure is being used by Rio Tinto to leverage further concessions from the Australian government. A joint federal–state Labor offer of $1 billion has been rejected by the company, with Dozol indicating that only a long-term deal that secured cheaper power prices would be accepted.

The company has already extracted substantial concessions from the Labor government. In January, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unveiled a $2 billion Green Metals Fund to provide tax credits to subsidise aluminium and steel produced with renewable energy.

The Fund is one aspect of the government’s limited program to address climate change, which aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050—a goal that climate scientists warn will not address the serious consequences of global warming.

The Fund’s announcement was staged at Tomago, where Rio Tinto Australia chief executive Kellie Parker hailed the initiative as securing “a future” for the plant and praised it as “the best smelter in Australia.” She said the new Green Metals Fund would help secure its business for decades to come. Less than a year later, the company is demanding billions more in subsidies to lock in low-cost electricity beyond 2028.

In March and April, amid strikes over an enterprise bargaining deal, the company also pressured workers to accept lower wages, supposedly to guarantee the future of the smelter. In a media statement, Tomago declared its wage offer was made amid “rising energy costs and our long-term investments to decarbonise our plant so that we can continue operating far into the future.”

In response to last week’s announcement, Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres declared that the government was “open to every option” to keep Tomago open, including changes to ownership and further subsidies. Labor clearly fears a further collapse of support in the region, which has already been hit hard by closures and job losses.

Ayres appeared at a press conference alongside four Labor MPs from the Hunter region, assuring workers that the Albanese government was “committed to keeping the plant operating.” Asked how much taxpayer money would be provided, he said he would “exhaust every opportunity,” adding that the process of making Tomago “self-sustaining” would involve government support “for years.”

The trade unions have joined hands with the company in pressuring the federal government to meet the company’s demands. Leigh Shears, secretary of Hunter Workers, the region’s umbrella union organisation, urged the government to “use its balance sheet to secure Tomago the power it needs at the price it needs.”

Brad Pidgeon, state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, described the company’s announcement as “very disappointing.” Effectively accepting the closure as inevitable, he said it “validates the sad news that’s going to occur.”

As Pidgeon admitted, the unions, along with the state and federal governments, have engaged in discussions with Tomago management behind closed doors for months and kept workers in the dark as to the threats of closure. None of the union bureaucrats has so much as hinted at any fight to prevent the shutdown.

As for the company, Dozol declared Tomago was still working with the government and was “very open to have an innovative solution to find a pathway moving forward.” But he emphasised that “a significant change” would be required to prevent the closure—in other words, meet our demands or we will close.

Last year, Rio Tinto strong-armed the Queensland Labor government into a “partnership” agreement to keep its Boyne Island aluminium smelter open on the basis of subsidised renewable energy from 2029. The cost was not disclosed, but it will be borne by the working class through cutbacks to essential services including education and health, as well as the jobs, wages and conditions of public sector workers.

What is happening at Tomago follows a well-worn pattern. For decades, major corporations have used the threat of closing down and moving their operations elsewhere to extract government subsidies and financial assistance to the tune of billions of dollars, and, in league with the trade unions, to demand ever-greater productivity from fewer and fewer workers in the name of “international competitiveness.” It is a never-ending process that has ultimately ended in devastating closures and job losses.

In the Hunter region, the most dramatic example was the closure of the Newcastle steelworks. The Hawke Labor government, with the backing of the unions, drew up the 1984–88 Steel Industry Plan, which provided BHP with $800 million in subsidies and tax concessions, (worth roughly $3.1 billion today), to “save” the industry. In return, the unions enforced mass sackings and wage restraint.

Steel employment in Newcastle was more than 12,000 in the early 1980s, but was slashed again and again over the next decade and a half. Despite years of public subsidies, BHP finally shut the steelworks in 1999, destroying the remaining 2,500 jobs overnight and wiping out tens of thousands indirectly.

The same pattern was repeated in the car industry under the Labor government’s Button car plan. For decades, Ford, Holden, Toyota and Mitsubishi extracted billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks from successive Labor and Liberal governments, while the unions helped slash jobs and conditions. As profit margins fell, however, all four companies shut their Australian plants, destroying the whole car industry and leaving entire working-class communities in ruins.

Workers at Tomago should place no faith in Rio Tinto, the state and federal governments or the unions, whatever the immediate outcome of the present discussions. To fight the closure, workers need to establish a democratically elected rank-and-file committee, independent of the trade unions, to discuss, plan and execute their own industrial and political campaign.

An immediate task should be to reach out to the thousands of workers in other plants who are facing similar threats, including in this region the closure of Bayswater power station and Molycop steelworks. More broadly, workers at Glencore’s Mt Isa copper mill, the Whyalla Steelworks, Nyrstar’s zinc and lead smelters and Rio Tinto’s Bell Bay aluminium plant all face the same tenuous future, after these companies have been handed huge government subsidies that will only keep operations going in the short term. Moreover, to wage a fight against global corporations such as Rio Tinto, workers need to think and act globally, establishing ties with workers around the world hit by its continual restructuring in search of greater profits.

A new political strategy is also needed. The trade unions all declare that nothing else can be done but to bow to the profit-driven demands of these major corporations and the anarchy of the capitalist market. But if Rio Tinto is incapable of keeping the Tomago smelter open then it should be nationalised, without compensation, under the democratic control of the working class, which, after all, built it and ran it for decades. That is what the Socialist Equality Party advocates as part of its fight for the socialist reorganisation of society from top to bottom to meet the pressing needs of the vast majority of working people, not the enormous profits of the wealthy few.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/3eb95b40-b390-481b-bdec-4da421f8ac0a?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-11-06 14:06:45.137747

In September, Centrus Energy announced a plan to significantly expand its uranium enrichment plant in the town of Piketon.

More details: DeWine announced these plans in partnership with JobsOhio—a private nonprofit economic development corporation that focuses on bolstering a variety of Ohio industries—at the Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Summit last week.

There, he laid out that the fund would provide grants and low-interest loans to help offset natural gas– and nuclear power production–related costs. He also specified that the funding will work to ensure that Ohio has “the supply we need for current and future demand, which will help keep costs reasonable.”

The announcement laid out four pillars of funding:

Engineering, right-of-way, and construction for new and existing natural gas infrastructure.

Site preparation for SMR generation.

Advanced workforce training and the creation of a “nuclear energy center of excellence” around employment.

Incentives for attracting supply-chain companies for SMR manufacturing and production.

Amir Vexler, president and CEO of Centrus Energy, said that DeWine’s focus on new workforce development will be particularly critical for facilitating Centrus’s expansion plans.

In his remarks during the Roundtable event, DeWine added that this funding slots in with his broader, ongoing work to accelerate natural gas and nuclear deployment in the state. He specifically called out his signing of H.B. 15 in May as critical legislation to expedite new projects and pointed to his collaboration with PJM to create a separate, prioritized review queue for natural gas and nuclear projects that takes precedence over renewable projects.

Finally, DeWine said that new nuclear development builds on a rich nuclear history in Ohio and a robust supply chain.

The main point of the town hall was to answer union members' questions and to discuss plant closures across the nation, along with a contract with Volkswagen.

One of the plants discussed included the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown.

It was announced on Wednesday, October 29, that several thousand jobs would be cut at Ultium Cells locations throughout the country.

Some cuts included the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown, cutting 550 jobs, with an additional 850 positions planned to be laid off.

The Ultium Cells plant, a joint venture between GM and Ultium Cells, manufactures battery cells to be used in electric vehicles.

The decision to cut jobs and plan further layoffs is a move by General Motors (GM), reportedly aiming to adjust its electric vehicle (EV) capacity in response to a slowing demand for electric vehicles in the United States.

During the virtual town hall, Fain recognized that the EV industry is weaker than before, with certain decisions made in Washington, D.C. He shared some statistics on three of the top vehicle manufacturing companies profit expectations, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

Fain went on to state that GM just raised its expectations of profit for the 2025 year.

""GM just raised [its] operating profit expectations for the year to $13 billion... So, as we've said for years, the money's there. We just need to fight for our fair share,"" said Fain.

Fain continued,"" Just last week, as you all know, General Motors, when they announced profits for the quarter that exceeded expectations, at the same time, they announced over 3,000 layoffs at six facilities.""

Fain goes on to say that the union has been in conversations with GM, who say they do not plan to give up the EV business.

Fain went on to reiterate his earlier point on the GM company raising profit expectations for the year, while also announcing over 3,000 cuts to jobs across several Ultium Cells facilities.

""It tells me that layoffs are a choice. As long as they're making money, as long as their CEO is getting paid, as long as they're paying off Wall Street - it's a choice they're making as a company,"" said Fain.

For employees affected by the cuts and layoffs, a job fair is planned to help connect area employers to prospective employees.

The job fair will be held on November 18 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the library on Kent State University's Trumbull County campus.

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

Up to $1,200 off home weatherization

Weatherization — insulation, sealing cracks, upgrading windows and doors — helps keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and lowers monthly electricity bills.

Details: People can get 30% off of equipment (not labor) up to:

$1,200 for insulation and air sealing

$500 for exterior doors (limit $250 per door)

$600 for exterior windows and skylights

If you’re both weatherizing and upgrading your panel, the total cost cap is $1,200.

Up to $150 on a ‘home energy audit’

A building energy audit is like a “physical for your home,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Contractors take a comprehensive look at home energy use, find leaks, and recommend improvements.

Details: People can get up to $150 back.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

The commercial partnership between Copec WIND Ventures and Moment will deploy gigawatt-hours of second-life battery energy storage projects across Latin America and Europe as part of purportedly one of the largest EV fleet repurposing initiatives outside China.

Moment and Copec will repurpose batteries from Chile’s electric bus fleet—the second-largest globally—to deploy 45MWh of near-term projects across commercial and industrial applications, with an additional 300MWh to follow.

Moment Energy has raised almost US$60 million to date, it said, including investments from the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Voyager Ventures and now Copec WIND Ventures, along with more than US$30 million in non-dilutive funding from the US and Canadian governments.

The Copec WIND Ventures funding is intended as a step towards establishing a domestic second-life battery supply chain in Latin America and Europe.

Brian Walsh, head of Copec WIND Ventures, said the firm sees a “looming supply gap” for energy storage as lithium-ion manufacturing is focused on EVs.

In July of this year, Moment Energy’s second-life battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing hub in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, reached full-scale production. The company said it will deliver 5.6GWh across North America.

The facility produces Moment’s Luna BESS, a 400kWh/1MWh unit that can be scaled into 10MWh, which the company said is the first repurposed battery system to achieve all key safety milestones: the UL 1973, UL 9540 and UL 9540A certifications.

In 2024 he opened a franchise of Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions serving Berks, Chester, and Lancaster counties offering a specialized cooking oil micro-filtration process.

“After 27 years with Comcast Cable I was let go three years ago, and I just didn’t want to go back into corporate America,” O’Connor said. “I looked into franchises, and this was brought to me. I liked that it was a service industry and doing something good for the environment.”

Since he started the business, O’Connor said he has helped to recycle over 164,400 pounds of oil across local institutions like Kutztown University, West Chester University and Penn State Health – allowing them to reduce costs and improve the quality of the oil they use in their fryers.

O’Connor described the process as dialysis but for cooking oil where his staff goes into universities, hospitals and restaurants to micro-filtrate cooking oil to extend its lifespan and make food taste better.

Then when the cooking oil has reached the end of its reusability, Filta ultimately recycles that cooking oil into biodiesel fuel.

He said at Kutztown University, for example, he is contracted to filter 16 fryers in different parts of the campus that are run by Aramark food service.

There the fryers are cleaned once a week, but some customers have Filta come in two or three times a week based on their need.

What his staff does is basically filter, drain and dump. Oil is sucked into a three-filter machine while they scrub and clean the fryer.

“This practice elongates the life of the oil,” O’Conner said. “Oil is expensive and we offset that with our service.”

For oil that can no longer be used for cooking, staff take the oil back to the warehouse for storage where it is ultimately sold to be used as biofuel.

O’Connor said Filta’s local work alone has kept thousands of gallons of waste oil out of landfills. He makes sure all clients are aware of the ultimate environmental impact of using his service, by providing them with an environmental impact and sustainability report.

The report shows the customers such things as their carbon offset and packaging and transportation savings.

Some who have opposed the large-scale renewable energy projects have been threatened, displaced or even killed.
Despite renewable energy projects taking off in the past decade, some experts and activists say there’s no energy transition in Honduras.
Gabriela Ramírez says there’s a lot of misinformation in local communities about the impacts of renewable energy projects.
Cárcamo says that, historically, “energy projects in Honduras have been done without any respect for the local communities.","CHOLUTECA, Honduras — Under the slogan “Without human rights, there is no energy sovereignty,” more than 100 community members and activists gathered in mid-July at the Casa Real Hotel in Choluteca, a city in southern Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. At the event, participants — a mix of nonprofit leaders and community members — questioned the fairness of large-scale renewable energy projects in their territories, claiming the projects leave them without water and forests, and exposed to extreme heat. Yet reliable data on the impacts of renewable energy projects in southern Honduras remain scarce.

In Honduras, where fossil fuels account for about 38% of the electricity supply, and where the World Bank estimates that about 1.4 million people lack access to electricity, experts told Mongabay that there’s an urgent need for an energy transition. That need will grow as the climate warms and national energy demand rises by a projected 39% from 2025 to 2035.

Yet, community members in southern Honduras say large renewable energy projects come at the expense of the environment and of their well-being. They blame solar, wind and hydroelectric projects for deforestation, droughts and floods, and describe unbearable temperatures near solar farms. Some who have opposed the large-scale renewable energy projects have been threatened, displaced or even killed. Families living adjacent to solar projects in Choluteca report still lacking access to electricity. Many say they don’t feel the benefits of the energy transition; they either pay high prices for power or remain without, while the jobs and income promised by companies have failed to materialize.

One of the projects facing resistance is the Choluteca solar park, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Choluteca city. Long stretches of solar panels are laid out in rows across dozens of hectares. The solar park has three solar photovoltaic power plants with total generating capacity of 81.7 megawatts, equivalent to about 5% of Honduras’s peak electricity demand. The $146 million project was developed by U.S. company SunEdison Inc. in 2014 and funded through loans from multilateral bodies. The project is now operated by the Guatemalan multinational Corporación Multi Inversiones, after SunEdison filed for bankruptcy in 2016.

Energy woes in the south

Located in Central America’s Dry Corridor, Choluteca is one of the Honduran departments increasingly affected by drought and severe water stress. Historically, the south has always been drought-prone, but the situation has worsened with the loss of tree cover and intensifying impacts of climate change, according to Laura Palmese, executive director of the Environmental Law Institute of Honduras, a local NGO.

Choluteca and other departments in Honduras’s poorer south supply most of the electricity that flows to the country’s industrial northwest, to cities like San Pedro Sula. Just 18 of 259 municipalities account for about 80% of the country’s electrical consumption. Meanwhile, many citizens in the rural south live in energy poverty. While 98% of urban households have electricity, in rural areas only 69% are connected to the grid, while 22% have no electricity at all.

“The energy produced in the south is not for the local communities, rather, it is sent north,” says Mónica Torres, a project coordinator at the Honduras office of German nonprofit Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung.

Solar energy from Choluteca costs about 15 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, as stipulated by the 2014 contracts with solar companies; the regional average in Latin America is about 11 cents/kWh.

Gonzalo Fernández Ortiz de Zárate, coordinator of the Observatory of Multinationals in Latin America (OMAL), attributes the higher electricity prices in part to the 23 solar contracts awarded in 2014, which locked state-owned electric utility ENEE into paying some of the highest tariffs in the region, contributing to the company’s mounting debt problem. In 2024, the Honduran government renegotiated 18 of the contracts to bring prices down, but some affected companies refused to renegotiate and instead took the Honduran government to international arbitration using a controversial investor dispute settlement mechanism to claim compensation. Corporations’ claims from the electricity sector alone amount to more than $1.6 billion. However, in late October, Norwegian solar companies dropped some of the arbitrations against the Honduran government. The reasons for discontinuing the arbitrations are unknown, but cause concern amongst some activists, sources tell Mongabay.

“The problem in Honduras is not about production, it’s about distribution,” says Lucía Vijil, adviser on environmental and ecological justice at Center for the Study of Democracy (CESPAD) at a meeting in Tegucigalpa, the country’s capital.

Honduras’s energy system is also highly inefficient; in 2022, 38% of all energy produced was lost, compared to losses of 10% in El Salvador that same year, or 14% in Guatemala in 2021.

“The solar energy from the south can still not enter the system,” Vijil says.

Experts say high transmission and distribution losses further contribute to high prices.

Jorge Cárcamo, national director of energy planning and sectorial energy policy at the Honduran Ministry of Energy, agrees that low energy efficiency and a poor transmission network are among the main challenges in Honduras’s energy system.

“The current transmission grid in Honduras is extremely obsolete. It has been many decades since it was built, and the investment … in its maintenance and updating has been, at best, negligent,” he tells Mongabay in a video call. He adds that in 2021, the government created an educational program to improve citizens’ energy efficiency, and in 2022, rolled out a national program to reduce energy losses.

By 2038, the Honduran government aims to boost the share of renewables in electricity generation from about 60% to 80%. Between 2010 and 2021, the share of electricity from solar power went from nearly zero to 19%. Cárcamo says Honduras has a very high potential for renewable energy generation, especially from solar, wind and hydropower.

“The south of Honduras has the highest solar energy potential in all of the country,” he adds.

Despite renewable energy projects taking off in the past decade, some experts and activists say there’s no energy transition in Honduras.

“We cannot talk about having a policy for green transition,” says Palmese from the Environmental Law Institute. Instead, she says, the government continues to bet on oil extraction as a form of development. In 2023, about 38% of Honduras’s electricity was generated by fossil fuels. OMAL’s Fernández Ortiz de Zárate agrees, saying the government “is betting as much on fossil fuels as [on] renewables,” and that there’s no real planning to phase out the former in favor of the latter.

Community concerns

“In 2014, machinery came in and destroyed our flora and fauna. We didn’t know why,” says Jorge Maradiaga, a community leader in La Fortunita del Carrizo, a municipality in Choluteca.

That marked the arrival of one of the many solar projects in the Choluteca department. Since that solar farm was installed, Maradiaga says, the creek in his community has been drying out due to higher temperatures and water use. His community has grown almost unbearably hot and humid, he adds. But while temperatures tend to be higher near solar farms, experts point out that Choluteca is part of Central America’s Dry Corridor and that rising temperatures are part of a regional trend, not attributable to solar parks.

In southern Honduras, “there is a lack of water, there is a lot of drought, there is extreme heat and floods, but not because of renewable energy projects,” says Alejandra Gabriela Ramírez, an environmental engineer based in Tegucigalpa. “Extreme heat has increased due to climate change.”

Maradiaga says the solar companies promised jobs and development, but hired few locals. Instead, he says, the solar projects have wiped out a key source of income: calabash trees (Crescentia cujete) and their fruits.

“We want to cultivate, but we can no longer do that due to the high temperatures. It’s so dry, the crops don’t grow anymore.” Maradiaga adds the solar companies are “enriching the ones who already have money, not our communities.”

Companies often tell local communities that their renewable energy projects will generate jobs and cheaper energy for them, says Germán Chirinos, coordinator of the Southern Social Environmentalist Movement (MASSVIDA), a grassroots advocacy group in southern Honduras. “How is it possible that here in Choluteca there are so many projects of solar, wind and other renewable energy projects, and yet we have such expensive energy and some people don’t even have access to it?” he says.

Communities along Honduras’s Caribbean coast share similar frustrations.

“The transition has not been fair, nor democratic,” says Rony Castillo, a member of the executive team at the Honduran Black Fraternal Organization (Ofraneh), a grassroots group defending the rights and territories of the Garífuna people. “We thought renewable energy was going to be cheaper, better for the environment, and that we would have access to energy. But we don’t have energy, we have more killings and more criminalization.”

Cárcamo, from the energy ministry, says the current situation, where some communities living next to big energy projects don’t have access to electricity, “is illogical.” He says the government is trying to expand its distribution network to those communities or help them build micro networks to produce and consume electricity locally. He also says the government is exploring ways to require new energy projects to ensure access for local communities.

Community members often feel excluded and lack both information and a voice in decisions, according to Chirinos. Honduran law requires that local communities be consulted before the start of projects that could degrade the environment, but community activists say such consultations are often incomplete or poorly implemented. Maradiaga says that in his community’s case, they asked the solar company to show the record of prior socialization, “and they had nothing”.

Gabriela Ramírez says there’s a lot of misinformation in local communities about the impacts of renewable energy projects. She adds that “communities need to be taken into account and properly informed about the renewable energy projects.”

A consultant who worked on environmental evaluations and engagement with communities for a large renewable energy company in Honduras, and asks not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on behalf of the company, says communities often “generalize and confuse companies.”

The consultant says their company complies with regulation, “even though the government doesn’t audit us [companies] as it should. The government doesn’t demand from us what it should in terms of complying with the law.” The consultant says community councils often sign agreements in which they agree to the renewable energy projects without consulting with their own community members, contributing to social conflict. The consultant suggests having representatives from the municipal or departmental governments present at meetings could help legitimize the processes, but notes that local governments often don’t have the funds to send representatives to attend such meetings.

Cárcamo says that, historically, “energy projects in Honduras have been done without any respect for the local communities. This has brought a lot of problems today, because they no longer trust in the government.”

Maradiaga says he worries about what will happen 20 to 30 years from now, when the solar panels reach the end of their lifespan. “Where will all these materials that they no longer use go?” he says.

Torres, from Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, says that “what is left is the trash, not the benefits.”

When community members resist large energy projects, they risk being threatened or even attacked, according to human rights defenders. Maradiaga says he’s experienced this firsthand, in the form of anonymous calls telling him to accept money and stop resisting a local solar project. According to advocacy group Global Witness, six environmental defenders were killed in Honduras in 2024 for their work, making it the sixth deadliest country in the world for such defenders.

“There is no rule of law” in Honduras, says Ligia Ramos, a Honduran congresswoman. She says it’s important to strengthen Honduras’s justice system to protect environmental defenders.

Environmental impacts

At the community event in Choluteca, most locals complain about the deforestation of their territories to make way for the renewable energy projects. A 2014 environmental impact assessment by the Honduran renewable energy company Soluciones Energéticas Renovables S.A de C.V. prior to the start of the Choluteca II project says it was established on lands that were already deforested. But testimonies from local experts and community members paint a different picture.

“There is just no way that they didn’t cut down trees, I just don’t believe that,” says Karen Spring, a coordinator for the Honduras Solidarity Network, about the claims that solar projects in Choluteca didn’t involve deforestation. She adds that while poor people risk arrests or fines for cutting trees illegally, companies that come in and cut trees are treated very differently.

“I know there’s been deforestation, of course they had to remove everything that was on the ground,” says Palmese about the renewable energy companies that operate in Choluteca and other parts of southern Honduras. “It is very difficult to find an area where everything is ready [for renewables], where there wasn’t anything at all.”

Torres and CESPAD’s Vijil say there’s a big data problem in Honduras, where local testimonies are often the only evidence to support claims of environmental harm. “Presenting the evidence could be a death sentence,” Vijil says, and “institutions provide no support.”

Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says that although there’s a direct link between deforestation and renewables, the latter isn’t the main driver of Honduras’s deforestation. Between 2001 and 2024, Honduras lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover, according to Global Forest Watch. The biggest driver by far is permanent agriculture (88.6%), followed by shifting cultivation (4.7%) and wildfires (4%). According to Fernández Ortiz de Zárate, using wood to generate energy – as it’s often the case in Honduras – is much worse for forests than using solar panels. However, mega projects like the ones in Choluteca will always imply some tree cutting, he says.

Rafael Gómez, a project director at Honduras’s National Institute of Forest Conservation (ICF), says solar farms need to be built on flat land, and therefore usually occupy spaces that have already been deforested. He says renewable energy projects “are not significant” as a driver of deforestation in Honduras.

“We cannot compare it with the advancement of livestock farming. Nor can we compare it with the progress of migratory agriculture. Likewise, we cannot compare it with the growth or development of communities — cities and towns continue to expand into forested areas,” Gómez says.

Renewable projects in Honduras often lack not only prior social consultations, but also proper environmental impact studies before they’re developed, according to Palmese. Honduran national law defines four types of projects, only one of which requires an environmental study. Palmese says this “is very concerning.” She says the legal regime has been made more flexible without the necessary controls to ensure that renewable projects don’t harm the environment.

Palmese also says environmental impact studies and social consultations, when they’re done, are often unreliable. She points out that the consultants who carry out the studies are paid directly by the project developers and thus have an interest in downplaying negative impacts in order to allow for new projects.

A different energy transition?

Despite the challenges, an energy transition in Honduras and other Central American countries is necessary to mitigate the climate crisis and because fossil fuels will run out, says Fernández Ortiz de Zárate. But he adds it’s also necessary for the world to find ways to use less energy and materials.

He says frequent blackouts and a mismatch between supply and demand have created an energy emergency in Honduras. As one of the poorest countries in the region and with a history of elite capture and political corruption, it’s particularly hard for Honduras to push the energy transition, Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says.

He adds the question for Honduras isn’t whether there should be an energy transition, but how it should be done. He criticizes mining and renewable mega projects that he says are done without prior consultation, by appropriating lands and water, degrading ecosystems, and without agreement from local communities, who instead are criminalized or even killed.

Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says Honduras should instead focus more on small-scale renewable projects that align with community needs. Spring says she agrees, adding that “renewables on a small scale would be fantastic, like installing 4-5 hectares [10-12 acres] of panels next to poor communities.”

“We need an energy transition, but not one that will compromise people’s daily lives,” says Ramos, the congresswoman.

According to Gómez, Honduras should make regulations that counteract the impacts of the growing number of solar farms. He suggests that all owners of solar farms set aside areas for forest conservation. He also calls for regulating permits and environmental licenses to require renewable companies to plant trees.

“For example, if we are going to grant you permission to develop a certain area of solar panels, you must triple that area in forest management within the country or within the same zone where the project is located. That could be one of the actions,” Gómez says.

Multilateral development lenders like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Inter-American Development Bank currently support various large-scale renewables projects across Central America.

“It is hard to understate the role of development finance institutions like the IFC in funding and creating legal frameworks that move countries like Honduras in the so-called energy transition away from fossil fuels towards solar, wind, hydro and biothermal,” Spring says.

The IFC and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) helped finance the Choluteca Solar I and II projects. According to Spring, the IFC also helped create the legal framework for large-scale private sector projects to be implemented in Choluteca and other parts of southern Honduras.

Ramos says it’s important to push for diligent environmental impact studies and prior consultation and involvement with local communities. Experts say there’s also a need to strengthen Honduran institutions to build the capacity to review and investigate large-scale renewable energy projects properly before they start.

Ratifying the Escazú Agreement, a Latin American treaty on environmental rights and defender protection, could be part of the solution, according to Palmese, Vijil and Torres. They argue that its ratification would oblige the Honduran government to make information on renewables projects and their environmental impacts publicly accessible. It would also help protect Honduras’s environmental defenders. Palmese says given the difficulty of accessing information in Tegucigalpa, the capital, “then I don’t imagine how difficult it can be in Choluteca.”

In a recent bipartisan letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) urged the agency to reconsider its pending repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

EPA’s proposed rule, released in September, would remove all the emissions reporting requirements under the GHGRP, except for those subject to the methane emissions tax starting in 2034 as codified in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Eliminating this reporting requirement would make it more difficult to enact informed public policy and could further complicate the federal government’s ability to determine eligibility for certain tax credits.

Introduction

In a recent bipartisan letter to the Environmental Protection Agency, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) urged the agency to reconsider its pending repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The senators highlighted the importance of ensuring sufficient and accurate emissions data gathering, noting: “[W]e support the collection of information that improves the global competitiveness of American industry.”

EPA’s proposed rule, released in September, would remove all the emissions reporting requirements under the GHGRP, except for those subject to the methane emissions tax starting in 2034 as codified in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). This action is part of the Trump Administration’s broad energy agenda to boost U.S. oil and gas production by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulating barriers, and expediting permitting approvals for fossil fuel projects. The EPA estimated that the proposed rule would save $303 million per year from 2025–2033, totaling about $2 billion over 10 years for businesses that are required to report to the program

Eliminating this reporting requirement would make it more difficult to enact informed public policy and could further complicate the federal government’s ability to determine eligibility for certain tax credits.

Overview of the GHGRP

The GHGRP, which went into effect in 2009, mandated certain manufacturing facilities to report their GHG emissions annually and follow monitoring, verification, and recordkeeping requirements. It covers GHG emissions from 47 source categories across about 8,000 facilities in the United States and publishes emissions data in October each year.

EPA’s website states that the data collected through the program “can be used by businesses and others to track and compare facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, minimize wasted energy, and save money. States, cities, and other communities can use EPA’s greenhouse gas data to find high-emitting facilities in their area, compare emissions between similar facilities, and develop common-sense climate policies.”

Under the program, facilities are required to submit information on their emissions if:

A facility emits more than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e annually;

Supply of certain products would lead to over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e if those products are released, combusted, or oxidized; or

A facility receives 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e for underground injection, which is the final step in carbon capture and sequestration.

EPA’s Proposal To Cancel the Program

On September 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposed rule to remove the GHGRP’s emissions reporting requirements, except for those subject to the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) set the WEC, a tax on methane emissions, to begin in 2024, but the 2025 OBBBA postponed the implementation of the tax until 2034. This action is part of the Trump Administration’s broad energy agenda to boost U.S. oil and gas production by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulating barriers, and expediting permitting approvals for fossil fuel projects.

EPA’s press release on its decision to repeal the program states the following:

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites.”

The EPA estimated that the proposed rule would save $303 million per year from 2025–2033, totaling about $2 billion over 10 years. Of the cost savings, more than 80 percent is associated with a reduced burden on the petroleum and natural gas industry, with the rest benefiting carbon-intensive manufacturing industries.

Implications of Removing the Program

While the EPA’s proposed cancellation of the GHGRP would significantly reduce costs for businesses that are required to report to the program, there are some potential downsides to the action.

Repealing the GHGRP would deprive U.S. policymakers of critical emissions data for designing decarbonization policies. Lawmakers and the federal government rely on economic data such as employment and manufacturing statistics to make important economic policy decisions. Similarly, they depend on the GHGRP’s regularly updated and comparable emissions data to learn about the emissions trajectory of various sectors in the economy. Absent a government accredited repository of emissions data, the private sector would have to fill in the gap. But there are limits in the scope and quality of the data collected by the private sector given constrained resources.

Scrapping the GHGRP would also create challenges for taxpayers to claim the OBBBA’s carbon sequestration tax credits since the program’s emissions data is used to determine eligibility. Although the OBBBA repealed about 60 percent of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, it retained the carbon oxide sequestration credit. Senators Whitehouse and Cramer’s letter to the EPA stated: “Repealing [the GHGRP reporting requirements] without a clear alternative in place will put existing investments in flux and stymy future American leadership in [Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage] deployment.” Other senators have raised this issue. For example, Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said in an interview: “If you’re really taking advantage of tax credits, you have to have measurements, and they have to be accessible. That’s unclear at this point.”

Further, rolling back the program would restrict U.S. exporters’ access to facility- and industry-level emissions data, leaving them at a disadvantage as more countries start to adopt carbon border adjustments—a policy that aims to address emissions embedded in internationally traded goods. For example, the European Union (EU) will start to implement its carbon border adjustment mechanism to levy a tax on certain imported goods based on their associated carbon emissions. If the GHGRP is eliminated, U.S. exporters subject to the regulation would need to switch to other credible entities to have their emissions data validated. Some U.S. legislative proposals that have carbon border adjustment components, such as the Clean Competition Act and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act, also rely on the GHGRP to calculate covered goods’ emissions.

Finally, canceling the GHGRP would remove a credible emissions measuring and reporting standard applicable to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters. Oil and gas companies worldwide regularly measure and estimate the GHG emissions associated with their production to comply with different jurisdictions’ emissions regulations. For example, in January 2027 the EU will start enforcing its methane regulation requiring methane monitoring, reporting, and verification on the gas sold to the EU market. Some hope this regulation would exempt U.S. LNG exporters since they are subject to the GHGRP standards. With the GHGRP on the chopping block, however, U.S.LNG exporters would have to incur additional costs to conform to the EU standards.

In this article, we model two hypothetical infrastructure development plans for the Appalachian Basin—northward pipeline expansion and southward pipeline expansion—and compare them to a baseline scenario.
One scenario explores pipeline expansion northward (toward the Boston and New York areas), and the other southward (toward the Atlantic corridor urban centers and the USGC).
Natural gas pipeline expansion is a critical tool for meeting the dual goals of supplying growing demand for gas and maintaining downward pressure on pricing.
Will gas pipeline infrastructure expansion bring a reliable supply to the emerging data center demand in the Northeast (for example, Virginia)?","Over the past decade, North America’s shale revolution unlocked vast reserves of low-cost natural gas. While these supply sources are spread out across the continent, roughly 75 percent of natural gas production growth in 2014–24 came from three basins: Appalachia (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), Haynesville (North Louisiana), and Permian (West Texas).

This growth was enabled by midstream players constructing pipelines to link these supply basins with demand centers, effectively stabilizing Henry Hub prices between $2.50 and $3.00 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) (see sidebar “Sources of North America’s historical natural gas supply growth”).

However, this era of rapid midstream infrastructure growth has come to an end, especially in the US Northeast, at a time when natural gas demand is projected to rise significantly. Our analysis suggests that US demand (including domestic consumption and net exports) could potentially reach 125 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by 2030, an increase of 14 percent compared to 109 bcfd in 2024, driven by increased power demand due to electrification, the rise of data centers, and a growing global liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. These same factors are expected to further increase demand throughout the 2030s.

With the gas distribution network already constrained, the US gas market could face supply bottlenecks, price volatility, and a growing dependence on higher-cost supply basins. US operators would need to expand the current natural gas infrastructure network to overcome these challenges.

In many regions of the United States, project execution is a considerable challenge. In particular, the Appalachian Basin contains an abundant, low-cost dry gas supply but faces severe pipeline bottlenecks that limit the flow of gas to high-demand markets. Expanding infrastructure in the basin could materially help maintain affordable prices and meet future demand, but would have a range of implications for different stakeholders, from producers to consumers.

In this article, we model two hypothetical infrastructure development plans for the Appalachian Basin—northward pipeline expansion and southward pipeline expansion—and compare them to a baseline scenario. We explore the implications of both scenarios on regional pricing and shifts in gas flows to understand how the value chain might be impacted under each scenario.

Pipeline projects adjacent to the Appalachian Basin could debottleneck parts of the system

Between 2010 and 2024, approximately 15,800 miles of incremental onshore gas pipelines were built across the United States. Of this build-out, only around 18 percent was in Appalachia (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia)—in contrast to 36 percent in Louisiana and Texas. The majority of the build-out occurred before 2018, slowing as key gas corridors became more concentrated and saw increased density.

This slowdown in infrastructure build-out has constrained gas export capacity from the Appalachian Basin and the ability for operators to increase gas production volume. Over the past decade, a number of regional pipeline projects have been proposed with the goal of improving gas flow to local urban demand centers or to the US Gulf Coast (USGC). While most of these proposed projects were not successfully completed, the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), which began construction in 2018, came online in June 2024 (see sidebar “The Mountain Valley Pipeline”).

Although MVP provided a new outlet for gas production and has been operating at more than 80 percent capacity since completion, its broader regional impact on flows and pricing has been mixed because of downstream constraints on the interconnecting Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) (Exhibit 1). For example, at the closest demand market to MVP—Transco Zone 5 in Virginia—gas prices rose immediately prior to MVP being built, then fell straight after the pipeline’s start date, reflecting the anticipation and realized deliveries of new supply volumes.

However, other markets further downstream in the Northeast, such as Algon Gates (Boston) and Transco Zone 6 (New York), continued to follow historical pricing trends, implying that MVP had little to no effect on these markets. Additionally, total natural gas production and prices at supply hubs in the Appalachian Basin remained relatively unchanged in the year after MVP was completed. This indicates that although MVP helped alleviate a local supply constraint (Transco Zone 5), it has not significantly changed the broader regional infrastructure constraints that exist downstream of MVP that lead to higher natural gas prices in cities, such as Boston and New York.

By comparison, other pipeline projects that have successfully debottlenecked supply basins have shown more widespread and sustained impacts on pricing and gas flow. For example, in 2019, gas prices in Waha, the West Texas Permian gas supply basin hub, fell substantially relative to gas prices at Henry Hub, the main USGC demand market hub.

These five months of widening differentials (the difference between demand and supply node prices) were caused by increasing production volumes of associated gas that were unable to leave the basin as existing pipelines were already fully utilized. Gas production continued to grow, even though absolute Waha prices became negative, with some producers having to pay to have their gas volumes taken away (see sidebar “Factors influencing associated gas volumes”).

To alleviate this issue, the Gulf Coast Express (GCX) Pipeline was built to connect Waha to Agua Dulce, a demand market in south Texas near Corpus Christi, adding two bcfd of egress capacity. Immediately after GCX started service in August 2019, Waha pricing increased and the Waha-to-Agua Dulce differential shrank by 55 percent ($1/MMBTU), reflecting the value of Permian producers being able to structurally bring stranded gas volumes to market (Exhibit 2). This pricing effect is typical evidence of a pipeline project’s ability to resolve structural regional imbalances, stabilize prices for end consumers, and improve the business case for producers.

The cycle of pipeline additions in the Permian Basin has repeated multiple times over the past decade. These expansions, including the Double E Pipeline and the Permian Highway Pipeline, have helped alleviate short-term bottlenecks, bringing additional low-cost gas to the USGC and reducing local oversupply at Waha.

MVP, by contrast, was locally helpful for Appalachia but did not achieve the same level of impact as GCX. This was largely a result of system bottlenecks remaining in place downstream of the MVP additions that prevented the gas from reaching additional demand centers. Further pipeline development could help unlock these bottlenecks and create value for Appalachian gas producers and US end consumers.

Potential scenarios for expansion: Northward or southward from Appalachia

We explored two hypothetical development scenarios for pipeline infrastructure build-out from the Appalachian Basin to assess the potential implications for gas flows and pricing across Canada and the United States.

One scenario explores pipeline expansion northward (toward the Boston and New York areas), and the other southward (toward the Atlantic corridor urban centers and the USGC). If realized, these expansion scenarios could create the infrastructure conditions required to bring additional low-cost supply to demand markets as they become more accessible.

While these scenarios are not mutually exclusive, we explore them separately to examine the impact on stakeholders of different development goals: a more domestic, demand-oriented path (northward) and a more export-oriented path (southward). If both pipelines were developed, they could add approximately 7.5 bcfd of egress for Appalachia volumes, which is significantly below the more than 15 bcfd of additional economic supply that we estimate represents Appalachia’s “infrastructure unconstrained” potential.

For comparison, we also highlighted a baseline scenario where capacity remains constrained to the current midstream infrastructure (Exhibit 3).

The Baseline scenario assumes that Appalachian pipeline egress capacity remains constrained through 2030, with only approximately one bcfd of capacity added from 2024 to 2030.

The Southward Expansion scenario assumes a cumulative addition of 4.6 bcfd on top of the baseline from resolving the southbound transmission bottlenecks (through MVP’s Southgate expansion and Transco’s southbound Southeast Supply Enhancement [SESE] project) and possible others such as Texas Gas Transmission’s (TGT) Borealis expansion.

The Northward Expansion scenario assumes expansions to the Algonquin Gas Transmission, the Millennium Pipeline, and the Transco northbound pipelines, cumulatively adding up to around three bcfd to existing capacity.

The modeled results for these two pipeline expansion scenarios suggest that stakeholders across the value chain—upstream producers, midstream operators, and downstream consumers (residential and commercial, LNG, storage providers, and traders)—and across geographies could see distinct and significant impacts, with value pools shifting as a lower-cost gas delivery configuration becomes available.

The Baseline scenario

Our baseline scenario assumes increasing LNG demand out of the USGC, limitations on Appalachian egress capacity, and the Permian-associated gas production plateauing in the long run. All these dynamics are expected in the current market. To meet rising demand under this scenario, gas producers would need to increase drilling activity from higher-cost dry gas basins, potentially resulting in Henry Hub prices increasing by $1/MMBTU (above $4 to $5/MMBTU) through the 2040s.

The Southward Expansion scenario

Expanding southward pipeline capacity by four to five bcfd would enable the same volume of additional, low-cost Appalachian gas to flow along the eastern seaboard for domestic use and USGC LNG export by increasing the utilization of Transco’s southbound, MVP, and TGT pipeline systems (Exhibit 4).

Despite the gas having to travel longer distances from Appalachia to the USGC, the total delivered gas cost is projected to decrease due to lower drilling and completion costs in this scenario. This net reduction in system costs could be passed along to consumers or partially recognized as additional margin by producers. However, should this scenario be realized, producers would need to tread carefully, as excessive price markups could drive consumers back to their local suppliers (in this case, North Louisiana gas production).

Upstream impact: The next highest cost supply along the Gulf Coast would be displaced, improving system capital efficiency, while other supply basins would be unaffected

Bringing Appalachian gas supply to the USGC could directly compete with and displace marginal, higher-cost gas production from local Gulf Coast basins, such as the Haynesville Shale Basin (Exhibit 5). In contrast, supply and price differentials (to Henry Hub) for other supply basins, such as Canada (AECO gas hub) and Permian (Waha gas hub), could remain relatively stable and consistent with the Baseline scenario.

The replacement of high-cost, low-productivity Gulf Coast gas wells with cheaper, more productive Appalachian gas wells could improve overall system capital efficiency. Between 2025 and 2030, this upstream supply shift is projected to reduce drilling and completion costs by between $7 billion to $9 billion, while maintaining the same volume of natural gas production. This represents a potential decrease of around $16 billion in capital deployed to drill wells in the USGC, and an increase of $7 billion to $9 billion in capital deployed by Appalachian producers.

Midstream impact: Overall value pool expands with higher full-year flows

The Southward Expansion scenario would also result in increased connectivity between Atlantic corridor midstream players and Gulf Coast LNG export facilities, shifting an estimated $0.7 billion to $0.9 billion in revenue from USGC-centric midstream players to their Appalachian counterparts. With LNG exports continually operating throughout the year (even amid seasonal pricing variability and occasional ramp-downs during extreme weather events or facility maintenance), these revenues would be realized year-round for pipelines.

End consumer impact: Southeast gas consumers and LNG exporters see notable price benefits

Southern and Mid-Atlantic domestic gas consumers and LNG exporters are projected to see lower gas prices in the Southward Expansion scenario compared to the Baseline scenario, potentially reducing consumer costs by $4 billion to $5 billion from 2025 to 2030.

For example, our modeling suggests hub price differentials to Henry Hub along the Transco and TGT system (for example, Transco Zone 5 South and Virginia) narrow by about $0.1 to $0.2/MMBTU (10 to 15 percent) across seasons as the system gains greater access to lower-cost gas for the end consumer.

If realized, this scenario could also support the United States’ position as a key LNG supplier to global markets by improving USGC cost-competitiveness (through lower feedgas costs) and limiting impacts from increased exports on domestic gas prices.

The Northward Expansion scenario

By contrast, expanding northward pipeline capacity by one to two bcfd would bring low-cost Appalachian gas to key demand centers in the Northeast region (Boston, New York, and Virginia), principally during peak winter demand seasons, by increasing utilization of Transco’s northbound, Millennium’s, and Algonquin’s systems (Exhibit 6).

Upstream impact: Multiple supply basins would see displaced production from Appalachia, improving system capital efficiency, with Canada seeing the largest impact

An influx of Appalachian gas to northeast markets could primarily offset regional imports from other distant supply basins, notably Canada, Mid-Continent (for example, SCOOP/STACK shale plays), and the Rockies (for example, Denver–Julesburg shale plays and Powder River), basins (Exhibit 7). This displacement, while not as high as that in the Southward Expansion scenario, is projected to shift $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of drilling and completions spend by oil and gas operators away from these locations to Appalachia.

The impact of this shift would be greatest during the high-demand winter months. During the summer months, when demand is lower, surplus low-cost Appalachian gas supply could slightly edge out flows from these higher-cost basins along the USGC. Northeast imports from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)—a major natural gas-producing region in Alberta and British Columbia—are expected to be the most affected. In 2024, the WCSB supplied 8.78 bcfd of gas to US markets, accounting for virtually all of Canada’s natural gas exports. Northward expansion from Appalachia could displace about 1.0 to 1.5 bcfd of this Canadian gas.

Midstream impact: Increased seasonal flows on Appalachia pipelines with lower utilization of west-to-east cross-continental systems

Overall system transportation costs serving northeast gas demand could decrease due to increased use of shorter routes transporting gas from Ohio and Pennsylvania over other longer routes from Canada, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

Resulting midstream value pools are projected to expand, particularly for assets carrying these northward volumes, as local flows reorganize and overall regional system utilization increases. However, due to the high seasonal variability in northeast demand (30 to 45 percent higher in winter than in summer), incremental pipeline capacity may not be fully utilized throughout the year, potentially resulting in lower project margins compared to pipelines flowing southward.

End consumer impact: Reduced peak winter prices for end users

In this scenario, northeast consumers could collectively save $2 billion to $3 billion between 2025 and 2030 due to price reductions from lower-cost Appalachian gas. This would primarily benefit urban consumers across residential sectors, as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) users, including power generators and data centers.

A Northward Expansion scenario could also increase energy self-sufficiency for northern US cities and reduce overall energy costs for US consumers, with gas differentials to Henry Hub near key urban centers, such as Iroquois Zone 2 (Albany) and Transco Zone 6 (New York), projected to fall by around $0.2 to $0.3/MMBTU.

Consideration of full value chain impacts is critical for efficient infrastructure development

Under both Appalachian debottlenecking scenarios, the end consumers of natural gas stand to save billions of dollars in costs through the rest of the decade. However, very different consumers stand to benefit in each scenario.

Midstream infrastructure developers and oil and gas operators will need to clearly articulate the specific value of these integrated projects to create societal and governmental buy-in, whether the focus is on improved LNG exports and positioning US supply on the global market, or improved energy self-sufficiency and reducing pricing pressure on the American consumer.

Natural gas pipeline expansion is a critical tool for meeting the dual goals of supplying growing demand for gas and maintaining downward pressure on pricing. However, the significant differences in how capacity additions redistribute value through the system, combined with the challenges of completing regional midstream projects, likely require alignment across the entire value chain to solve.

Assessing the value of these projects will also need to occur while navigating other changes in the US energy system. Regulatory and energy policies are rapidly evolving, shifting the viability and incentive structure around infrastructure development. At the same time, the regional role of energy transition technologies and economic applications in a demand-growth environment is being tested, as projections view an increasing role for most energy sources in the near and medium term.

Many questions remain:

What level and direction of debottlenecking is most critical, given the changing profiles of domestic demand (for example, changes to the Inflation Reduction Act and expected power supply build-out) and LNG markets (such as potential changes to LNG market balances), given US policy shifts?

How can project developers communicate and share value across different stakeholders to improve the likelihood of infrastructure development? How do these values align with policy and societal objectives across political and geographical regions?

What levers are available for different operators to support the expansion of debottlenecking infrastructure and promote working toward a common goal?

How can non-Appalachia producers build resiliency into their development plans when both demand and infrastructure build-out remain uncertain?

Will gas pipeline infrastructure expansion bring a reliable supply to the emerging data center demand in the Northeast (for example, Virginia)?

A coordinated approach among all players could ensure infrastructure investments, not only by addressing immediate needs but also by aligning with long-term market dynamics, fostering resilience and shared growth across the industry.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/the%20infrastructure%20imperative%20who%20benefits%20from%20pipeline%20expansion/thumb-gettyimages-523796934.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 10:00:10.666757

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration.
This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel.
Leveling the Playing Field Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been “extraordinarily active” in 2025, making three significant changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are poised to reshape the biomass-based diesel market.

University of Illinois, Todd Gleason spoke to agricultural economists Dr. Todd Hubbs of Oklahoma State University and Dr. Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois, who outlined how these complex rulings create strong incentives for domestic soybean oil and other feedstocks.

“It has been something this year,” Hubbs said, detailing the EPA’s recent actions.

The changes, which are the focus of a new series of articles by Hubbs and Irwin, include:

June: The EPA finalized the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027.

July: The agency released a comprehensive ruling on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) that had been pending since 2018.

September: The EPA established a new framework for reallocating those SREs.

The Mandate is Growing

Host Todd Gleason clarified that these changes do not impact the 15-billion-gallon component of the RFS, which is generally met by corn-based ethanol. Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).

The mandate for this category is set for a 40% increase, rising from 5.36 billion gallons annually to 7.5 billion gallons by 2027.

A “Messy” Solution to Small Refinery Exemptions

A major part of the EPA’s recent action was resolving the backlog of SREs, which allow small refineries to get out of the RFS mandate.

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration. For the exemptions it did grant (covering 2018-2022), the agency returned “worthless” RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers, or credits) from those past years, rather than current, valuable RINs. This effectively removed those credits from the marketplace.

“That’s a mess,” Hubbs said, summarizing the complex situation.

Crucially, the EPA’s new “reallocation” policy means that the exempted gallons will be added back into the RFS, making other, non-exempt obligated parties responsible for making up the difference in 2026 and 2027.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel. Hubbs projects the mandate could jump from 5.5 billion RIN gallons in 2025 to over 7.23 billion in 2026.

“Half-RIN” Policy Favors Domestic Production

Perhaps the most significant change, according to Hubbs, was the introduction of a “half-RIN policy” in June, which he described as “unheard of previously.”

Under this new rule, any imported fuel or imported feedstock used to make fuel will only receive half the RIN value.

“Well, that sort of totally favors it, right?” Gleason asked.

Hubbs agreed, noting the policy “sort of favors domestic feedstock and domestic production” and has “big implications” for U.S. producers.

Leveling the Playing Field

Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.

The agency lowered the RIN value for non-ester renewable diesel (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF) from 1.7 RINs per gallon down to 1.6. This brings it closer to traditional FAME (soy diesel), which has a 1.5 RINs-per-gallon value.

Hubbs and Irwin plan to release additional articles detailing the implications of these changes for feedstock prices as they continue to analyze the new RFS playbook.

The Q3 2025 US Energy Storage Monitor from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) noted that “Q2 2025 marked a new high for US utility-scale energy storage with 4.9GW/15GWh installed, a 63% year-on-year increase.","Construction at Pioneer is in full swing, and commercial operation is expected to start by April 2027.

In July, according to the Arizona Corporation Commission, for the third year in a row, electric utilities in the state set new records for peak energy demand.

On 9 July, APS recorded a peak demand of 8,527MW, while utility Salt River Project (SRP) recorded 8,324MW on the same day. This surpassed the records of 2024, which were 8,212MW and 8,205MW, respectively.

During the Arizona Corporation Commission’s 2025 Summer Preparedness Workshop, SRP and APS assured the Commission that they are capable of generating over 24,000MW of electricity combined to meet the daily summer demands of customers.

Both SRP and APS make regular offtake agreements with BESS developers.

APS’ 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) highlights battery storage as “an essential element” of its ‘Action Plan’, and “one in which APS is investing heavily”.

The company has a multi-project partnership with subsidiary of Canadian Solar, Recurrent Energy.

APS also issued a request for proposals (RFP), in which it obtained PPAs with Fluence and Invenergy for the 1,900MWh Hashknife solar-plus-storage project.

APS has also signed PPAs with Copia Power for its 2,200MWh Maricopa Energy Centre, which the company claims will be Arizona’s single largest energy transition power generation project.

In 2024, SRP launched an RFP for non-lithium, long-duration energy storage (LDES) demonstration projects, aiming for wider deployment during the early 2030s.

This September, it also announced a partnership with Google to help accelerate the commercialisation of non-lithium LDES technology.

Google will cover part of the expenses for LDES pilot projects on SRP’s grid. Additionally, the technology company will analyse operational data from these pilots and offer feedback on the research and testing strategies.

SRP and APS have contributed to Arizona’s position as a leader in utility-scale BESS installations. Recently, the state has frequently ranked third, following Texas and California, in utility-scale BESS deployments.

At UD, alumna discovered twin passions for agriculture and laboratory research

The First-Generation College Celebration (FGCC) is held annually across the country on Nov. 8 to raise awareness of first-generation students and commemorate the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

Six years after starting college, only 24% of first-generation students nationwide earn a bachelor’s degree, compared to 59% of continuing-generation students, according to FirstGen Forward.

University of Delaware alumna Tiffany Carro is among the 24% of first-generation college graduates. Today, she is the director of global regulatory sciences in the research and development organization for FMC Corporation, an agricultural sciences company with a research and technology center in Newark, Delaware. Carro also sits on the external advisory board of The Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) at UD.

“Underrepresented minority women receive less than 7% of doctorate degrees in STEM in the US,” Carro said, citing a 2023 article from Pew Research Center. “Hispanic/Latina women in STEM represent less than 5% of STEM undergraduate degrees, but they have had the fastest growth in advanced degrees by race and ethnicity.”

Carro is an advocate for underrepresented communities in the STEM field. She volunteers her time to mentor the next generation of scientists.

“I had the advantage of a supportive family when I started college in 2000,” Carro said. “Even still, it would have been unlikely for me to obtain an advanced degree at the time — a woman, first-generation Hispanic college student, and pursuing a STEM major? I benefited from professors and mentors who invested in me at all levels of my education.”

Carro found those mentors at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR), where she earned a bachelor’s degree in animal science and agricultural education in 2004 and a master’s degree in animal science in 2007. She then earned a doctorate in environmental toxicology from the University of Maryland.

Carro wasn’t born into agriculture; she grew up in New York City, about as far from the farm as you can get. Her passion for agriculture grew through involvement with Sigma Alpha, a professional agricultural sorority at UD. She considers the sorority’s advisor, Pat Barber, a retired associate professor and former associate dean of Cooperative Extension, as a mentor.

Another of Carro’s mentors is Lesa (Griffiths) Massarotti, a professor in the Department of Animal and Food Sciences, who taught Carro’s very first class at UD.

“For somebody like me who came in and didn't really understand how the University platform worked, having Lesa as an instructor and a mentor was invaluable,” Carro said. “She empowered me to identify my own career path.”

In the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Carro also developed a passion for laboratory work.

“The opportunity to work in a lab, which I don’t think I would have had at other universities as an undergraduate, really helped me make the decision to move into a master’s program,” Carro said. “I didn’t have people in my immediate circle who understood bachelor’s versus master’s versus doctoral programs, so it was really nice to get that exposure so early on.”

That hands-on experience led Carro to pursue a master’s degree at UD after mentor Bill Saylor, UD professor emeritus, planted the idea in her mind.

“I remember Professor Saylor saying to me, ‘If you’re interested in research, you could go to graduate school,’ which wasn't even on my radar until he encouraged it,” Carro said.

During her graduate studies, Carro worked with scientists at DuPont, under Saylor’s guidance. The work informed her graduate thesis.

Carro developed an interest in environmental toxicology, the study of how toxins impact organisms in the environment. She worked for the U.S. Government, completing avian risk assessments at a Superfund site, a location contaminated with hazardous materials and requiring a long-term response.

“Those projects taught me, really fast, how important it is to collaborate in science,” Carro said. “There's not much that can be achieved without working across disciplines.”

Collaboration is key to Carro’s role as director of global regulatory sciences at FMC Corporation. FMC provides internships to Blue Hens, employs many UD alumni and supports University of Delaware Ag Day. At FMC, Carro oversees a team of 50 scientists, including experts in computational modeling, metabolism and residue chemistry, environmental fate chemistry, toxicology and other fields.

“The purpose of the team is to support FMC’s portfolio of plant protection products across both our synthetic chemistry and our plant health platforms to enable authorities like the Environmental Protection Agency to support decisions of safety to humans and safety to the environment,” she said. “That allows us to obtain registrations for our products.”

Her team’s research supports the FMC portfolio, including products registered in nearly 140 countries.

Carro values an interdisciplinary approach to solutions. She says having a growth mindset and being willing to collaborate are keys to success.

“When I was an ecotoxicologist, I couldn’t complete my responsibilities without understanding what’s happening in the environment, in exposure simulations and across risk assessment,” Carro said. “Everything we do as scientists is interdisciplinary.”

Carro sees her work aligning with the CANR mission to feed the world and protect the planet. She points out that although the human population is growing, farmland is a finite resource.

“To manage that, we need industries like the one I'm in to be creative and sustainable, and to be good stewards,” Carro said. “That’s what I find rewarding about the role that I’m in now.”

Carro feels lucky to have had great mentors and wants to offer those same opportunities to women and underrepresented communities in STEM. She participates in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, through FMC’s outreach efforts, volunteers at career day events and mentorship programs.

The STEM fields have a profound impact on every aspect of our lives, and increasing diversity in STEM can lead to further scientific innovation. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that diverse teams lead to more effective problem-solving. Perhaps the first step in building those diverse teams, Carro said, is to support the success of first-generation college students, 50% of whom are students of color.",https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/udaily/2025/november/Tiffany-Carro-Primary-800x420.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:13.126028

Built-in Rapid Shutdown capabilities ensure automatic system shutdown in emergencies, while a NEMA 6 rating allows for reliable performance in harsh weather conditions. These features, combined with advanced cybersecurity protections, make IQ8 Microinverters a trusted choice for powering fuel retail sites safely and efficiently.

Several gas stations installations have been completed in the United States, including one from solar installer DynamicSLR, which installed a 49 kW solar system at the Tri Gaz 5 gas station in Crandall, Texas. The project is expected to offset 17% of the site’s electricity demand and generate an estimated lifetime savings of more than $150,000. Dozens of gas stations across Puerto Rico have Enphase products deployed through independent installers, including Green Energy & Fuels, Edison Energy, Pura Energia, and Solar Roots, further demonstrating the reliability and scalability of Enphase microinverters in demanding commercial environments.

In Southeast Asia, Enphase microinverters are powering hundreds of gas stations. Super Central Gas has installed Enphase systems across 105 Shell stations, while multiple installers – Super Central Gas, TNS Network Solution, and MRO Engineering – have equipped PTT franchise sites. PTT stations typically range from 30 kW to over 100 kW, with at least 37 locations confirmed that feature Enphase systems. In the Philippines, solar installer MSpectrum has deployed Enphase systems at several Petron stations, and Solaren has completed seven additional gas-station projects, each averaging 15 kW.

In Colombia, Gimecol Solar recently delivered a 50 kW system at the EDS Moya gas station using Enphase IQ8 Microinverters, showcasing the technology’s reliability and ease of deployment in Latin America.

""With the Tri Gaz 5 project, we needed a high-performing solution that could operate reliably in the intense Texas heat,"" said Ahmad Dweik, managing partner at DynamicSLR, an installer of Enphase products in the United States. ""Enphase microinverters have a NEMA 6 rating and zero potential for DC arc-fault fires, for safe operations in even extreme conditions.”

“Our project, the EDS Moya in Colombia, demonstrates how simple and safe Enphase technology is to deploy,” said Julio Darío Fuentes Polanco, co-founder of Gimecol Solar, an installer of Enphase products in Columbia. “The microinverters provide the performance and reliability our customers demand.”

“Our relationship with Enphase is helping fuel retailers like Shell and PTT reduce energy costs and lower their carbon footprint,” said Apisit Tanadumrongsak, CEO of SCG Future Energy Co., Ltd., an installer of Enphase products in Thailand. “The safety advantages of AC-based systems make Enphase a natural choice for these environments.”

“Installing solar at gas stations requires technology that installers can trust to perform in complex, safety-critical environments,” said Aaron Gordon, senior vice president and general manager of the systems business unit at Enphase Energy. “Our IQ8 Microinverters give them that confidence – combining safety, reliability, and flexibility in one system. It’s why customers around the world continue to choose Enphase to help fuel retailers cut energy costs, lower emissions, and accelerate their clean energy transition.”

Most of Enphase’s IQ8 Microinverters are produced at U.S. manufacturing facilities, which can help commercial projects in the United States qualify for valuable domestic content bonus tax credits. Enphase also recently announced that pre-orders are open for its IQ9N-3P™ Commercial Microinverters in the United States, with shipments expected to begin in December 2025. The IQ9N-3P is Enphase’s first microinverter powered by advanced gallium nitride (GaN) technology and designed specifically for three-phase 480Y/277 V (wye) grid configurations – without the need for external transformers.

As the nation anticipates surging electricity demand and corresponding high rates, DE offers a rapid-deployment advantage over traditional grid-scale power plants. This session dives deep into how technologies like bidirectional EV charging, Virtual Power Plant (VPP) orchestration, and demand response are meeting complex grid challenges and offering households and businesses true energy independence.

Policy and the post-tax credit landscape

The morning kicks off with a crucial keynote from Nick Montoni, Senior Program Director at the NC Clean Technology Center. Drawing on his extensive background with the Department of Energy and the U.S. House of Representatives, Montoni will illuminate the evolution of state solar policy and the monumental hurdles facing the Solar for All program. The discussion will address the impact of the EPA’s termination and subsequent litigation over the $7 billion program and the challenges in translating large-scale federal legislation (like the IRA) into rapid, effective deployment at the state and local levels.

Montoni will also provide actionable insights from the “50 States of Solar” reports, focusing on:

The Interconnection Bottleneck: Identifying the most severe drag on distributed project timelines and the most promising state-level innovations to solve it.

Beyond Net Metering (NEM): Analyzing the mass migration away from traditional NEM and defining the characteristics of a successful successor tariff that balances project economics with utility compensation for grid services.

Technology and the fully integrated solution

The session then pivots to the role of technology and integrated solutions in lowering costs and enhancing grid stability. Danielle Merfeld, Global Chief Technology Officer at Qcells, will detail how the company’s full vertical integration in the U.S.—from ingots to modules—not only secures supply but also standardizes products to lower “soft costs” and reduce administrative “red tape” for installers. Merfeld will also discuss the future of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), explaining how Qcells’ Geli software uses AI and real-time data to make battery systems reliable grid assets.

Following this, Rob Adams, COO of Solaflect Energy, will present his company’s pioneering off-grid solar and EV charging solution, the Apollo. The presentation will explore the substantial value proposition of entirely bypassing the traditional utility grid upgrade process—a major hurdle for commercial clients and fleets—to enable faster EV adoption and provide a competitive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

The path to widespread adoption

The highlight of the day is a powerhouse panel featuring advocates, analysts, and installers: Brad Heavner (CALSSA), Caitlin Connelly (Wood Mackenzie), Emily Walker (EnergySage), and Fortunat Mueller (ReVision Energy).

Key issues the panel will dissect include:

The Residential Market Crunch: Analyzing the policy and market conditions behind recent installer bankruptcies and the impact of the expiring residential tax credit (25D) on customer-owned systems.

The VPP Promise: Discussion on the benefits and legislative status of Virtual Power Plants in leading markets like California, and the critical missing pieces needed to make aggregated customer batteries truly effective for grid services.

Soft Cost Conundrum: Exploring non-hardware strategies—from SolarAPP+ adoption to financing innovation—to achieve significant cost reductions in the distributed sector.

Electrification Synergy: The opportunity for installers to bundle solar and storage with heat pumps and EV chargers to deliver a fully integrated, cost-effective home energy solution.

This final session offers a comprehensive outlook on how policy reform, technological integration, and market education will overcome constraints to establish distributed energy as the lynchpin of the future U.S. grid.

Rolls-Royce Replaces The EV Tax Credit

The $5,000 EV Lease Credit for the Spectre EV is available on 2025 and 2026 model years. It’s only available on leases and, like the automaker’s other programs, it ends on November 30. Based on our analysis, the lease cash offer used to be $7,500. After September 30, Rolls-Royce reduced it to $5,000.

The underlying money factor for the Spectre, though, isn’t great at 0.00190 on 2025 model year trims. That’s equivalent to 4.6% APR financing.

Does Maserati Have Better Discounts?

Rolls-Royce isn’t the only luxury brand that introduced discounts on its electric vehicles. Earlier this October, Maserati was offering select models with up to $50,000 in incentives. The Italian brand’s GranTurismo Folgore and GranCabrio Folgore were being offered with $25,000 discounts when leased or purchased, which could be stacked with 5.49% APR financing for 72 months. These discounts heavily outweighed those that were available for gas-powered vehicles.

Why Are Automakers Introducing EV Lease Deals?

The current administration got rid of the federal EV tax credit for shoppers looking to purchase and lease a model at the end of September. The decision essentially made electric cars $7,500 more expensive. Since the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit, automakers have introduced price cuts, lease deals, and special financing rates to persuade shoppers to purchase an EV. In Rolls-Royce’s case, the Spectre wasn’t available for the federal EV tax credit when purchased, but was available with the $7,500 federal tax credit when leased.

AUSTIN, Texas, November 06, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ørsted has selected Habitat Energy to provide optimization and Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) services for its 250 MW, 2-hour battery energy storage system in Fort Bend County, Texas. Once completed, the project will be among the largest standalone batteries operating in ERCOT.

The partnership is structured across two deals: Habitat will contract QSE services to Ørsted’s Asset Management division and optimization & trading services to their Trading division, aligning incentives across both functions. This dual arrangement reflects the increasing importance of integrated energy management for battery energy storage systems in ERCOT, especially hedging strategies that safeguard returns in volatile markets and readiness to thrive under upcoming real-time co-optimization changes.

""This is our largest battery to date, and it’s exactly the kind of project our platform was built for,"" said Mike Kirschner, U.S. Managing Director of Habitat Energy. ""Ørsted is a global and US energy leader with world-class capabilities of its own. Working with Ørsted on this project highlights both its scale and the need for a platform designed to manage large, complex assets in ERCOT’s high-stakes market.""

The battery’s size brings unique operational and market considerations. Every charge and discharge has the potential to move prices, affect congestion, or shift dynamics within the local market. With a co-located solar project also connected to the same interconnection point, Habitat will manage the added complexity of separating solar production from battery metering, ensuring accurate forecasting, dispatch decisions, and revenue capture.

""Large-scale storage is becoming essential to balancing the grid and unlocking further development of American energy,"" said Robert Gomez, Head of Asset Management at Ørsted. ""Habitat’s platform and expertise give us the tools to maximize the value of this key project while managing our market impact.""

With over 1.5 GW of storage under management in ERCOT, Habitat’s growing portfolio reflects the trust that developers and investors are placing in third-party optimization. By combining algorithmic bidding, forecasting, QSE representation, and hedging support, Habitat helps asset owners capture full value from their investments while derisking performance.

The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.
The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing.
DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.","After months of work and political wrangling over potential legal impact, a new, small network of air sensors began collecting real-time data in four Mississippi River communities and has already detected spikes in pollution since going live in September, an environmental group says.

For years, community and environmental advocates have argued that the state should require real-time, fence-line air monitoring around the state's major industrial facilities to supplement its regional network with more localized data. But the idea has faced resistance from industry, regulators and legislators over the cost, the fear of false positives and of providing fuel for lawsuits.

Located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, new AQMesh sensors sponsored by environmental group LEAN represent a different tack, putting monitors in the community and offering, the nonprofit's officials believe, the potential to spur voluntary air quality improvements even if the sensors' data don't have regulatory teeth.

""It is our hope that by shining a light on contaminants in the air, we can show companies where their operations are having potentially adverse impacts on neighboring citizens, as well as on company workers, and can spur constructive discussions of ways to reduce emissions and lessen the health impacts,"" Marylee Orr, LEAN's executive director, said in a statement.

The AQMesh sensors can't carry the force of law because they don't meet a new state equipment standard, LEAN officials acknowledge, but they insist the accuracy is close to regulatory-level equipment.

Financed with part of a $500,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant, the four LEAN air sensors are located in Alsen, Geismar, St. James and Donaldsonville. The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.

Running since the beginning of the year, the four sensors were first calibrated for months standing next to Louisiana regulatory air monitors and were found to meet EPA thresholds for data comparability with the state equipment, LEAN's scientific advisors say.

The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also collect data on wind speed and direction, with the information published on LEAN's website every 15 minutes.

These pollutants are regulated by the state and federal government, have known health impacts and are common near industrial sources, but, in many cases, can come from many other sources as well.

Slawomir Lomnicki, an LSU environmental science professor who is advising LEAN, explained that the data so far are providing clear trends, including spikes in Geismar for volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that can be tied to toxic industrial pollution.

""When we look at the correlation between atmospherical conditions and these pollutants, in many cases, you can see a very clear correlation with the direction from where the plume is coming,"" he said.

'This is historic'

LEAN officials say they have been meeting with community members to discuss the data and then will facilitate meetings between residents and area companies ""to explore ways to correct and prevent emissions incidents.""

The arrival of the sensors has sparked a mix of praise and criticism from community groups, as well as caution from industry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing. And now, we—the people—can be part of the solution,"" Pastor Harry Joseph, LEAN’s local community shepherd, who oversees the air quality sensor in St. James Parish, said in a LEAN statement.

DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.

The Louisiana Chemical Association, a key trade group for river industries and outspoken critic of the cost and feasibility of public fence-line monitors, said it wants to review the findings ""to better understand"" them, ""confirm their methods and quality controls, and interpret how the results compare with reported emissions data from state and federal authorities.""

""Ambient measurements can reflect background levels and non-industrial contributors, including traffic and other businesses, so we want to ensure these are properly taken into account,"" said David Cresson, president and CEO of LCA and its sister organization, the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance.

""We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue.""

Other community groups have criticized the sensors as technologically insufficient, though those criticisms have come in the context of a parallel LEAN project still under development in St. Rose.

Four more AQMesh sensors are in place and being calibrated for future reporting in the St. Charles Parish community, where chronic smells and emissions have fueled concern over a large tank farm owned by International Matex Tank Terminals.

Those sensors come after DEQ removed one of its own community monitors a few years ago that both residents and IMTT had wanted to remain.

Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors. The data will be collected by a third party and published in real time on LEAN's website, like the current data.

Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who leads the St. Rose community group Refined Community Empowerment, said she didn't trust LEAN's early hotspot findings and argued the LEAN sensors won't provide specific enough information about what kinds of toxic chemicals are in the air.

Traci Johnson, IMTT's vice president for environment, health, safety and security, said the company followed LEAN's recommendations on which chemicals the sensors should test for.

'What's going on here?'

In 2024, as environmental groups began proposing their own community-based systems and conducting other efforts like mobile air monitoring, the Legislature pushed through new rules that barred data from these systems from being used for regulatory actions or lawsuits if they didn't match federal standards for regulatory air monitoring equipment.

That law is the subject of a 1st Amendment lawsuit brought in federal court by environmental groups, though not LEAN.

Larry Starfield, a retired top EPA official and lawyer who also advised LEAN, said that while the sensors are not the same as regulatory air monitors, they have seen great improvement in accuracy over the past decade and come at significantly lower cost than regulatory equipment.

Starfield, who spent his last 12 years at EPA as the principal deputy assistant administrator for enforcement before his retirement in 2023, said that LEAN's advance calibration work has shown the results ""are highly consistent with readings that would be expected using LDEQ’s regulatory monitor.""

But he added that LEAN's intended application will fit a role that EPA says is acceptable for sensors and won't violate the new state law, highlighting instead elevated emissions in the hopes of voluntary corrections, not to allege violations of law.

""Where you have people living so close to industry, having a local, real-time, every-15-minute look at what's going on in your neighborhood in terms of air quality is just unique, and so it just gives them a chance to raise a flag and say, 'Hey, what's going on here?'"" he said.

Starfield pointed out that the earlier phase of the LEAN project that used the air monitoring car found elevated emissions and a company quickly corrected the problem after it was informed. He called it a ""different way of doing business"" than more traditional, slower methods through enforcement or litigation.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/shreveportbossieradvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/59/959f5559-f07f-59ab-a3b3-13257a4019ae/690be18eba8a9.image.jpg?crop=977%2C513%2C0%2C803,N,,2025-11-06 10:20:16.591693

AFPM highlighted the following in its comments:

EPA’s June RFS proposal is already poised to be the most expensive in history. Reallocation will make it worse, potentially pushing total 2026-2027 compliance costs to nearly $150 billion: “…analysts already ‘expect the RVO compliance per barrel of gasoline or diesel to go from $5.42/bbl through the first five months of 2025 to $10.24 in 2026,” meaning that they will nearly double in less than two years. EPA must not exacerbate these high costs with additional volumes… Turner Mason & Company (TM&C) estimates that full (100%) reallocation alone could increase compliance costs by $10–12 billion [pushing total compliance costs to nearly $150 billion].”

Reallocation would raise the RFS well beyond the volume that domestic supplies of soybean oil could support (based on 2026-2027 crushing capacity). It will raise biofuel feedstock costs and make the United States more dependent on imports: “…additional renewable fuel production will be required to achieve the additional volume requirements proposed [by EPA], increasing RIN demand, putting upward pressure on feedstock and RIN prices, and increasing overall RFS program costs… new analysis by S&P Global Commodity Insight confirms that feedstock shortages will increase soybean oil prices, forcing higher imports, and further undermining U.S. energy security — the very outcome the RFS was intended to prevent.”

If EPA’s reallocation mandate helps to drive soybean oil costs significantly higher, total RFS costs—which are paid by American consumers and refiners—could rise from $150 billion to $190 billion over 2026 and 2027: “As a result of forecasted higher feedstock prices, the price difference between bean oil (BO) or more specifically soybean oil — the primary feedstock for biodiesel production—and heating oil (HO) or ultra-low sulfur diesel (referred to as the BOHO spread) is expected to widen. If the spread widens to historical highs, TM&C projects the proposal could increase compliance costs from $136 billion [total costs of EPA’s June RFS proposal] to as much as $190 billion — an increase of $54 billion or 40%. Furthermore, EPA failed to evaluate the impact of this proposal on food prices, which may require shifting the use of soybean oil from current uses, such as food or animal feed, to biofuel production.”

The only lawful, acceptable reallocation number is zero: “EPA must withdraw the SNPRM and instead implement a 0% reallocation policy. Only by setting volumes grounded in real, forward-looking production data and completing a comprehensive statutory impact analysis can EPA maintain compliance with both the Clean Air Act and principles of regulatory accountability.”

The updated strategy targets every stage of the company's value chain, from agriculture and manufacturing to packaging and energy sourcing.

With a workforce of 18,000+ and a portfolio that includes more than 200 brands such as Absolut vodka, Jameson Irish whiskey, Beefeater gin and Malibu liqueur, the group distributes its products in more than 160 countries. The focus now is on making its entire production model more resilient and sustainable, rooted in what Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard describes as a generational commitment.

Alexandre says: ""Good Times from a Good Place is our strategy to ensure that we operate in a way that minimises our impact on the environment, supports people throughout our value chain and fosters a culture of convivial drinking.""

Protecting terroir with regenerative agriculture

Pernod Ricard places emphasis on protecting terroir – the natural environment in which its ingredients grow, particularly relevant in viticulture and spirit production. This focus translates into concrete steps to adapt to climate change and enhance biodiversity.

The company is introducing regenerative agriculture, referring to farming practices that aim to restore soil health, capture carbon and improve the ecosystem, across its growing regions. Through this approach, Pernod Ricard aims to reduce agricultural emissions and preserve biodiversity in its supply chain by 2030.

The move includes replacing synthetic fertilisers with greener alternatives, switching to renewable energy for agricultural equipment and introducing cover crops such as clover, herbs and grasses between harvest cycles. These crops help retain soil nutrients, reduce erosion and support pollinators and other biodiversity.

Expert consultation also plays a role, as the business partners with specialists to protect and restore habitats, ensuring long-term resilience in both its ecosystems and harvests.

Alexandre acknowledges the scale of challenges: “Today, the world at large faces a growing number of existential challenges. From the escalating impact of climate change to increasing social and political uncertainty, we remain firm in the belief that operating responsibly and sustainably is fundamental to ensure our business remains resilient in the future.”

Packaging strategy builds circularity

Elsewhere, Pernod Ricard has identified packaging as a critical area to tackle in its carbon footprint, with packaging currently responsible for 26% of its total emissions. The company uses this data to inform material and design changes that fit within a broader circular economy model.

Circularity, in this context, refers to the reuse, recycling and reduction of materials throughout a product’s lifecycle. To address this, the company is increasing the use of post-consumer recycled materials, light-weighting bottles and altering glass colours to reduce emissions during manufacturing.

The business is also moving away from plastic, switching to plastic-free caps and using bottles made with 95% recycled glass. These adjustments not only lower emissions but simplify recycling for end-users.

Energy efficiency upgrades contribute to these goals. For example, Pernod Ricard reports that its Absolut vodka distillery now operates without fossil fuels. Elsewhere, distilleries in Ireland and Scotland have introduced heat recovery technology to reduce both water and energy consumption.

In a broader energy context, 2024 marked the point at which the group reached 100% renewable electricity for all global offices and production sites – achieved through a combination of green energy purchasing and Renewable Energy Certificates, which verify the use of clean power sources.

Prioritising efficiency and responsibility

Maria Pia De Caro, Executive Vice President of Integrated Operations and Sustainability and Responsibility (S&R), explains how sustainability now shapes all aspects of Pernod Ricard's business operations, from sourcing raw materials to distribution.

She says: “Sustainability and responsibility is fully embedded in how we operate, shaping the way we produce and serve our brands while caring for people and the planet. From grain to glass, our value chain reflects a deep commitment to doing business the right way by embedding efficiency and innovation.”

That grain-to-glass model links every production step, ensuring environmental considerations are not treated as standalone initiatives but as embedded parts of every decision. This includes reducing emissions not just at the point of production but across Scope 1, 2 and 3 categories – covering direct emissions, indirect emissions from energy, and all other emissions linked to its supply chain.

With Canada facing a slew of challenges, the Carney government promised a budget that would “swing for the fences” — one that would make generational investments to build, protect and empower Canada.

To do so, the budget outlines an industrial strategy focused largely on infrastructure and boosting business productivity and competitiveness. It hits a lot of the right notes with investments in trade infrastructure, critical minerals and tax incentives for business investment. It also strives to use federal fiscal power to catalyze investment from different sources, with the aim of maximizing the economic impact of each public dollar.

However, with few measures directly aimed at households, the budget appears to sideline affordability — a pressing issue for many Canadians. The government may be betting that Canadians see the wisdom in securing the economic foundations that support Canada’s social programs. As Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew often says, the economic horse pulls the social cart.

The Carney government may be on the right track, but whether the budget delivers remains to be seen. Success requires the public service to excel at program execution, while its employees, funding and access to outside consultants face cuts. This will be a serious test for the public service.

The first industrial strategy in decades

Budget 2025 uses a long list of adjectives, such as accelerating, boosting, strengthening, mobilising, catalysing (with British spelling) and supercharging, to describe a package of measures that arguably amounts to the first comprehensive industrial strategy Canada has seen since the mid-20th century. The goal is to use federal spending and taxation power to drive investments from the private sector and other levels of government to help offset the economic costs of tariffs and the uncertainty they bring.

The budget doubles public capital investments over five years to enable more than $1 trillion in total investment — including in major projects, housing and infrastructure. A suite of tax incentives will also provide Canadian businesses with the lowest marginal effective tax rate in the G7.

Particularly promising investments include:

Spending $5 billion over seven years in a “trade diversification corridors fund” for rail, ports and other infrastructure to improve access to non-U.S. markets.

Dedicating $2 billion over five years for a “critical minerals sovereign fund” to invest in projects and companies.

Creating a “productivity super-deduction” that includes tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in productivity-enhancing assets and technologies.

A proliferation of strategies: Some impressive, some less so

As part of the industrial strategy, the budget includes a climate competitiveness strategy, a defence industrial strategy and a trade diversification strategy. It also promises an artificial intelligence strategy by the end of 2025.

The climate competitiveness strategy is underwhelming. It vows to engage provinces and territories on a post-2030 industrial carbon pricing trajectory and the benchmark that harmonizes plans across regions. The strategy also promises to update and finalize regulations for methane emissions, electric vehicles and clean fuels, and adjust tax credits.

It hints at axing the oil and gas emissions cap, noting that technologies such as carbon capture and storage would remove the need for it. Expanded critical mineral measures are also rolled into climate competitiveness, given their use in electric vehicles and clean energy.

The defence industrial strategy is more concrete. It commits $6 billion over five years for the creation of the Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science (BOREALIS), support for small and medium-sized enterprises to contribute to defence and security capabilities, and funding to develop and commercialize dual civilian-military technologies. This commitment includes funding for quantum technology development and adoption, partnerships with allies to secure critical mineral supplies, and development of sovereign space launch capability.

The trade diversification strategy is also relatively specific. It earmarks $5 billion over seven years for trade infrastructure, $1 billion over four years for dual-use transportation projects in the north, and enhanced capacity for Export Development Canada to increase the total business they facilitate by $25 billion by 2030.

However, two of the most interesting announcements come with little funding. The first is a new Strategic Exports Office to co-ordinate trade diversification engagement across all departments. The second is tapping the Major Projects Office to act as a single window for proponents and steer a unified and co-ordinated financing approach that prioritizes nation-building projects. Both initiatives propose better co-ordination, which could be powerful if it gets all departmental and Crown agency efforts working in lockstep to achieve the government’s goals.

Execution challenges

Whether the budget delivers will depend on a public service that is expected to do more with less.

The budget commits to reducing the public service workforce by 40,000 below its 2023-24 peak over three years, which amounts to a 10 per cent cut. Early retirement incentives may alleviate some of the pain but could result in a significant loss of knowledge and experience. The public service must also spend 20 per cent less on external consultants, which will limit the option of outside help.

Fiscal rules and the return of discipline to Canada’s finances

Canada’s economic success is at risk from weak climate adaptation

IRPP research shows that industrial policies succeed or fail based on the clarity of the strategy, strength of governance and rigour of program evaluation. To deliver the Carney government’s industrial strategy, policy excellence is a must — something that depends on a public service with strong leadership, significant expertise and effective processes. This may be a tall order for institutions that must cut programs and staff.

Great expectations come with risks

By using lofty language to describe the budget, the government has raised expectations. Canadians may come to feel it overpromised and underdelivered.

It will take time for investments to show results, no matter how fast the government moves. As such, the government must find a way to demonstrate tangible benefits on a shorter timeline to keep Canadians on board. Otherwise, its efforts may amount to a swing and a miss.",https://policyoptions.irpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CP175197393-Carney-budget.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 11:07:59.248693

Tesla is expected to announce on Thursday the results of a shareholder vote determining whether CEO Elon Musk should receive a pay package of nearly $1 trillion worth of stock over the next decade.

There's little mystery to the outcome.

The electric vehicle company has suggested that shareholders approve the plan. Between Musk's substantial ownership and a hefty base of retail investors who almost always vote with the CEO, the numbers are difficult for the opposition, even though top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against the package.

Results of the vote are expected to be shared after Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas.

Board Chair Robyn Denholm, and other Musk fans, have argued that the outsized pay plan would keep Musk at the helm of the company, and that he's critical to Tesla's future and its ability to compete in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Baron Capital's Ron Baron said in a lengthy post on X, Musk's social network, that he's supporting the Tesla CEO.

""Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk,"" Baron wrote. ""Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.""

But there are some vocal opponents. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said it would vote no. Norges is one of Tesla's top shareholders.

""While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation,"" NBIM said in a statement this week.

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

""Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,"" McRitchie said. ""There's a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.""

Tesla shares are up 14% this year after a steep third-quarter rally lifted the stock into the green following a brutal start to 2025. Musk's purchase of $1 billion worth of stock aided the rebound.

'Robot army'

Tesla introduced the new pay plan in September. The package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024.

""If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?"" Musk said to analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call last month. ""I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.""

The full award would give Musk, who holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

Musk would receive the first tranche of stock if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion.

The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.

Other goals tied to the pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD subscriptions​, 1 million bots delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.

The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as ""FSD Supervised"" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.

Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.

As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.

There are also a list of ""covered events"" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.

Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to ""international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,"" that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.

There are other benefits to Musk.

The pay plan doesn't require him to dedicate a minimum amount of time to Tesla, nor does it at all limit his involvement in politics.

In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.

He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's ""polarizing and partisan actions.""

Shareholders are voting on the plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.

Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and chair of ValueEdge Advisors, said she would vote against the new pay plan for Musk, describing him as a ""part-time CEO"" today.

""If they said we're going to pay him a trillion dollars, but he's going to give up all of his outside activities, he's going to shut up about politics, and really spend all this time making this a great company, then I'd say, OK, let's talk about it,"" Minow said. ""But he's not doing any of those things.""

The invite-only reception, after all, was sponsored by the NYSE Texas stock exchange, which in August had leased 28,000 square feet at Crow’s swank Old Parkland office campus in Dallas’ Oak Lawn neighborhood.

Like Old Parkland, Crow’s library at his Highland Park home is all historic memorabilia and refined opulence, with bookshelves rising two stories, a coffered ceiling, inlaid wooden floors, oversized globes, and rare documents and manuscripts. Access to the library is gained through an equally impressive art gallery—for starters, it’s got an original Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington on display.

That’s where scores of Venture Dallas investors, founders, and key stakeholders found themselves early on the evening of Oct. 29, chatting away as they sampled hors d’oeuvres and a variety of specialty cocktails. Among them were JPMorgan Chase’s Elaine Agather, serial entrepreneur Rogers Healy, state Sen. Tan Parker (R-Flower Mound), Hubert Zajicek of Health Wildcatters, David Copps of Worlds, and Javier David, the new business editor at The Dallas Morning News. In time, the guests were asked to step into the library to listen to a conversation between Perot Jain partner Aaron Pierce—he’s the Venture Dallas co-founder and chair—and NYSE Texas president Bryan Daniel.

Their talk, and the conference that would follow, came at an opportune time for innovators and investors in North Texas. The region continues to boast strong population growth, a well-educated talent pool, government and infrastructure support, and more and more corporate relocations and expansions. The latter have been especially notable in the technology and financial sectors, with a recent proliferation of data-center developments and the advent of Y’all Street, underscored by the birth of the Texas Stock Exchange and the arrival of NYSE Texas and a new regional headquarters for Nasdaq.

Since beginning operations in March, NYSE’s Daniel told the elite crowd in the Crow library, “Nicey Texas,” as it’s come to be called, already has secured 94 dual listings. “This is just a great place to do business,” he enthused. “We came to Texas really to capitalize on the energy, the momentum, all the great things that we’re seeing in the state.”

‘People want to help each other’

Fourteen hours later, it was Pierce who welcomed attendees to the day-long Venture summit, held at the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University. Pierce noted that the event has grown “bigger and bigger and bigger” since its inaugural conference in 2019. “Those of us that live here know how great this place is, but for those of you that don’t spend as much time here, I hope that you leave inspired and will say, ‘Man, Dallas is a place where I should be spending more time—maybe I’ll move my family there, or maybe I’ll start a business there,’” Pierce told the crowd.

After still more welcoming remarks by new SMU president Jay Hartzell—he said the university is eager to be the “best possible partner” for Dallas founders, investors, and corporate leaders—Pierce and Agather sat down to talk about JPMorgan’s growth in Texas.

Agather, who leads the bank’s Dallas region, said JPMorgan has grown from 4,000 employees to 33,000 in the Lone Star State, making Texas larger than the bank’s New York market. She explained the substantial growth by citing factors including the state’s geographic location, regulatory stances, diversified economy—and collaborative spirit.

“I think when people move down here at first, they kind of think it’s fake,” she said. “And then they’re like, ‘This is real—people want to help each other,’ and that does raise the bar for everybody.”

Agather also noted JPMorgan’s recently announced Security and Resiliency Initiative, which commits the bank to invest $1.5 trillion over 10 years in supply chains and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence, and strategic technologies like AI and cybersecurity.

Investments of a different sort were outlined next by Bobby Franklin, president and CEO of NCVA—the National Venture Capital Association. Citing NCVA studies, Franklin said venture-capital deals and dollars have ticked up recently, while exit activity remains below 2021’s peak liquidity levels and fundraising is tepid, despite the availability of “lots of dry powder.” But Texas investment, Franklin said, “is looking fantastic,” outstripping most states and outperforming the entire Southwest region so far this year.

The VC industry had “lots of wins” in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, added Franklin. He stressed the need for a single federal standard for AI regulation—rather than different sets of rules in each state—“so that AI can reach its full potential.” He also said the NCVA enjoys a good relationship with new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins, who “is serious about making IPOs great again.”

A cutting-edge trading engine for TXSE

The importance of IPOs was also referenced during a discussion of the new Texas Stock Exchange by Ylan Mui of the Penta Group, a research and consulting firm, and Jeb Hensarling, a former Dallas GOP congressman who’s now a strategic advisor to TXSE (or Tex-ee, as they’re calling it now).

With SEC approval of the Dallas-based exchange having been secured in September, Hensarling told Venture Dallas attendees to look for TXSE to announce its physical headquarters location by year’s end. The first quarter of 2026 will see training on its state-of-the-art “trading engine,” he said, and then listings of ETPs (exchange-traded products) “probably in the second quarter of next year, with listings in corporates to follow.”

TXSE’s cutting-edge trading engine—as well as its newly announced, AI-native Oculon data-analytics and compliance software platform—will give the new exchange a leg up over the NYSE and Nasdaq duopoly, Hensarling said. “I think not only will Tex-ee be great for Texas … but I also think it’s going to be great for capital markets and for those companies who choose to have the ability to have world-class trading and listing at a more competitive price, with policies that are known and stable,” he said.

Panelists at another session called Furthering the Texas Miracle agreed with Hensarling, who’d predicted that in 15 years, Texas will be “the center for capital markets in America.” Ross Perot Jr., chairman of The Perot Companies and Hillwood, cited the business-friendly groundwork laid by the state’s leaders stretching back three decades, from the development of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the Alliance Texas project to reforms in the legal and education fields.

“You’ve got incredible growth coming, and it’s the airports, it’s infrastructure, but what it really is, is attitude,” Perot said. “It’s a very optimistic attitude and a can-do spirit: We’re going to get it done!”

Drew McKnight, co-CEO and managing partner at Dallas-based Fortress, a global investment group, echoed Perot’s sentiments, highlighting the proactive role of educational institutions like SMU in encouraging entrepreneurship. He also cited the region’s “civic-mindedness”—in sharp contrast to California, where McKnight had worked before relocating to North Texas.

“I wasn’t nearly this civic-minded in California, mainly because they wouldn’t return my phone calls, because they didn’t care,” McKnight said. “And here, whether it’s the mayor or the governor or any one of state representatives, they want to hear from you and they want ideas. That’s encouraging, because when you have an idea and someone actually listens to you, it encourages you to come up with more.”

Robots called ‘the space race of our time’

The idea explored in the next session—a conversation between Apptronik CEO Jeff Cardenas and investor Chris Camillo of Dumb Money—was the future of humanoid robots. Cardenas said Apptronik, a 10-year-old, AI-powered robotics company that has a strategic partnership with Google DeepMind, is reimagining a next generation of general-purpose robots that will change the way people live and work. He likened creation of the company’s latest-iteration robot to a “personal computer moment,” when robots are able to collaborate with humans to accomplish multiple tasks on a mass scale.

Camillo pointed out that China is ahead of the United States in robotic investment and adoption for industrial manufacturing, and Cardenas agreed. “I’ve sort of called this the space race of our time,” said Cardenas, who’s been urging Washington to develop a national robotic strategy. “I think whoever wins it is going to define the future for us.”

He predicted there will be significant progress in making humanoid robots available for the U.S. industrial market at scale by 2027, with adoption for home uses coming a few years afterward. “I would say very confidently that, 10 years from now, it’s very likely that many of you guys have a robot in your home,” Cardenas told the attendees.

Perot Jain managing partner Anurag Jain, whose 14-year-old Access Healthcare was folded in May into a new company in a $6 billion deal by private equity firm New Mountain Capital, said he agreed that “robots are important.” But in a conversation with retired EY partner Debra von Storch, Jain said there should be limits: “I think the creativity of the human mind is something that I don’t want to ever take away.”

Dallas-based Access, the fourth company in Jain’s entrepreneurial journey, had become a leading player in revenue cycle management for the healthcare industry. But Jain told von Storch that the deal with New Mountain made sense because of New Mountain’s ability to keep pace with rapid change in that industry, much of it powered by artificial intelligence. Jain’s next company, he said, also will be a business process outsourcing provider—a “mostly AI native” company in the real estate industry, with far fewer workers than Access’ 27,000 or so.

Asked what “critical lessons” he’d learned during his career that might be helpful to entrepreneurs, Jain said the first is: Don’t sell yourself short. “I think we sold ourselves short many times. Number two is: Your people are the most important thing. … At this point in time, staying private is an equally good opportunity [as an IPO], depending on the company, where you are, and the capital you need,” he continued. “I think private equity is a fantastic option if you find the right partner.”

Seeking innovators and investors who are brave

Participants in another panel called Driving Growth Through Dallas Venture Capital indicated that, for too many DFW founders, securing any kind of equity is problematic. Despite the proliferation of wealthy investors in North Texas, the panelists said, startups that often are forced to fundraise elsewhere end up relocating permanently to other cities, depriving the region of entrepreneurial vitality. The culprit, the panelists agreed, is the “standardized playbooks” of traditional Dallas industries like energy and real estate, which conflict with venture’s bent toward creativity and contrarian thinking.

What’s needed, they said, is a stronger bench of local CEOs and business owners as well as a cadre of so-called bravery hunters—that is, a new generation of transformative founders courageous enough to tackle truly hard problems while taking real risks. “It’s that risk calibration. Are we getting the most novel technology companies on the planet, or certainly at least in the United States, into the DFW area?” asked John Redgrave, co-founder and general partner of Dallas-based DTX Ventures. “We’ve got to be bravery hunters. We hunt for people who are brave, and we ourselves need to be brave. That means writing checks to early-stage companies who are going to go and change some ecosystem.”

Another panelist—Jun II Kwun, founder and managing director at Actium Group—made the case for Dallas as a life-sciences powerhouse, albeit one that he said still needs a critical mass of life-sciences companies and CEOs willing to relocate to North Texas. But, according to participants in a discussion called Advancing Life Sciences and Venture Innovation, that’s happening already. “The Texas life-sciences ecosystem is experiencing remarkable growth, and Dallas has really emerged as an inspiring innovation hub,” said discussion moderator Jenn Yandle, executive director, life sciences-innovation economy for JPMorgan. “In fact, we are seeing one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, and we’re seeing remarkable growth in terms of the expansion of lab space and the deepening of our talent pools and the amount of companies that are making DFW home.”

Bridging the tech-transfer gap

A lynchpin for Dallas’ growth in the sector is Pegasus Park, a 26-acre, biotech and life-sciences development near the Dallas Design Center and the Southwestern Medical District. With tenants like Health Wildcatters, Mass Challenge, and UT Southwestern Medical Center, plus a record of incubating more than 30 companies collectively valued at $14 billion, the complex funded in part by billionaire philanthropist Lyda Hill is bridging the gap between scientific discovery and commercializing those discoveries.

“I remember, right when we were opening Pegasus Park, standing out in the parking lot with a local venture capital family office,” said Nicole Small, CEO of LH Capital. “And he said to me, ‘We really are interested in the healthcare space, but we don’t really know how to get into UT Southwestern, because it’s like over there in those buildings!’ And literally right at that time the head of tech transfer walked through the parking lot and I was like, ‘Oh, let me introduce you two.’ Those are the sort of collisions being created there.”

A “collision” of a different sort—one that occurred a few years ago following a board meeting of Venture Dallas—was described during a panel called Killer Brands: How Liquid Death Disrupted the Beverage Industry. Access Capital co-founder Blake Wiley said the Venture meeting was how he’d met Marissa Bertha, chief strategy officer at Liquid Death, the canned water and beverages brand that’s earned a $1.4 billion valuation thanks to its viral punk/metal marketing campaigns.

Besides Access Capital, the brand’s investors have included other investment firms, family offices, entertainment companies, and aluminum can manufacturers, Bertha said. And, after expanding its offerings from canned water to soda-flavored sparkling water and iced tea, the brand is poised to debut an energy drink in January, she added. “We’ve been able to grow as the most expensive product in every category in which we play,” Bertha said. “We’re the most expensive water, we’re the most expensive flavored sparkling, we’re the most expensive tea. But in the energy category, we will actually be able to be priced at parity.”

‘It’s OK to fail’

Closing out the conference, Capital Factory president and co-founder Bryan Chambers introduced the day’s final three “fireside chats” featuring Draper Associates partner Andy Tang, Keen Technologies founder John Carmack, and Colossal Biosciences co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm.

“Texas isn’t just big, it’s consequential,” Chambers told the crowd. “You may already know that if Texas were a country, it would be the eighth-largest economy in the world. That means the connections and the choices our community makes in rooms like this one ripple globally through supply chains and reach the cloud. Over the next hour and a half, you’re going to hear some more really big ideas.”

Tang alone proved him right. Draper, a prominent, early-stage VC firm that’s backed startups ranging from Tesla and Skype to Robinhood, invests in the likes of AI, robotics and automation, healthcare and biotech, and crypto and blockchain. Tang said that while he’s confident AI represents the “fourth industrial revolution” over the long haul, the transition will bring short-term pain to many in the current workforce. “Better days are ahead,” he said, “but that transition? I’m not sure.”

During his talk, Tang also said he’s optimistic about the safe use of nuclear power, advocated for reasonable cryptocurrency regulation at the federal level, and urged Texas entrepreneurs to be more risk-tolerant. “Here you think big—but let me help you to not, sort of, play too tight,” Tang said. “It’s OK to fail. There’s nothing wrong with failing. That’s one thing I learned from Silicon Valley. I find that in Texas, if we combined these two things—thinking big and [taking] big risks—it could become the next big venture market.”

One entrepreneur who embodies risk-taking is Carmack, the Dallas tech icon who’s now pursuing the keys to artificial general intelligence. In a riveting, “no-nonsense” conversation, Carmack explained that while the capabilities of today’s large language models are amazing, they lack the “classical reinforcement learning abilities” that are needed for continuous learning and long-term retention. As a result, he’s zeroed in at Keen on a “more obscure field of AI, which is reinforcement learning,” Carmack said. And he’s doing so largely by “running Atari simulations on modest numbers of GPUs.”

Dallas-based Keen, which has raised $20 million from various investors including Capital Factory, is grounding these experiments in the physical world, with actual Atari systems on tables with TVs, cameras, and robot controllers moving joysticks, Carmack said. The success of his experiments will be in the actual market value they create, he said, not in whether they “identify the clear bright line of AGI”—a quest he dismissed as “dorm room philosophy, arguments that are completely without value.”

“What are people willing to pay for?” he said. “How much value do they get out of this? I’m comfortable letting that drive most of the marketing investment.”

A sold-out event

The summit’s final speaker was Lamm, whose Dallas-based Colossal focuses on disruptive conservation through “de-extinction efforts,” such as resurrecting the woolly mammoth, the dodo bird, and the dire wolf.

Having attained a valuation of $10.3 billion since its founding in 2021 by Lamm and geneticist George Church, Colossal is taking a “software programming” approach to de-extinction, Lamm said, stressing precision in its gene editing. Its 2024 woolly mouse project, for example, produced 36 healthy mice with exactly targeted phenotypes, making it what Lamm called the most precision-edited multicellular organism on the planet.

The company deploys artificial intelligence across multiple functions—“Without AI, our projects would take 50 years plus,” Lamm said—and has found success on the national stage after oversubscribing every one of its funding rounds. “Anybody who tells you they don’t have trouble raising money is just lying,” Lamm said. “But we’ve also worked hard.”

He added that while he obviously appreciates Colossal’s “economic returns,” he’s motivated as well by the “inspiration aspects” of the company’s work. By that, Lamm said, he means the “promise we’ve made to kids in the world—the people that are rooting for us in your random classroom in Middle America. I think that promise is as big as a promise we make to an investor that gives us $300 million.”

Toward the end of the day, Pierce, the Venture Dallas chair, said the 2025 conference showed that the North Texas startup community has made great strides in the last year or so: It’s attracted new companies like Stablecore, hosted new venture funds like DTX, and watched Colossal attain decacorn status.

“There’s clearly so much energy in our space,” Pierce told Dallas Innovates. “How do we unlock that energy and create more great companies and more good outcomes for investors? It’s clear that something’s happening, and we’re tapping into that energy.”

One indication of this enthusiasm was attendance at the conference itself, he said.

“I look 12 months from where we were last year, and this year there were people outside trying to get into a sold-out event,” Pierce said. “There was a line out the door, with people asking, ‘Hey, can I buy a ticket?’ And sadly, we had to say no. We couldn’t accept one more without violating the venue constraints on capacity. So maybe, in the future, you think about if there’s a venue that can fit even more people.”

The physical transformation needed for the energy transition is advancing, but at about half the pace required to meet global commitments. Less than 15 percent of the low-emissions technologies required to meet Paris-aligned targets by 2050 have been deployed—a few percentage points higher than two years ago.

Deployment advanced in three of the seven parts of the energy system but stalled elsewhere. Momentum is strongest in low-emissions power, electrifying transportation, and critical mineral supplies. Progress is mostly stuck in carbon capture, hydrogen fuels, and heavy industry.

China accounts for about two-thirds of additional solar and wind power and electric vehicle sales since 2022. Emerging economies have stepped up, but the pace of deployment in the United States and the European Union slowed in 2025 in some areas.

The outlook has worsened for the hardest physical challenges of the transition. Advancing the transition will require tackling 25 physical challenges. There are bright spots such as improved range for electric vehicles. But progress on the most demanding challenges, including those related to hydrogen and decarbonizing steel, has been hampered by project cancellations, slow technological progress, and policy shifts.

Understanding the physical realities of the energy transition is more important than ever. This lens clarifies the scale of the task ahead, helping to set priorities amid uneven progress and to pinpoint emerging areas of opportunity and bottlenecks that demand new approaches.

Today’s energy system, encompassing the production and consumption of energy resources, is high performing, deeply enmeshed in the global economy, and has developed over centuries. But for all its advantages, today’s system also has flaws, most notably the fact that it generates more than 85 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Stakeholders around the world are engaged in the task of transforming the system to reduce its emissions. There is growing recognition that this must be done in a way that is affordable, reliable, enables competitiveness, and, in many places in the world, while increasing overall access to energy. More recently, a shifting policy landscape, geopolitical tensions, and surging energy demand from data centers have added further complexity.

In a digital age, we have become accustomed to lightning-fast transformations. However, the energy transition, particularly one that enables these broader objectives, is a challenging undertaking and requires a vast and complex physical transformation.

In 2024, the McKinsey Global Institute report The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transition took stock of where the world stands on this physical transformation. We found that, despite meaningful progress, the transition was in its early stages, with just about 10 percent of the required deployment of low-emissions technologies by 2050 achieved in most areas. The research identified 25 physical challenges that must be overcome for the transition to succeed—from developing and scaling new low-emissions technologies to building the supply chains and infrastructure they depend on.

We grouped the 25 physical challenges into three levels of difficulty. Level 1 challenges require progress on deploying established technologies and face the fewest physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require accelerating deployment of known technologies, along with scaling the associated infrastructure and inputs. In Level 3 challenges—we call these 12 the “demanding dozen”—gaps in technological performance remain (often in demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning.

In this research, we update our assessment of the energy transition with another reality check on where things stand, where progress has been made, and the task ahead. We find that an estimated 13.5 percent of the deployment to meet Paris-aligned goals has now been done. Many factors have driven progress on deployment across regions where it has occurred—emissions reduction goals, but also favorable economics, and the broader imperatives that we have noted. Nevertheless, progress has proceeded at roughly half the pace that would have been required to meet targets aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement, with only a few percentage points of headway in two years.

Against this backdrop, we find a tale of many transitions (Exhibit 1). Deployment has taken place, but it has largely involved only critical minerals, low-emissions power, and electric vehicles (EVs). There has been little movement in hydrogen, carbon capture, or low-emissions technologies for making steel and other key materials.

China accounted for about two-thirds of recent deployment in EVs and in solar and wind power. In the first half of 2025, emerging economies (excluding China) installed more new solar and wind capacity than either the European Union (EU) or the United States, where momentum is slowing.

And what of progress on the 25 challenges that will need to be tackled for the energy transition to succeed? The picture is mixed. Many of the easier challenges are getting solved, but we remain stuck on the most demanding ones, particularly related to improving performance and affordability.

Our aim with this research is to help business leaders and policymakers identify where there is opportunity from the energy transition and where fresh ideas are needed.

The transition is moving at half the pace needed to meet Paris-aligned targets

The energy transition is moving forward, but unevenly. Deployment of solar panels, batteries, and electric cars has been accelerating, for example. Similarly, the supply of critical minerals is rising quickly as new facilities come online, so much so that there are worries of oversupply in the short term. But progress in other areas—notably, decarbonizing heavy industries, scaling hydrogen, and capturing carbon—is largely stuck. Of the seven domains of the energy system we track, three are progressing and accelerating, but four are not.

By the end of 2024, about 13.5 percent of low-emissions technologies needed to meet Paris-aligned 2050 targets across the seven domains we study had been deployed on average. This is about three percentage points of progress in two years. This pace is roughly half of what would be required to meet Paris-aligned targets. Six percentage points on deployment in the past two years would have been in line with such targets (Exhibit 2).

We also analyze how deployment is progressing in each domain by measuring it against a “cruising speed.” By this, we mean a hypothetical constant speed of required annual deployment that is consistent with keeping global warming well below 2°C. While recognizing that progress may not be linear, this approach is a useful way to calibrate how we are going (for more on our approach, see sidebar “Measuring progress”).

Among the domains, raw materials is the only one where progress is outstripping cruising speed (Exhibit 3). Supply of critical minerals has been growing, especially in Africa, China, and Indonesia. Higher investment and an acceleration in the time it takes to bring projects online have put critical minerals on a trajectory that can sustain rapid growth in solar, batteries, and EVs.

Power is also in high gear. Between 2022 and 2024, annual additions of solar, wind, and other low-emissions generation doubled to 600 gigawatts, almost as much as the combined power grids of India and Brazil. Momentum on capacity additions further strengthened in early 2025, with wind and solar collectively up more than 60 percent year on year. The vast majority of these additions were of solar capacity. To put this into perspective, more solar capacity has been added since 2022 than in all previous years. If the pace holds, global capacity additions could reach a cruising speed of about 1,000 gigawatts of new low-emissions power annually before 2030.

Mobility is another bright spot. By mid-2025, about one in four passenger cars sold worldwide was electric. Global sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrid cars reached 17 million in 2024, up 70 percent from 2022, and momentum carried into 2025. Still, a reality check is in order: Volumes would need to more than triple, to around 60 million a year, for this domain to reach cruising speed.

In the other domains—buildings, industry, hydrogen, and carbon management—the story is far less encouraging. Although sales of heat pumps are above prepandemic levels, the surge in deployment of heat pumps after Europe’s 2022 gas price shock has receded. In the other three domains, deployment remains negligible.

Even in the accelerating domains of power, mobility, and raw materials, it is certainly too soon to declare victory on their ability to reach cruising speed. There are two important caveats. First, so far, China has driven the lion’s share of progress. If these domains are to keep growing and reach their cruising speed, progress will have to be more global. Second, as we discussed in our 2024 report, as deployment advances, it can become harder. For example, as more renewables are introduced into power generation, the system can become more volatile.

The next two chapters examine precisely these two aspects: regional differences and the physical challenges that need to be tackled for the energy transition to succeed.

China accounts for two-thirds of deployment, but emerging economies are stepping up

The geography of deployment in the energy transition is also not even and is shifting. China sits at the front, emerging economies are moving faster, and deployment in advanced economies is slowing down in some areas. In the domains that are accelerating, notably power and mobility, China has been responsible for around two-thirds of deployment in recent years (Exhibit 4).

China is playing the largest role globally in deploying low-emissions technologies

China is the world’s largest emitter of CO2 and has also accounted for most increases in emissions since 2022. Fossil fuels provide about 87 percent of China’s energy supply, and its electricity grid is still heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels for more than 60 percent of generation.

Nonetheless, China also accounts for the most progress in the deployment of low-emissions technologies. Since 2022, China has delivered nearly two-thirds of all new global capacity of solar and wind power. In the first half of 2025, this figure reached three-quarters. This boom now gives China almost a quarter of the low-emissions power needed to meet its share of 2050 deployment targets—nearly double the global average.

China’s role in mobility is just as notable. China accounts for six out of ten passenger EVs and nine out of every ten electric trucks on the road. In the first half of 2025, passenger EVs sold in China accounted for almost 65 percent of global sales. China has already reached 19 percent of the EV deployment needed by mid-century, compared with just 3 percent elsewhere.

Momentum in the United States and Europe slowed in 2025

In 2024, the United States added about 40 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, a 60 percent jump from 2022 additions. But in the first half of 2025, new additions were flat compared with the same period in the previous years. EV sales also hit a plateau after years of rapid growth.

In Europe, deployment is also advancing at a slower pace in some areas. The EU added about 70 gigawatts of solar and wind in 2024—a 40 percent increase relative to 2022—but as in the United States, there hasn’t been any year-on-year growth in 2025. By contrast, EV adoption continued to climb, with passenger EV sales up more than 20 percent in the first half of 2025, compared with a year earlier.

Nevertheless, progress on deployment can be found within each of these regions. For instance, in the United States, some states moved ahead faster. While installations of solar power in the United States overall were up by less than 5 percent in the first six months of 2025, compared with a year earlier, several states, including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, and Texas, grew installations by 15 to 80 percent. A similar picture played out in the EU, where Spain and France increased the solar and wind capacity installed by around 35 and 25 percent, respectively.

Emerging economies stepped up deployment

Perhaps the most striking development has been the increased role of deployment of low-emissions technologies in emerging economies. Since 2022, the additions of solar and wind power have grown faster than in the United States or the EU. In fact, in the first six months of 2025, emerging economies installed an estimated 30 gigawatts, similar to the EU. India alone added more than 20 gigawatts—more solar and wind power than the United States during that period.

Much of this momentum has been fueled by Chinese exports. Solar exports to emerging economies doubled from 2022 to 2024, overtaking those to high-income economies. Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have emerged as leading importers while demand across Africa has also surged. The growth of distributed generation (for example, solar panels installed on the rooftops of people’s homes) is a big driver, helping extend access in markets where central grid expansion is slower.

EV adoption in emerging markets is also accelerating. Between 2022 and 2024, their share of global EV car sales almost doubled, from about 3 percent to 5 percent. In the first half of 2025, the number increased to 7 percent—roughly equal to the US total. The growth has been striking in economies like Brazil, where sales jumped from about 20,000 in 2022 to more than 120,000 in 2024, and in Southeast Asian countries, where sales grew from around 40,000 to more than 200,000 in the same period, a fivefold rise.

The hardest stuff may be getting harder

While progress has been achieved in deploying low-emissions technologies, the transition remains in its early stages, and progress is far from even. Achieving the remainder of the energy transition will require addressing 25 physical challenges, as outlined in our 2024 report. Examples of physical challenges are managing power systems with a large share of variable renewables, addressing range and payload challenges in electric trucks, and finding alternative heat sources, feedstocks, and processes for producing industrial materials.

In 2024–25, we find that many of the (relatively) easy physical challenges are being solved, but the hardest ones remain broadly stuck. Since 2022, almost no progress has been made on the demanding dozen. However, about half of energy-related emissions depend on tackling these challenges (Exhibit 5).

Easier challenges are being solved

In this update, we found that the 13 challenges previously categorized as Level 1 and 2 remained in those categories. But many of them continue to experience forward momentum. There has been progress in the form of continued technological improvement and removal of bottlenecks to help with scaling in six of them since our 2024 report.

Most progress was in electrification-related areas and improvements in underlying technologies. Batteries are a prime example. Their energy density has improved 10 to 20 percent across different chemistries, which has extended the range of EVs (challenge 8). Furthermore, the increased use of chemistries such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has led to the reduction in both emissions from manufacturing and the cost of manufacturing EVs, improving the breakeven distance of EVs in comparison with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in terms of their carbon (and cost) savings (challenge 7).

Having sufficient clean firm power as a complement to variable renewables (challenge 6) has also progressed. While deployment of clean firm power has not advanced meaningfully since 2022, new technologies promise to create new options even if they are a few years away from mass commercialization. Geothermal drilling times have fallen by about 80 percent; pilots for enhanced geothermal systems have launched in the United States; and a few small modular reactors (SMRs) are actively under construction, including in Argentina, China, Russia, and the United States, with more than 30 in the design stage.

That is the good news, but of the comparatively easy Level 1 and 2 challenges, there are still six where progress has, on balance, been neutral, often with both positive and negative developments.

And in one case, the negatives outweighed the positives. The grid is a growing bottleneck (challenge 5). Supply chain constraints have pushed transformer and cable prices up by about a third since 2022, while delivery times have doubled to two or three years. At the same time, the IEA has estimated that 1,650 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity globally were awaiting connection in 2024, due to grid investment and permitting delays. That is equivalent to six times Germany’s current generation capacity. Expanding the grid is critical to the entire transition to, for instance, support the connection of new low-emissions power sources, integrate storage, and enable EV charging.

Overall, policy has had a mixed impact on the pace of the transition. In the case of Level 1 and Level 2 challenges, policy measures did offer some tailwinds. One example is reforms to nuclear permitting that streamline approvals for early-stage projects, including advanced reactor designs (challenge 6). In Europe, recent initiatives streamlined permitting to secure critical mineral supplies (challenge 19) and expanded support for heat electrification (challenge 16).

But for the hardest—Level 3—challenges, the picture looks meaningfully different.

Level 3 challenges are mostly stuck, despite a few bright spots

Solving Level 3 challenges requires meaningful technology advances, establishing a track record of deployment to build scale, and solutions to complex interdependencies. However, during the past two years, the opposite has occurred for many Level 3 challenges. Attempts to tackle five of the demanding dozen challenges are mostly experiencing negative trends.

Across these five, of course there has been some innovation, such as the emergence of new types of hydrogen electrolyzers and new processes for producing industrial materials. However, by and large, more effort is needed to improve performance and costs in these areas. Moreover, a deteriorating economic background together with policy shifts (some in 2025) have prompted the cancellation of many of the few pilot projects that had been underway. So, progress toward commercial scale has been negligible (see sidebar “New forces are reshaping the transition”).

Consider hydrogen’s two physical challenges—deploying hydrogen in an efficient way (challenge 20) and scaling hydrogen infrastructure (challenge 21). These have come up against significant headwinds. Cancellations of more than 50 hydrogen projects were announced from 2024 to mid-2025. A wave of cancellations has also hit downstream projects reliant on hydrogen, including low-emissions steel projects (challenge 12) in Germany; ammonia production (challenge 15) in Australia; and more than 15 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects for aviation (challenge 11).

Having said this, there have been success stories even within Level 3. Better batteries and improvements in design, such as aerodynamics, have enabled electric trucks (challenge 9) to reach longer average ranges. Many original equipment manufacturers have extended the ranges of their flagship models, many of which can now travel more than 600 kilometers without recharging. The performance gap with diesel is narrowing. Battery electric trucks can now serve use cases that were previously thought to need low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen. Furthermore, megawatt charging systems are offering faster charging than ever before. They could charge the average heavy-duty truck in about 15 minutes—half the time of an ultra-fast charging system. The global stock of medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks more than tripled between 2022 and 2024. Still, they are at less than 1 percent of the 2050 target, and about 90 percent of them are in China.

In heavy industry, cement has similarly bucked the trend. In 2025, the world’s first full-scale cement carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) plant came online in Norway, and a pilot plasma-heated kiln came online in Sweden. These were both milestones in tackling one of the toughest industrial decarbonization challenges.

Navigating the physical realities

The past two years have shown that the energy transition is moving in many directions at once. Some barriers are falling, while others seem to be getting taller. Overall, a nuanced understanding of the physical challenges and where there are headwinds and tailwinds remains critical for leaders looking to navigate the energy transition. (For details of all 25 physical challenges, see the appendix: “Progress report, 2024–25.”)

Progress on what were already the Level 1 and 2 challenges has opened new opportunities. But making further headway will take more disciplined execution, both to maintain the pace of progress in challenges where it has been made and to accelerate where it hasn’t. For business leaders, advantage will come from anticipating the next constraint and positioning early to remove it. The organizations most likely to succeed will be those that treat execution as a source of competitive advantage.

The hardest obstacles—Level 3 challenges—still depend on innovation, both in individual technologies and across entire systems. As our 2024 report discussed, it is essential to keep testing how technologies fit together within a wider system and how their roles may evolve. In the past two years, breakthroughs in low-emissions cement and electric trucks show that there is rarely a single route forward. For a long time, low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen were seen as the main way to match the performance of fossil fuels in these applications. Now denser batteries for trucks and electric and plasma-heated kilns for cement are pushing electrification ahead. Similar shifts could reshape other industries and open new paths to solving the demanding dozen.

Tackling the physical challenges of the energy transition remains hard stuff. There is progress but there are also headwinds. Building the capacity to read the landscape and act quickly on opportunities will matter more than ever. Clearly seeing the physical realities and how they change will help leaders steer toward lower emissions while ensuring an affordable, reliable, and competitive path to net zero.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/the%20hard%20stuff%202025%20taking%20stock%20of%20progress%20on%20the%20physical%20challenges%20of%20the%20energy%20transition/the%20hard%20stuff%202025%20update-1352147326-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 11:08:09.154503

This brownfield expansion north of Toronto represents more than just another industrial project—it embodies a fundamental shift toward domestic supply chain resilience in the battery materials sector.

The project's specifications demonstrate significant industrial scale ambitions. With an annual production capacity of 6,500 tonnes of battery-grade cobalt sulfate, the facility positions itself as a cornerstone asset for regional battery manufacturing. The comprehensive financing structure totaling US$82 million reflects sophisticated risk management, combining US$48 million in non-dilutive government support with private investment capital.

Table: Electra Battery Materials Cobalt Refinery Key Metrics

Metric Value Annual Production Capacity 6,500 tonnes battery-grade cobalt sulfate Total Project Financing US$82 million Government Support US$48 million (non-dilutive) Target Commissioning Date 2027 Construction Restart Date November 2025 Location North of Toronto, Ontario

The brownfield nature of this development significantly reduces execution risk compared to greenfield alternatives. Major processing equipment remains on-site from previous operations, concrete foundations are completed, and infrastructure has been upgraded to support full capacity operations. This existing asset base provides a substantial head start toward operational readiness.

Furthermore, the strategic timing of this restart aligns with broader North American policy initiatives supporting domestic critical minerals processing. The facility targets commissioning in 2027, positioning it to meet growing regional demand for battery-grade materials as electric vehicle production scales and grid storage deployment accelerates across the continent.

Breaking Down the US$82 Million Financing Structure

The financing architecture of this cobalt refinery project reveals sophisticated government-private sector collaboration. The US$48 million in government support represents approximately 58.5% of total project costs, demonstrating unprecedented public sector commitment to critical minerals infrastructure development.

This tri-national government backing involves coordinated support from United States federal agencies, Canadian federal programmes, and Ontario provincial economic development initiatives. The non-dilutive structure of government support preserves shareholder equity while providing essential risk mitigation for project completion.

Key Investment Structure Components:

• Government Support (58.5%): US$48 million across three jurisdictions

• Private Investment (41.5%): US$34 million in equity and debt financing

• Risk Profile: Significantly reduced through public-private partnership model

• Repayment Terms: Non-dilutive government support minimises equity dilution

The financing model demonstrates how government policy can effectively catalyse private investment in strategic industrial capacity. Unlike traditional subsidies or grants, this structure aligns public policy objectives with commercial viability, creating sustainable foundations for long-term operations.

The Role of Tri-National Government Backing

The coordination between American, Canadian, and provincial government agencies represents a notable evolution in North American industrial policy. This alignment reflects shared strategic interests in reducing dependence on overseas processing capacity for materials critical to defence, industrial, and energy transition applications.

In addition, the critical minerals policy shift emphasises domestic processing capabilities, making projects like this increasingly valuable for national security objectives.

The combination of US, Canadian, and Ontario government support totalling US$48 million represents nearly 60% of the project's financing, demonstrating unprecedented policy alignment for critical minerals onshoring.

Government support mechanisms likely include combinations of direct capital contributions, loan guarantees, tax incentives, and accelerated depreciation schedules. The specific allocation between federal and provincial jurisdictions reflects the cross-border nature of North American battery supply chains and shared economic interests in domestic processing capacity.

Strategic Importance for Defence and Industrial Applications

Cobalt sulfate serves essential functions across defence electronics, aerospace components, and high-performance industrial applications beyond battery manufacturing. Domestic processing capacity reduces supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact critical national infrastructure and defence systems.

The refinery's capacity to produce 6,500 tonnes annually addresses significant market demand. Battery-grade cobalt sulfate specifications require purity levels exceeding 99.5% with strict limits on iron, nickel, copper, and manganese contamination. These technical standards ensure compatibility with advanced battery manufacturing processes used by major cell producers.

Understanding Battery-Grade Cobalt Requirements

Battery-grade cobalt sulfate represents a highly specialised intermediate product in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The material serves as a precursor for cathode active materials, particularly in nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) battery chemistries commonly used in electric vehicles and consumer electronics.

The technical specifications for battery-grade cobalt sulfate extend beyond basic purity requirements. Manufacturing processes demand consistent particle size distribution, controlled moisture content, and specific dissolution characteristics that enable uniform cathode material production. These parameters directly impact battery cell performance, cycle life, and safety characteristics.

Current battery industry trends show increasing demand for cobalt-containing cathodes despite ongoing efforts to reduce cobalt content per cell. Higher energy density requirements for electric vehicle applications and grid storage systems maintain strong demand for cobalt-based materials, even as individual battery chemistries evolve.

North American Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

The current global cobalt production landscape reveals significant geographic concentration risks that this refinery aims to address. Asian processing facilities, particularly in China, handle the majority of global cobalt intermediate processing, creating potential supply chain bottlenecks for North American manufacturers.

Table: Global Cobalt Processing Landscape

Region Processing Capacity Market Share Strategic Control China Dominant 70%+ High Democratic Republic of Congo Raw material source N/A Limited North America Emerging <5% Growing

This concentration creates multiple vulnerability points: transportation logistics, currency exchange risks, trade policy uncertainties, and potential supply disruptions during geopolitical tensions. North American battery manufacturers currently depend on lengthy supply chains that transport raw cobalt from African mines through Asian processing facilities before reaching domestic battery production facilities.

Consequently, the Electra Battery Materials cobalt refinery construction restart addresses these vulnerabilities by establishing domestic processing capability that can handle multiple feedstock sources, including recycled battery materials, North American mining outputs, and diversified international raw material inputs.

The Economics of Midstream Processing

Cobalt midstream processing economics involve significant value addition between raw materials and finished battery-grade products. Processing margins typically reflect the technical complexity, quality control requirements, and market positioning of refined products versus raw cobalt concentrates or hydroxides.

The brownfield development approach provides economic advantages through reduced capital expenditure compared to greenfield alternatives. Existing infrastructure, equipment, and site preparation eliminate substantial upfront costs while accelerating time-to-production timelines.

Economic Value Drivers:

• Processing margins: Value addition between raw cobalt and battery-grade sulfate

Three-quarters of countries that have submitted new NDCs plan to displace fossil fuels in their electricity system with clean energy, showing clear movement on the transition.
COP30 must bring urgency and acceleration to the global energy transition","Collective action is bending the emissions curve downwards, but not nearly fast enough. As countries gather for COP30 in Belém, leaders must build on their recent statement to strengthen political confidence in the inevitability of the shift to clean energy, demonstrating real-world progress that goes beyond their NDCs and showing genuine commitment to accelerate the transitions to clean energy globally.

Global emissions are projected to fall 19 – 24% below 2019 levels by 2035 if all commitments in countries’ climate plans (NDCs) so far are fulfilled, including those conditional on finance and international support. This is insufficient for a global pathway to limit warming to 1.5 °C. NDCs must be the floor, not the ceiling, of ambition.

Energy accounts for more than three-quarters of total global emissions, making decarbonising the energy sector a critical part of the mitigation challenge. While year-on-year record-breaking renewables deployment is mirrored in countries’ climate plans, more is needed to triple renewable capacity, and a major step up is required to deliver on the full energy package agreed at COP28, including the Global Stocktake (GST) commitments to double energy efficiency and to transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables deployment accelerates as countries see the opportunities…

The benefits of clean energy deployment are increasingly reflected in countries’ climate plans. Approximately 90% of newly submitted NDCs mention plans to increase renewable energy capacity, and three-quarters reference an intent to increase the share of renewables in the power mix, displacing fossil fuels.

Despite this, many NDCs still fail to truly reflect both the momentous opportunities of clean energy and the real-world progress already made.

Renewable energy deployment figures were the highest on record in 2024 for the third consecutive year, and solar PV capacity additions are on track to reach, and even exceed, the required capacity by 2030 for a 1.5°C world.

Renewable energy costs continue to plummet. They are now comfortably cheaper than new fossil fuels in most markets, while the cost of battery storage has collapsed by nearly 90% since 2015, making dispatchable renewable power a reality.

The deployment of non-hydro renewable capacity has enhanced energy security in fossil fuel-importing countries. Renewables installed since 2010 saved an estimated US$1.3 trillion in cumulative global imports of coal and natural gas through 2023. Without additions, imports of coal and natural gas would have been 45% higher in 2023.

The challenge, however, is pace. The world is not moving at the speed required to meet the goal to triple renewables capacity by 2030, with global projections putting the world at 2.7x rather than 3x. Most of this deployment is concentrated in advanced economies and China, with clean energy investments going to EMDEs a mere 15% of the global total. On energy efficiency, the latest data shows we are a long way off from the goal – improvement in energy intensity is currently around 1% per year, when 4% in needed.

…But the transition away from fossil fuels requires urgent attention

The shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel continued this year as global power generation from renewables outstripped coal for the first time. Latin America and the Caribbean are now free of actively planned coal-fired power plants and No New Coal is a norm in 164 countries. In 2025, stalled and cancelled coal proposals led to a record low in the number of countries proposing or building new coal plants.

Three-quarters of countries that have submitted new NDCs plan to displace fossil fuels in their electricity system with clean energy, showing clear movement on the transition. However, very few have explicitly set out plans for transitioning away from fossil fuels beyond the power sector, in the whole energy system and economy.

A few first movers – Barbados, Chile, Colombia, Iceland and Vanuatu – have strong plans and state intentions to be fossil fuel free.

No country has provided a timeline for reducing oil and gas production, though Canada, Colombia and the UK have referenced plans to start winding down. Eight countries have used their climate plans to commit to boosting gas production.

These plans are all in stark contrast to the global agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, and to the clear economic benefits of the transition. A poll among business executives in 15 major economies, including the US, found that 97% support the switch.

As a result, local water utilities have spent millions of dollars to prevent saltwater from flowing out of Hilton Head taps.
The City of Savannah has also started using river water for its drinking water supply instead of relying solely on the Floridan aquifer.
The state of South Carolina instituted limits on how much water Hilton Head could withdraw from the Floridan aquifer in 1997.
Hilton Head public service districts estimate the total cost to address the issue has exceeded $129 million.","On an island in many ways defined by the water, the quest to get it fresh and flowing from Hilton Head’s taps is one with a fraught history.

The closure of International Paper in Savannah led to the overused Floridan aquifer, historically Hilton Head’s main water source, rising about two feet at a Hutchinson Island monitoring well, according to reporting from The Current.

Overpumping of the aquifer in and around Savannah has contributed to a decades-long issue with saltwater intrusion on Hilton Head, as saltwater has slowly crept into the island’s wells. The paper mill was one of the biggest users of water from the Floridan aquifer in the region. As a result, local water utilities have spent millions of dollars to prevent saltwater from flowing out of Hilton Head taps.

International Paper announced earlier this year that it would close its containerboard plants in Savannah and Riceboro. By mid-October, the water level recorded in a monitoring well on Hutchinson Island had risen compared to the readings in late September, when the mill shut down.

The slow, steady march of salt

Saltwater intrusion occurs when too much water is pulled out of an aquifer faster than it is replaced. Aquifers are typically replenished by rainfall, but if withdrawals occur faster than the aquifer can be replenished a “cone of depression” forms where the water table is lowered in an area due to overuse.

Before the region was developed, fresh groundwater flowed underground towards the ocean.

A natural breach in the aquifer sat under the Port Royal Sound, discharging enough water from the aquifer that Spanish ship captains would use freshwater springs in the sound to stock up on drinking water while anchored, Jim Reichard, a geology professor at Georgia Southern University, said. The flow is now reversed in the area, with saltwater from the sound entering the freshwater aquifer.

But as more water was pumped out of the upper Floridan aquifer in Savannah and later Hilton Head, it changed the direction in which the water moved through the aquifer. This alteration in its natural flow has resulted in saltwater leaching into the freshwater aquifers that the island used for drinking water. While some upper Floridan wells on the island are still in use, many have been lost to saltwater intrusion.

“So it’s mostly caused by the huge withdrawals in Savannah,” Riechard said. “Hilton Head obviously contributed to that, but the bulk of the problem is caused by the large industrial municipal withdrawals in Savannah.”

Limits on aquifer use lead to improvements

Riechard said the aquifer level at that well has been steadily improving for some time now due to Georgia’s limits on groundwater withdrawals. The City of Savannah has also started using river water for its drinking water supply instead of relying solely on the Floridan aquifer.

While Hilton Head’s own water usage has contributed to its issues with saltwater intrusion, much of the problem stems from the heavy industrial water use in Savannah, Riechard said.

International Paper had one of the largest water withdrawal permits in the area, according to an analysis from The Current.

Salt water reached Hilton Head’s wells about 100 years before it was expected to impact Savannah, which led to tensions between the two states, according to previous reporting from The Island Packet.

In 2012, South Carolina was prepared to bring the issue to federal court, though the lawsuit never materialized. Dean Moss, former general manager for the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority and member of the S.C. Governor’s Savannah River Committee, said that Savannah and Beaufort County’s ongoing transition to Savannah River water has helped the issue. Even so, the 120-year-old saltwater intrusion problem has never been completely fixed.

The state of South Carolina instituted limits on how much water Hilton Head could withdraw from the Floridan aquifer in 1997. Over the past 25 years, water utilities across Beaufort and Jasper counties have made extensive changes to their water supply, coming to rely more on water from the Savannah River, or digging wells to deeper aquifers.

Hilton Head public service districts estimate the total cost to address the issue has exceeded $129 million. As more wells are pulled offline, they anticipate spending another $80 million.",https://www.islandpacket.com/public/latest-news/icdx78/picture312607284/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/InternationalPaperMillBoxPlantDM.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:41.653914

According to Renub Research, the United States Electric Vehicle Market is projected to reach US$ 537.53 billion by 2033, growing from US$ 200.76 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 11.56% between 2025 and 2033.

The EV revolution in the U.S. is being powered by a surge in environmental awareness, cutting-edge battery technology, and supportive government policies. As concerns about climate change intensify, Americans are rapidly shifting toward greener mobility alternatives. Incentives like federal tax credits, expanding public charging networks, and lower operating costs are making electric vehicles (EVs) more appealing than ever.

United States Electric Vehicle Industry Overview

The U.S. electric vehicle industry is witnessing dynamic transformation as automakers introduce diverse models across price ranges and categories. From compact cars to mid-size SUVs, brands like Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Tesla are leading the charge with innovative, affordable options that appeal to both luxury and budget-conscious consumers.

For instance, Hyundai launched its updated 2025 IONIQ 5 lineup in September 2024, including the IONIQ 5 XRT edition tailored for off-road enthusiasts. These models boast improved range, enhanced safety systems, and next-gen connectivity—reflecting the ongoing race among automakers to capture a fast-evolving market.

However, challenges remain. One of the most pressing is the uneven distribution of charging infrastructure, especially in rural and suburban regions. While urban areas have seen rapid charger deployment, large parts of the U.S. heartland remain underserved.

According to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), cities with higher charger density show the greatest EV adoption. The ten largest U.S. metro areas have 935 public chargers per million residents, but areas where half of the population lives host only 20% of total charging stations. This disparity underscores the urgent need for expanded public charging infrastructure to sustain growth.

Growth Drivers of the U.S. Electric Vehicle Market

1. Government Incentives and Subsidies Powering Growth

Federal and state-level incentives are the backbone of U.S. EV adoption. Many states offer benefits such as tax credits, rebates, free parking, reduced tolls, and discounted registration fees.

California offers rebates on plug-in hybrids and zero-emission vehicles, with extra incentives for low-income households.

Louisiana and Maryland provide tax credits of up to US$ 2,500–3,000 per vehicle.

Washington and New Jersey exempt EVs from sales and use taxes entirely.

These initiatives not only make EVs financially attractive but also accelerate the transition toward sustainable transportation.

2. Stringent Emission Norms and the Push Toward Zero-Emission Vehicles

The U.S. government’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a major catalyst for EV adoption. Several states are implementing Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates requiring automakers to sell a certain percentage of emission-free vehicles.

By 2020, two-thirds of national EV sales came from states with ZEV programs. This has prompted automakers to significantly ramp up their R&D investments.

A notable example is General Motors’ 2035 pledge to phase out gasoline-powered passenger vehicles entirely—a transformative move that signals the American automotive industry's electric future.

3. Battery Advancements and Extended Driving Range

Battery technology innovation remains the cornerstone of EV evolution. Breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries and battery management systems (BMS) are boosting energy density, reducing costs, and extending range.

These advances have alleviated “range anxiety,” a long-standing barrier to EV adoption. Vehicles offering over 300 miles per charge are becoming increasingly common, making them suitable for both urban commuting and long-distance travel.

Moreover, ongoing research in solid-state batteries promises even faster charging, higher safety, and lower production costs—potentially revolutionizing the next generation of electric vehicles.

Key Challenges in the United States Electric Vehicle Market

1. Competition from Legacy Automakers

While EV startups like Rivian, Lucid Motors, and Fisker have drawn attention, established automakers are reclaiming dominance. General Motors, Ford, Toyota, and BMW are leveraging their existing production infrastructure and brand equity to scale EV output rapidly.

This intensified competition has a dual impact—stimulating innovation while putting pressure on new entrants to differentiate themselves through unique value propositions in performance, design, and technology.

2. Limited Model Variety in Specific Segments

Despite a surge in EV options, gaps remain in certain categories—particularly electric trucks and affordable compact cars. Many consumers, especially in rural states where trucks are essential for work, find limited choices in the EV segment.

This shortage hinders adoption among middle-income and utility-focused buyers. Expanding product portfolios to include more accessible, practical EV models will be essential for holistic market growth.

Segment Insights: Key Market Breakdowns

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) Take the Lead

Battery Electric Vehicles dominate the U.S. market, fueled by environmental awareness, strong incentives, and technological progress. BEVs’ zero tailpipe emissions, low operational costs, and enhancing range have made them the preferred choice for consumers and automakers alike.

Future Outlook: Steering Toward an Electrified Tomorrow

The United States Electric Vehicle Market stands at a crucial inflection point. By 2033, one in every two new vehicles sold could be electric, marking a monumental shift in consumer behavior and energy consumption patterns.

Ongoing federal investments in EV infrastructure, coupled with corporate sustainability commitments, will continue to propel innovation. As technology costs fall and energy sources become greener, EVs are poised to become the default choice for American drivers—ushering in a clean, connected, and carbon-free transportation era.

Final Thoughts

The U.S. electric vehicle boom isn’t just an automotive revolution—it’s an environmental imperative and an economic opportunity. With Renub Research forecasting a US$ 537.53 billion market by 2033, America is on track to become a global leader in sustainable mobility.

The road ahead is charged—with innovation, collaboration, and a collective drive to electrify the future.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/690c8d9ffd5702001d3aba61.jpg",N,,2025-11-06 11:08:21.278660

So, the Sierra Club and its allies should be celebrating this pipeline as a carbon cutting miracle rather than opposing it.
This should be celebrated by the Sierra Club and the rest as a victory for the climate.
According to the InfluenceWatch profile of the Sierra Club: From 2007 through 2010, the Sierra Club took over $25 million from the natural gas industry.
The Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy aren’t behaving as if they are opposed to carbon emissions.","Last Friday, the Sierra Club issued a news release opposing construction of the Southeast Supply Enhancement natural gas pipeline through Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama. Additional opponents of the project have included the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

According to Williams, the energy firm hoping to build the pipeline, it will carry fuel “equivalent to what is needed to serve approximately 9.8 million homes.” Even a news release from the Southern Environmental Law Center concedes this will be enough to service up to six new gas-fired power plants.

According to Scientific American, when natural gas is used to fire a power plant it “emits about half of the carbon dioxide emissions as conventional coal plants.” This claim is supported by data from the Department of Energy. So, the Sierra Club and its allies should be celebrating this pipeline as a carbon cutting miracle rather than opposing it. Their decision not to do so exposes them as anti-energy groups masquerading as environmentalists.

When that Scientific American report was produced in 2010, the American electricity sector was a few years into a major shift to using natural gas rather than coal. In 2007, the historic peak for American CO2 emissions, coal-fired power plants produced 48.7 percent of American electricity, and natural gas just 21.6 percent. By 2023, the mix had flipped to 42.4 percent gas and 15.9 percent coal.

As reported earlier by the Capital Research Center, this tradeoff resulted in a 510 million metric ton annual increase in CO2 emissions from burning natural gas, but a decline of 1.4 billion metric tons from the reduced coal use. The difference—a net decline of 893 million metric tons of annual CO2 –exceeded the total combined annual CO2 emissions of France and Germany. (Note: that’s their total economies, not just their electricity generation.)

In simple terms this means that Americans switching from coal to natural gas in just our electricity generation has cancelled out the combined total carbon footprint of two of the world’s seven largest economies.

By making it possible to add more gas-fired electricity rather than coal power plants, the Southeast Supply Enhancement project will help continue this progress. This should be celebrated by the Sierra Club and the rest as a victory for the climate. Instead, they’re opposed.

Why?

Another revealing fact about the aforementioned opponents of natural gas is that they each also oppose nuclear power, which produces functionally zero CO2 emissions. Nuclear is by far the cleanest electricity option we have. And if we exclude weather dependent and grid destabilizing power sources, such as wind and solar, nuclear is overwhelmingly the cleanest reliable power option humanity has ever created.

The Sierra Club boasts of being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” Just within the last six years the Southern Environmental Law Center has opposed the use of nuclear power in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. And Appalachian Voices is so twisted around on the issue that in 2022 they even opposed hooking up a small modular nuclear reactor on the site of an abandoned Virginia coal mine.

The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy falsely denounced nuclear power as a “high-risk” energy source on a web page that is now conspicuously missing. (The page was still available in 2024.) Nonetheless, the NGO’s news releases covering 2025 still demonstrate sustained hostility to the electricity source that Our World in Data has judged so safe and clean that it kills 25 percent fewer people per kilowatt-hour than even wind turbines, and emits 88 percent less CO2 than solar panels.

In a final hint of hypocrisy, some of these NGOs were once friendly to natural gas. According to the InfluenceWatch profile of the Sierra Club:

From 2007 through 2010, the Sierra Club took over $25 million from the natural gas industry. Most of the donations came from Aubrey McClendon, the CEO of Chesapeake Energy, which is involved in fracking. The money was used to help promote the “Beyond Coal” campaign.

As noted above, this was during the period before natural gas became our major carbon cutting replacement for coal.

Anti-gas and anti-nuclear. The Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy aren’t behaving as if they are opposed to carbon emissions. What they’re really opposed to is every reliable power source that we have.

They are not environmental NGOs. They are anti-energy NGOs.",https://capitalresearch.org/app/uploads/truck-11.png,N,,2025-11-06 09:05:15.646497

Exit polls following Tuesday’s contests showed voters in Virginia and New Jersey were motivated primarily by opposition to President Donald Trump and disappointment in the economy when they handed Democrats sweeping electoral wins.

Democrats have already been hitting electric utility costs as a top messaging point ahead of midterms. They’re seeking to blame Trump and Republicans for price increases across the country, pointing to factors like Trump’s cancellation of wind and solar projects and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s termination of clean energy tax credits.

Now, the wins for Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and others are giving Democrats hope — although Republicans have sought to downplay their importance. Voters identified the cost of living as a top concern and electricity as one of the main drivers.

Down-ballot races similarly heavily favored Democrats, as did a pair of statewide races for Georgia’s Public Service Commission.

“Yesterday, from coast to coast, voters sent a resounding message that they reject the Republican agenda. They are raising costs on everything from health care to housing to utilities,” Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told reporters Wednesday.

“Trump and House Republicans promised on Day 1 to lower costs and they’ve broken that promise over and over and over again. It’s going to cost them the House majority,” she continued.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called the election a rejection of the Trump agenda and promised that Democrats “will continue to lead on the issue of affordability.”

Democrats in the Senate are similarly bullish.

“It should serve as nothing short of a five-alarm fire to the Republicans. Their high-cost house is burning. And they’ve only got themselves to blame,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

“The election showed that Democrats’ control of the U.S. Senate is much closer than the people and the prognosticators realize,” he continued. “The more Republicans double down on raising costs and bowing down to Trump, the more the Senate majority is at risk.”

“People don’t like bans on solar energy, which is right now the cheapest and quickest way to get electricity onto the grid,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a leading Democratic voice on climate change and clean energy, said of the outcomes.

“In New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia, they all ran on a cheap, clean energy message, and it worked,” he continued.

Both Spanberger and Sherrill made electricity prices a major focus of their campaigns, as both states saw double-digital percentage growth in costs. Spanberger promised to protect residents from shouldering costs associated with the booming data center industry, while Sherrill said she’d freeze rate hikes.

Their Republican opponents tried to push back with their own solutions. In Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears blamed wind and solar and promised to get the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, while New Jersey’s Jack Ciattarelli said he’d reopen shut-down nuclear power plants.

Dan Kanninen, a Democratic strategist and founder of Arc Initiatives, said this week’s races demonstrate that Democrats can win on affordability and show the beginnings of a road map to doing so in the midterm elections.

“The key for Democrats will be to continue to focus on affordability and not take the gains last night for granted. And as Republicans inevitably try to change their talking points, Dems need to remind voters what Republicans actually did when they took power,” he said via email.

“They crawled over broken glass to deliver tax cuts to billionaires, then promptly abandoned — or even callously punished — everyone else out of pure retribution politics,” Kanninen added.

Luke Bassett, director of energy security at the Searchlight Institute, said a key takeaway from the races is that each successful candidate used issues tailored to their constituencies, not just a single national message.

Bassett’s group has been encouraging Democrats to talk less about climate change and instead espouse other policies that could help the climate, like adding solar and wind generation to the grid.

“It’s less about one particular message and more about the skill the candidates are showing in being responsive to their voters. And that translates, hopefully, to the same skill set that other candidates in other districts or states or cities, etc., can use,” he said.

Republicans are far from throwing in the towel on energy prices. It was a topic of discussion Wednesday morning when Trump brought Senate Republicans to the White House for breakfast, said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).

“President Trump and the work that we’re doing is bringing those prices down from the inflation created by the Biden administration. But we need to make sure people know that,” Hoeven said in an interview.

The lesson from this week’s elections is that “we need to talk about it more and get the word out,” he added.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) all but dismissed the impact of the elections, with the exception of Zohran Mamdani’s win in the New York City mayoral race.

House Republicans doubled down on their efforts to connect Democrats with Mamdani and his support for democratic socialism, saying House Democrats across the board “have embraced him with open arms.”

“Off-year elections are not indicative of what’s to come. That’s what history teaches us,” Johnson told reporters.

“When we go into next year and the midterms, we’re very bullish about the outcome. We have an extraordinary record to run on,” he added, asserting that: “We’ve got American energy dominance revved and going again.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/4a/2c/cb4827c949919f88f0edf473a07f/election-2025-55203.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:57:56.871832

On Day 1 of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy canceled billions of dollars for Biden-era climate and energy projects. They say that the projects are wasteful. But as Colorado Public Radio's Ishan Thakore reports, recipients say the cuts are shortsighted.

HANK PRICE: Go ahead and walk out here.

ISHAN THAKORE, BYLINE: Yeah.

PRICE: It's more interesting once we get out...

THAKORE: In a grassy field near the Denver Airport, Hank Price is showing off a massive, roughly three-story collection of curved mirrors. It's called the SunBeam, and it's a demo for a technology called concentrating solar power.

PRICE: This is a low-cost way of making solar power at night.

THAKORE: Price says the SunBeam is different from your average solar farm. It uses the sun to generate heat, which can be stored to make electricity later, even after dark.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

What's the item?

Electricity

How has the price changed since before the pandemic?

Electricity prices have jumped 40% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a bigger jump than the 26% increase in the overall cost of living.

Why have prices gone up?

Demand for electricity has increased in recent years, partly because of all of the new data centers that are popping up to serve the artificial intelligence boom. Some old power plants have been retired, and utilities are scrambling to add new electric generation, while also making the power grid more resilient. Also, the price of natural gas used to generate electricity has increased.

Now that fall is here, Kathy Letourneau no longer has to run her air conditioner around the clock. But the Fort Walton Beach, Fla., resident also relies on electric heat to stay warm in the winter. Letourneau, who is 71, says her power bills run between $200 and $300 a month, all year round.

""When you're living on a fixed income, you feel it,"" she says. ""There have been a few times we couldn't afford it. We've had our lights turned off before.""

Residential electric rates in Florida have jumped more than 13% over the last year, according to the Energy Department. Letourneau and her husband are bracing for another increase next year.

""Florida is a lot of retired people on Social Security,"" Letourneau says. ""I mean, it's hard.""

Across the country, residential electric rates are climbing twice as fast as the overall rate of inflation. The high price of power became a flash point in this week's elections in both New Jersey and Virginia.

The rising costs are partly driven by the price of natural gas, used to generate electricity. Natural gas prices fluctuate with the weather and with the level of gas exports, which have been climbing.

Electricity demand has also soared

Electric bills are also going up because of increased power demand.

For the first two decades of this century, demand for electricity barely budged. But in the last few years, people and businesses have been plugging in more and more. The Energy Department expects demand to grow 2.2% this year and 2.4% next year.

""There's automobiles that have gone from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles,"" says Drew Maloney, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents power companies around the country. ""You're also seeing stoves being replaced from gas to electric. And the AI data center growth.""

Utilities are hustling to meet that demand by replacing old power plants that have gone out of service while adding new generating capacity from wind, solar, and natural gas.

""We support developing all energy sources,"" Maloney says. ""We need as many electrons on the grid as possible to help keep the grid reliable and costs low.""

Who pays for the electricity needed for AI?

Utilities say building new power supplies along with a more resilient electric grid will cost more than a trillion dollars over the next five years. The question facing regulators is, who's going to pay for that.

In theory, the new data centers springing up to support the artificial intelligence boom should cover their own power costs and at least a bit more, potentially lowering bills for nearby residential customers.

""That doesn't seem that hard to do,"" says Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at U.C. Berkeley's Haas School of Business. ""But you'd be surprised how many politicians and regulators say, 'Well, this is an economic development opportunity. We should give them a great rate.' And in their enthusiasm, they'll end up charging rates that don't even cover the incremental cost.""

If data centers are given a break on prices, residential customers could end up saddled with some of their costs. Across the country, residential customers typically pay higher rates than commercial or industrial power users, according to the Energy Department.

There are ways to reduce the nation's overall power bill, by adjusting when and where electricity is consumed. By far, the most expensive time to use power is when demand is at its peak — typically on the hottest days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.

""If you could get these data centers to get off the grid, say 50-60 hours a year, they really wouldn't create any cost pressure at all,"" Borenstein says.

Data centers could do that by temporarily switching to backup power, or re-routing their data traffic to cooler parts of the country. Borenstein suggests regulators could require that. Electric vehicle owners also have considerable flexibility in deciding when to plug in and charge.

While demand for electricity is growing faster now than it was a few years ago, that increase is hardly unprecedented. Borenstein says electric demand grew more than twice as fast in the 1960s. That's when air conditioning was going mainstream, making it comfortable for retirees like Letourneau to live in places like Florida.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F9b%2F3517d5ed49fea5d530213006377b%2Fcost-of-living-electricity.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:57:59.782445

Rejected MIECO’s argument that Pioneer’s failure to purchase replacement gas was merely an economic hardship rather than a force majeure event.7 The court held that the contract’s plain language and industry practices supported Pioneer’s position.
Courts interpret force majeure using an impracticability standard rather than requiring impossibility.

MIECO claimed breach of contract when Pioneer failed to deliver the agreed amount of natural gas from February 14 to February 19, 2021, during Winter Storm Uri, arguing that the storm was not a force majeure event since Pioneer could have purchased replacement gas from the spot market.

The Texas Northern District Court, in denying MIECO’s motion for summary judgment, held that force majeure provisions in the contract were unambiguous and that Pioneer’s non-delivery from February 14 to February 19, 2021, caused by low temperatures that affected an entire geographic region and caused freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe, constituted force majeure under the contract.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit in MIECO, L.L.C., v. Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.2 held that the district court correctly interpreted force majeure in that it did not require Pioneer to show that the storm rendered its performance under the contract literally impossible. However, the appellate court remanded the case for fact-finding on whether (1) Winter Storm Uri prevented Pioneer’s performance and (2) Pioneer exercised due diligence. The district court’s recent opinion on remand closes the loop.

On October 15, 2025, Judge Jane J. Boyle issued a memorandum opinion3 in favor of Pioneer, holding that the producer did not breach its firm gas delivery contract with MIECO during Winter Storm Uri. The court, in its opinion:

Reaffirmed that Winter Storm Uri qualified as a force majeure event under the contract because it was a weather-related occurrence affecting an entire geographic region, which caused well and pipeline failures.4 The court found that Pioneer’s performance was “prevented” within the meaning of the contract because the storm rendered full performance impracticable, and that a finding of impossibility was not necessary.

Found that Pioneer exercised due diligence by winterizing equipment, reallocating firm volumes, and working to restore production as soon as conditions allowed.5 The court also credited expert testimony that, under industry customs and practice, a producer who has lost its gas supply due to force majeure is not expected to purchase replacement gas on the spot market.6 This custom exists to avoid further driving up spot market prices to allow producers to focus on restoring supply, which benefits the market as a whole.

Rejected MIECO’s argument that Pioneer’s failure to purchase replacement gas was merely an economic hardship rather than a force majeure event.7 The court held that the contract’s plain language and industry practices supported Pioneer’s position. The court also found that MIECO had, in other contracts, negotiated for special language requiring sellers to procure replacement gas, but had not done so in contracts with Pioneer.8

The MIECO decision adds to a growing line of cases interpreting force majeure provisions under the NAESB. Together with opinions such as LNG Americas v. Chevron Natural Gas9 and Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corp. v. BP Energy,10 the ruling underscores several consistent themes:

Severe regional weather events can qualify as a force majeure event under the NAESB.

Courts interpret force majeure using an impracticability standard rather than requiring impossibility.

A producer invoking force majeure is not required to procure replacement gas or draw from storage at the delivery point when disruption arises from loss of its upstream supply if not specifically required by the contract.

Industry customs and the parties’ course of dealing are relevant to interpreting force majeure obligations, but the contract’s language is paramount.

Precise contract drafting is vital. If buyers want sellers to procure replacement gas during force majeure events, they must include explicit language.

Though she majored in sociology, that interest never went away. So, in August, she took her first Detroit Documenters training. Since then, she’s documented two public meetings — Detroit City Council and Detroit Housing Commission (DHC).

Aqsa, 25, splits her time between Washington, D.C., and Detroit, working for an advocacy nonprofit as a community organizer.

She’s not new to city council meetings in general but has been impressed by the amount of public participation at Detroit City Council meetings.

“I don’t think everyone is aware of how important that is, showing up locally,” Aqsa said. She loves to see residents get involved and wants to do more of that herself.

The DHC meeting she documented was tougher because there was a lot of technical language, she said, adding that doing more research beforehand would’ve helped her decipher parts of the discussion. The highlight of that meeting for her was still public comments.

Aqsa graduated from American University with a desire to better understand how theories she studied show up in the real world. She wants to continue observing differences between spaces for organizing and public engagement in metro Washington, D.C., versus the Midwest. Detroit, she said, has “more of an ability to engage local residents.”

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.","ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) announced the contracted sales of its remaining Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits for 2025 from its Gevo North Dakota facility (“GevoND”), totaling $30 million, to Stifel Financial Corp. and Capital Community Bank, bringing the total sales for 2025 to $52 million, when combined with the previously announced $22 million worth of credits sold in July. These production tax credits were generated based on volumes of ethanol produced at GevoND and taking into account operating carbon sequestration and operating efficiencies. Gevo believes it is one of the first ethanol producer to sell Section 45Z credits directly to tax credit purchasers.

Section 45Z, also known as the Clean Fuel Production Credit, is a federal incentive designed to support domestic biofuel production and agriculture. Initially enacted in 2022, the credit was extended through 2029 under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“The amount of production tax credits we generate is determined by the volume of ethanol produced that satisfies the Section 45Z requirements,” said Dr. Paul D. Bloom, chief business officer at Gevo. “The cash from these sales enables reinvestment in our ethanol and carbon businesses to improve throughput, expand margins, and increase production of fuel and feed co-products, and to develop voluntary carbon markets—all while supporting U.S. corn growers.”

“Our Section 45Z tax credit sale continues to be backed by a tax insurance policy that mitigates much of the residual risk for buyers in credit transfers, which we view as low risk to begin with,” said Leke Agiri, chief financial officer of Gevo. “We’d like to thank our buyers and transaction participants in working with us to achieve this milestone. We expect this to greatly enhance our cash flow from operations, and we expect it will be reoccuring. We are really proud of these deals.”

Would you pick the new F-150 Lightning STX over a Tesla Cybertruck, or do you think the Cybertruck still has the edge?","Ford saw that it had a winner with its F-150 Lightning and increased its investment by introducing the 2026 F-150 Lightning STX. This new version of its electric pickup truck replaces the outgoing XLT trim. The STX offers a combination of better performance, longer range, and added features without any increase in price, making it an appealing choice for buyers looking for value in a full-size electric truck from a proven brand.

This value and familiarity are driving many consumers to choose the Ford F-150 Lightning over the Tesla Cybertruck, which for many can seem too unusual or experimental. The Lightning looks and drives like a traditional truck while offering modern electric power and advanced features like vehicle-to-home (V2H) backup energy. The Lightning is easier to service through Ford’s wide dealer network.

The Lightning’s success hasn’t been overlooked on social media where recent owners are heaping praise. On Reddit, LordOfBadaBing posted “One Month with the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning ER”:

“I bought an extended range 131 kWh battery rated for 320 miles at full charge. We’re getting 2.4 mi/kWh which is right up to spec, and pay $0.29 per kWh peak and $0.19 per kWh off peak incentive through energy provider.

What do I like? Everything! Simply put this is the best vehicle I’ve ever driven. Most comfortable. Most fun. Most advanced. Surprisingly among the easiest to drive (on par with our standard ICE SUV and way easier than a Suburban we recently rented). Any concern I had about driving an EV before the Lightning are long gone.

Range for an EV, let alone a 7,000-pound vehicle, is incredible.

Kids have their iPad/Switch/laptop plugged in and running in the back — keeps everyone quiet (although they do fight over the heated seats because the middle of the bench isn’t heated). We watched some YouTube on the huge center display while parked. I used the workstation feature to take a work call while the electrician had to cut power to the house installing the L2.

Showed off the frunk cooler for a mini tailgate party (though without a plug, once the ice melted it wasn’t much of a cooler anymore. It lasted about five hours on an 80-degree day after a 60 min drive). Added a tonneau tri-fold cover and bed mat.”

On another long Reddit thread, the F-150 Lightning compliments keep rolling with Ftbldude322 commenting:

“Mine has been flawless too. A 23 XLT with all the options. Over 21k miles now and it’s the most well built vehicle I’ve ever had. Zero flaws that I’ve found. No squeaks or rattles. Love it so much.”

jayk82 responded with a comment about media bias:

“I've read a lot of the horror stories here, but I've had mine for 11 months and 23k miles and it's been flawless. I can't imagine having a different vehicle.”

Performance and Range Improvements

The F-150 Lightning STX comes standard with a 123-kWh battery, matching the Tesla Cybertruck in capacity. The new pack delivers an EPA-estimated range of 290 miles, about 50 miles more than the XLT’s smaller 98-kWh pack. Dual electric motors now produce 536 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque, offering a noticeable performance boost while maintaining all-wheel drive and an e-locking differential for added traction.

Design and Features

On the outside, the STX distinguishes itself with a black grille accented in Grabber Blue, STX decals, unique emblems, and rugged black wheels with all-terrain tires. It also borrows off-road running boards from the gas-powered Tremor model. Inside, Ford opted for cloth upholstery with embroidered Lightning STX logos, a heated steering wheel, and an optional easy-clean vinyl floor. New paint colors include Argon Blue, Marsh Gray, and Ruby Red Metallic.

Value Pricing

Despite all these upgrades, Ford has kept the MSRP at $63,000 which is identical to the previous XLT trim. That pricing positions the Lightning STX as one of the strongest value propositions in Ford’s EV lineup, making the switch from gas to electric even more appealing.

Future Ford EV Strategy

Ford is also working on a new universal electric vehicle platform aimed at affordability and efficiency. The company claims future models will be up to 40% faster to build, helping reduce costs. By 2027, Ford expects to launch a midsize electric pickup that will be similar in size to the Ranger, and starting around $30,000. This signals Ford’s commitment to making electric trucks accessible to a wider audience while pushing manufacturing innovation.

Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid Capability

The Sigenergy bidirectional charger, when paired with a Ford F-150 Lightning, enables both vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionality. This setup allows the F-150 Lightning’s large battery, which can be as big as 131 kWh, to send power back to the grid. It can help stabilize the grid, allow owners to earn money by selling electricity, or provide backup power for a home or even a small factory.

Sigenergy’s offering for the F-150 Lightning is a bidirectional charging system called SigenStor that allows the vehicle to both charge and supply power for vehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. This system is a smart charger that can automatically charge the truck during off-peak hours. It’s an all-in-one home energy management system which integrates a solar inverter, EV DC charger, battery power conversion system (PCS), battery pack, and energy management system (EMS). Its modular design allows for scalability, with stackable battery modules and the ability to mix old and new batteries. The system is designed to lower utility bills and increase energy independence through smart, AI-powered management and features vehicle-to-home/grid (V2X) capabilities for EV charging.

The setup also has strong potential for remote or off-grid work. Instead of relying on portable diesel generators or standalone battery packs, construction crews can use the F-150 Lightning to power a job site for the day. Afterward, they simply recharge the truck overnight and are ready to go again the next morning.

Bottom Line

The F-150 Lightning STX represents a smart evolution in Ford’s EV strategy, offering more range and power for the same price while hinting at a broader push toward affordability and efficiency in future models. With tax credits still available and a strong value equation, the STX could easily become Ford’s most compelling electric truck yet.

Together with the SIG Energy charger, the Ford F-150 Lightning demonstrates how electric vehicles can go far beyond transportation. They offer resilience for homes, flexibility for businesses, and mobility for worksites, making a powerful case for how EVs can function as both vehicles and energy tools.

What Do You Think?

Would you pick the new F-150 Lightning STX over a Tesla Cybertruck, or do you think the Cybertruck still has the edge?

Does Ford’s decision to add range and power without raising the price make the Lightning STX the best value electric truck right now?

In May, EPA officials announced at a staff meeting that Energy Star would be “eliminated.” The backlash was swift.
When industry argued that the Energy Star label helps them sell appliances, Zelden appears to have listened.
“Energy star is an American success story,” said Symons.
High energy costs were also a theme of gubernatorial races inNew Jersey and Virginia.","It has been a big week in energy news, with several resounding wins for efficiency advocates.

On Tuesday, voters in Georgia flipped two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities and sets rates. They installed a pair of Democrats on this little known, yet powerful, body for the first time in nearly two decades. Further north, Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey handily won after making rising energy prices a centerpiece of their campaigns. The victories came just a few days after The New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency is quietly reconsidering plans to eliminate the popular Energy Star program.

Taken together, these developments suggest that energy costs could be moving the political needle in ways that other issues, like climate change, have not. And, with next year’s midterms on the horizon, it’s an issue both political parties will increasingly have to grapple with.

“When the costs of climate change become evident, there’s a political necessity to find policy that works,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who represented South Carolina and has become a leading conservative voice on climate change. “When people see them on their utility bills and they see them in their property tax bills, that’s when they start asking, is there any way to head this off?”

The Trump administration’s potential reversal on Energy Star is one example of the political power that energy prices can have. In May, EPA officials announced at a staff meeting that Energy Star would be “eliminated.” The backlash was swift. Within weeks, a coalition of industry groups wrote to congressional leaders in support of a program that saves Americans some $40 billion a year in utility bills. They called minimizing that financial burden “a clear priority across party lines.”

Republicans, Democrats, appliance manufacturers, and corporate giants like Home Depot lined up in defense of Energy Star and, according to the Times, the EPA is quietly backing off its plans to fully shutter the decades-long initiative, widely considered among the most successful government initiatives in modern history. Its signature blue label is now nearly as recognizable as the Nike swoosh or a Coca-Cola can.

The EPA says the future of Energy Star is still being finalized, and many of the people who work on the program have been laid off or left. But the potential walk-back is a notable change of course for a Presidential administration that has, by and large, moved to gut federal climate and environmental policies. “This is a classic Lee Zeldin leap before you look at the situation,” said Jeremy Symons, a senior advisor at the nonprofit Environmental Protection Network, about the EPA’s administrator. When industry argued that the Energy Star label helps them sell appliances, Zelden appears to have listened.

“Energy star is an American success story,” said Symons. “It’s really a no-brainer.”

Energy costs played a large role in several key political races as well, most notably in Georgia, where the campaign for public utility commission seats revolved around affordability. Republicans argued that fossil fuels offer the best route to stable and affordable power prices in the state. Democrats pointed to a string of rate increases — six in the past two years — to contend that alternatives, such as renewable energy and nuclear, are the way forward. “We need to invest in a smarter, more resilient grid that’s capable of handling the extreme weather that Georgia experiences while also expanding that access to clean energy,” then-candidate Alicia Johnson told Grist in June.

On Tuesday, Johnson and fellow democrat Peter Hubbard, who is a clean energy consultant, flipped two Republican seats by 25 point margins in a race that drew national attention and funding. The wins are the Democrats’ first statewide victories in a non-federal election since 2006.

High energy costs were also a theme of gubernatorial races inNew Jersey and Virginia. In the Garden State, Democrat Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs.” In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, also a Democrat, campaigned on a platform that included calls to expand clean energy generation and promote home weatherization to ease consumption. Despite President Trump trying to pin surging prices in those states on the Democrats, both Sherrill and Spanberger beat out Republican challengers.

In New Jersey, the local chapter of the League of Conservation Voters funded a campaign ad that attacked the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, for spiraling electricity rates. The video has 6.9 million views on YouTube and Sara Schreiber, the national organization’s senior vice president of campaigns, said internal polling showed the ad drove up Ciattarelli’s unfavorable rating among all voters by 6 percent, and a staggering 8 percent with Trump voters.

“People care about this issue, they hear what the candidates are saying, and they are siding with the candidates who are offering clean energy solutions to help lower their costs,” said Schreiber.

Dan Jasper, of the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, said it’s not surprising that framing climate as an affordability issue helps win elections. “When you say “climate,” I think that just seems too far in the future for people,” he said. “But when you put it in terms of everyday expenditures, people start to listen for sure.”

As attention turns to next year’s midterm races, election watchers say utility bills could again be a centerpiece of campaigns across the country. It’s a concern that President Donald J. Trump has already repeatedly brought up, including with promises to cut prices in half. But with energy demand on the rise for the first time in decades and prices rising twice as fast as inflation, Inglis said “I would think that Democrats should really make an issue out of that.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright acknowledged the risk in August, saying, “momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

Jesse Lee, a senior advisor with the climate-politics nonprofit Climate Power, says that the impact of rising costs is so widespread that it could become an issue almost anywhere. But he’s particularly watching states that have seen large rate increases in recent years, such as Texas, Arizona and Pennsylvania. Incumbent moderate Republicans without much a buffer could also be at risk, he said, pointing to Mike Lawler of New York as one example.

Building out the supply of clean energy in the U.S. is a clear antidote to rising demand, Lee said. While Democrats have generally embraced a path lined with renewable energy, many Republicans, including President Trump, have panned that approach.

“Anybody with eyes can see that this is a glaring vulnerability for [Republicans],” Lee said. “Democrats should be embracing it.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/election-energy-electricity-rates-prices-issue-climate.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:37.591140

One Reddit user clocked this trend in Seattle and sought local solutions on the r/Seattle subreddit.

""I've been a happy EV owner for a couple of years now. In just the past few months, I've observed cut cables (...),"" the original poster wrote.

The OP then listed eight charging station locations in the Seattle area that they had seen vandalised.

""It's creating a charging island where EV owners are forced to travel long distances just to use their vehicles … this is a problem,"" they said.

According to charging companies, per PBS, the quantity of copper in charging cables is low. Each cable, PBS said, is worth only $15 to $20 at a scrapyard.

Despite this, thieves are stealing charging cables, disrupting the lives of EV drivers, and hindering the electric movement.

Going electric, though, is a critical way for consumers to lower their carbon footprints. Polluting gases from gas-powered machines — be they cars, yard tools, or stoves — trap heat in the atmosphere.

It causes a whole slew of environmental issues, such as extreme weather events, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

Extreme weather events leave people and animals in disarray amid climate-driven wildfires, floods, and droughts.

Pollutants in the air also cause respiratory issues, including asthma attacks in children.

EVs, on the other hand, release no fumes, and the pollution from lithium battery mining does not compare to that from gas-operated appliances.

EVs also save consumers money. The cost to charge an electric vehicle is significantly lower than the cost to fuel a gas vehicle, and maintenance costs are also lower, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

A combination of an at-home charging station and solar panels can further reduce charging costs, bringing the price close to zero. EnergySage offers solar quotes to those interested.

Going electric is worth it, but something must be done about charging cable vandalism.

Commenters on the post have also noticed this trend.

Nippon Steel plans to invest $11 billion in US Steel by 2028, aiming to modernize American steelmaking—despite ongoing uncertainty around tariffs.

What does this mean?

Japan’s Nippon Steel, the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker, is leaning into its US growth strategy with a hefty $11 billion commitment over the next few years. The expansion includes a new facility in Arkansas that will introduce Nippon's advanced electrical steel sheet technology to the US market—a first meant to tap into soaring demand from the power grid and electric vehicle sectors. At the same time, upgrades planned for sites in Indiana and Pennsylvania are set to boost efficiency and output. But the aggressive push comes as the firm scales back its earnings outlook, now expecting a net loss of 60 billion yen for the year ending March 2026—down from last year’s sizable profit—largely because results from the US Steel acquisition are still pending. Tariff disruptions remain a hurdle, but Nippon Steel is banking on a steel demand comeback by 2026, while also trimming domestic operations and expanding its Indian partnership with ArcelorMittal.

Why should I care?

For markets: A measured bet on US industry’s future.

Nippon Steel’s major US commitment—even as short-term profit forecasts take a hit—shows faith in the long-term outlook for American manufacturing and infrastructure. The steel sector has been rocked by tariffs, but the company clearly sees opportunity in rising demand tied to power grid upgrades, electric vehicle expansion, and public infrastructure spending. Ultimately, how these bets unfold could ripple across wider industrial and materials markets.

The bigger picture: Global steel strategy under the microscope.

Nippon Steel’s moves in the US and India are part of a broader industry realignment as firms rethink supply chains and diversify beyond riskier home markets. Bringing leading-edge technology stateside underlines a new chapter in global industrial collaboration, at a time when governments worldwide want to boost local manufacturing.

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio.
Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.
While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.
The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031.","Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.

Now, the Trump administration has cast doubt over the future of the program — including the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2, which features projects in Ohio.

Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.

The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.

The Trump administratibon’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.

The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to ​“terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.

In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for ​“small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But ​“trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.

Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.

Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas. ​“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.

Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.

The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the ​“hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically ​“clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.

But ​“I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. ​“We would love to provide that project.”

Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.

The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/H2-hub-Millenium-Reign-Energy.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bddc879fea3ff25ffdc4117efcb40260,N,,2025-11-06 06:02:50.030129

Infrastructure: EQT has upgraded plans for a compression expansion on Mountain Valley Pipeline following strong interest in an open season.

Rigs: The US lost 5 rigs for the week ending Oct. 18, bringing the total rig count to 515.

Flows: US natural gas volumes in pipeline samples were flat W-o-W, averaging 68.6 Bcf/d for the week ending Nov. 2.

Storage: Traders expect the EIA to report a 34 Bcf injection for the week ending Nov. 24.

Infrastructure:

EQT has upgraded plans for a compression expansion on Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). The project, dubbed MVP Boost, was initially expected to add 500 MMcf/d of capacity, but the owner upsized it to 600 MMcf/d following strong interest in an open season.

In a project filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), MVP revealed that the shippers backing the expansion are Duke Energy (275 MMcf/d), Public Service Company of North Carolina (125 MMcf/d) and Virginia Power (200 MMcf/d). The companies have all signed long-term contracts at negotiated rates for the new capacity. EQT said the open season received over 1 Bcf/d of interest from potential counterparties.

The expansion will take MVP’s capacity to 2.6 Bcf/d from its current 2.0 Bcf/d and serve growing gas demand in Virginia and North Carolina. The project scope includes a new compressor station on MVP’s mainline in Montgomery County, VA and upgrades to three existing compressor stations. MVP expects to begin construction in winter 2026-27 and is targeting in-service in mid-2028.

MVP is currently flowing around 1.5 Bcf/d from West Virginia’s northern Marcellus/Utica production area to Station 165 on Transcontinental pipeline (Transco) in southern Virginia. The pipeline was placed into service in the summer of 2024 following years of legal battles. Flows on MVP have been seasonal through the first year and a half of operations, hitting peak capacity in January and February ’25 but decreasing in the spring shoulder season (see figure above).

Downstream constraints on Transco limit how much gas can currently flow on MVP, but Transco’s Southeast Supply Enhancement is expected to add 1.6 Bcf/d of additional capacity once it enters service in late 2027, alleviating those constraints.

See East Daley Analytics’ Northeast Supply & Demand Report for more information on MVP.

Rigs:

The US lost 5 rigs for the week of Oct. 18, bringing the total rig count to 515. The Permian (-5), Anadarko (-1) and Marcellus+Utica (-1) lost rigs while the Barnett (+1) and Denver-Julesburg (+1) gained rigs W-o-W.

At the company level, ET (-6), WES (-3), EPD (-2), MPLX (-1), ENLC (-1) and Hess (-1) lost rigs while PSX (+3), TRGP (+2) and M6 Midstream (+1) gained rigs W-o-W.

See East Daley Analytics’ weekly Rig Activity Tracker for more information on rigs by basin and company.

Flows:

US natural gas volumes in pipeline samples were flat W-o-W, averaging 68.6 Bcf/d for the week ending Nov. 2.

Major gas basin samples declined 0.2% W-o-W to 42.2 Bcf/d. The Haynesville sample declined 1.2% to 9.3 Bcf/d, while the Marcellus+Utica sample gained 0.3% to 32.1 Bcf/d.

Samples in liquids-focused basins increased 0.2% to 18.5 Bcf/d. The Permian sample declined 2.6% to 6.0 Bcf/d, while the Bakken sample gained 6.1% W-o-W.

Storage:

Traders and analysts expect the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to report a 34 Bcf injection for the week ending Oct. 31. An injection of 34 Bcf would increase the surplus to the five-year average by 8 Bcf to 179 Bcf. The storage surplus to last year would flip to a slight deficit of 5 Bcf from last week’s 29 Bcf surplus.

If Thursday’s EIA report comes in as expected, working gas would end the official injection season at 3,916 Bcf, or 5 Bcf greater than East Daley’s forecast in the latest Macro Supply & Demand Report. Despite storage closing at roughly the same level as last year, that is where the comparison ends between the two seasons. The 2024 shoulder period (April-October) saw 440 Bcf less gas injected. The season started with higher overall inventory, then hot weather combined with low prices to limit injections. The 2025 injection season started with relatively low inventory, but summer temperatures were not nearly as hot as the prior summer. Higher overall prices this year also induced some fuel switching and further cut into power demand.

Injections could last another week, making the week ending Nov. 14 the first net withdrawal week of the season. Prompt and cash prices have been moving in an upward direction this week as the next 15 days are expected to be colder than previously forecast.

A sunny state of 11 million people, North Carolina is a leader on utility-scale solar but middling when it comes to residential solar adoption.
The policy whiplash comes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment for rooftop solar.","A longstanding federal tax credit for rooftop solar is about to expire, making it more expensive for homeowners to access cheap, clean energy — and sowing uncertainty for the companies that put photovoltaic panels up on roofs.

But a small Durham, North Carolina, company called EnerWealth Solutions sees a path forward — at least for the next two years. Its model is to buy rooftop solar panels with a tax credit still available to commercial entities and rent them to homeowners, passing along the savings.

It’s an approach that firms around the country can adopt as the beleaguered rooftop solar sector tries to weather the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy.

The leasing strategy could be particularly useful in places like North Carolina, where a robust solar industry has taken root but state policy support for home rooftop panels is waning. In early 2023, funding dried up for a popular rooftop solar rebate program run by Duke Energy, the state’s predominant electric utility. Later that year, Duke began lowering bill credits for customers who send their solar power back to the grid.

A sunny state of 11 million people, North Carolina is a leader on utility-scale solar but middling when it comes to residential solar adoption. Just over 55,000 homes are now equipped with rooftop panels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, so the industry has ample room to grow.

“It’s so imperative that we’re opening every avenue to get these technologies into the hands of as many North Carolinians as possible,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an advocacy group.

EnerWealth’s first residential leasing customer is one of the industry’s own. A certified public accountant and financial consultant for solar firms, Casey Gilley said installing an array on his Chapel Hill home is something of an unspoken requirement. ​“You can’t work in the business and not have solar,” he said. ​“Right?”

While his profession may not be entirely typical, Gilley is an average Tar Heel in other ways. He’s trying to do his part to reduce pollution and save energy. He wants to guard against coming electricity-rate increases. And forking over a down payment on a full-price solar array for his family of five was a no-go.

Plenty of people EnerWealth aims to serve fit that profile, says Brian Liechti, director of solar leasing. That’s why, until the end of 2027, when companies like his can no longer access the tax credit, the goal is simple: ​“Make hay and electrons while the sun shines,” he said.

Silver linings for an embattled industry

Veterans of the solar industry say they’re used to the ebb and flow of policies designed to encourage homeowners to go solar. But there’s no doubt that they’ve had an especially hard year.

Most crushing was the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress in July. The law eliminates the 30% tax credit for home solar at the end of this year, nearly a decade sooner than it was previously set to expire. The change is pushing sales to new heights, but a crash is expected once the incentive is gone in 2026.

The White House also clawed back $7 billion in grants intended to help low-income households go solar, including a $156 million initiative projected to benefit 12,000 families across North Carolina. The state’s Attorney General Jeff Jackson is among 23 attorneys general around the country suing the Trump administration for terminating the program, calling the move illegal.

The policy whiplash comes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment for rooftop solar. High interest rates and inflation have lingered for years, dampening interest in the sector among those without the cash to buy a solar array outright.

Despite these woes, North Carolina installers see a few bright spots.

For one, a Duke trial program called PowerPair, in which customers receive a rebate of up to $9,000 for investing in a battery along with a solar array, has seen thousands of enrollees since its launch in the spring of last year. The pilot has reached its limit in the company’s eastern and far western territory but still has room in the central part of the state.

What’s more, a 2017 state law creates a small crack in Duke’s monopoly. While agreements between homeowners and non-utilities for the purchase of electricity are forbidden as ever, the statute allows individuals to rent the use of solar equipment up to a certain cap. This provision has been little-used to date in the residential sector but is a cornerstone of the EnerWealth model.

Then, there’s a final puzzle piece for the company: the pro-solar policy that escaped the purge in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While incentives for individuals dry up Dec. 31, commercial entities can receive at least a 30% credit for investing in renewable energy through the end of 2027.

EnerWealth, then, can keep buying rooftop solar panels for another two-plus years, benefit from the credit, and then pass on some of the savings to its lessees. For now, the company doesn’t have to fear hitting the Duke solar leasing cap established in 2017. And customers who can cash in on the PowerPair battery incentive while it still lasts will see even more savings.

“One tool in the toolbox”

These federal and state incentives can come together to produce savings for North Carolinians, even in a tough time for rooftop solar.

Though Gilley might conceivably have borrowed money and installed his panels in time to use the expiring tax credit, he chose the EnerWealth lease model instead.

“I ran the numbers of ownership versus lease, and they were very similar,” he said. But what ultimately tipped the scales toward the latter was that it didn’t require a down payment or any ongoing costs. ​“I didn’t have to come up with any cash,” he said. ​“Also, I don’t have to worry about any maintenance or any problems for the next 25 years.”

PowerPair is still available in Gilley’s area, so he used the $9,000 rebate as a down payment on the battery and the solar system. He receives net-metering bill credits and still pays Duke for electricity — but about $210 less per month than before. Even with his $150 monthly payment to EnerWealth, Gilley is saving about $60 a month.

His rental payment for the equipment will step up 1.5% each year. ​“But electricity prices are going to escalate at a much higher pace than that,” he predicted. ​“So, my annual savings will only grow.”

When the residential tax credit expires in two months, homeowners who want to go solar will have an even easier choice to make: Finance their equipment over time at roughly 7% interest rates or rent it for about 25% less per year, thanks to passthrough savings from the tax credits.

According to EnerWealth calculations, the lower lease payments on a $35,000 battery and solar array mean customers will save nearly $15,000 in overall electricity costs over 20 years. Even those who can pay for a system outright might choose a rental option: It’s cheaper because the lessor gets the government incentive.

“A lease is the only way to monetize the tax credit for residential systems,” EnerWealth’s Liechti said.

Meanwhile, in terms of customer experience, there’s little difference between renting and owning the panels and battery. Homeowners have a buyout option beginning in year seven. If they move, they can purchase the equipment and include the expense in the home’s sale price, or transfer the lease — and monthly bill savings — to the new owners.

The EnerWealth model does have its limits. It’s only available in Duke territory, which covers most but not all of the state. It’s also much more attractive with the PowerPair rebate, which is soon to dry up and faces an uncertain future after that.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1379397562.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1b6791e45cad394369cf9b8dfabfe3c2,N,,2025-11-06 04:17:54.806957

The rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution found that climate change increased Melissa’s maximum wind speeds by 7% and made the rainfall 16% more intense.
The scientists also wrote that the temperature and humidity in which the storm intensified were made six times more likely due to climate change compared to a pre-industrial world.
Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to human-caused climate change.
“It’s like basically taking a sponge and wringing it out, and climate change is making that sponge even larger,” said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany.","Human-caused climate change boosted the destructive winds and rain unleashed by Hurricane Melissa and increased the temperatures and humidity that fueled the storm, according to an analysis released Thursday.

Melissa was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall and brought destructive weather to Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba, causing dozens of deaths across the Caribbean. Roofs were torn off of homes, hospitals were damaged, roads were blocked by landslides and crop fields were ruined.

The rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution found that climate change increased Melissa’s maximum wind speeds by 7% and made the rainfall 16% more intense. The scientists also wrote that the temperature and humidity in which the storm intensified were made six times more likely due to climate change compared to a pre-industrial world.

Rapid attribution analyses are a type of research that study factors influencing an extreme weather event and explore what the event would have been like in a world without climate change. They are typically published days or weeks after an extreme weather event.

Melissa slowly tracked across the region and drew in enormous amounts of energy from abnormally warm ocean water. The analysis reported ocean temperatures in Melissa’s path through the Caribbean were about 1.4°C (2.5°F) warmer compared to a pre-industrial climate.

“Warmer ocean temperatures are effectively the engine that drives a hurricane … the warmer the ocean temperatures, the greater the wind speed a hurricane can have,” said Theodore Keeping, a climate scientist who works for WWA and contributed to the analysis.

Melissa is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification, which is when a tropical cyclone’s maximum sustained winds increase by at least 30 knots (about 35 mph or 56 kph) in 24 hours.

“A hurricane this rare would actually have had wind speeds about 10 mph (16 kph) less extreme” in a pre-industrial climate, said Keeping. He said research links hurricane wind speeds to economic damage and there would have been less destruction caused by Melissa if the winds were slower.

Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to human-caused climate change. Planet-warming gases released by humans, such as carbon dioxide, cause the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and increase ocean temperatures. Warmer oceans give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.

“It’s like basically taking a sponge and wringing it out, and climate change is making that sponge even larger,” said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany.

Tang, who was not involved in the WWA research, said the methodology of the study released Thursday seems robust, and one of the more novel aspects of the analysis was the connection the scientists drew between wind speeds and increase in damage, which he said is a challenging area of research.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, who was not involved in the WWA research, said the findings of the rapid analysis are in line with existing research about climate change and tropical storms in the Atlantic. “This is completely consistent with our expectation of what’s going to happen in the future,” Dessler said.

Rapid attribution analyses help fill the need for an explanation about the influence of climate change shortly after a catastrophic weather event occurs, said Dessler. He said such analyses are “very valuable as a quick look” before the scientists are able to do more time-consuming calculations.

Dessler said one of the scariest aspects of Melissa was the storm’s peak sustained winds of 185 mph (298 kph) winds. “That’s pretty rare to have a storm that strong. And I think that, to the extent that this is a harbinger of the future, it’s not good,” he said.

On Day 1 of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy canceled billions of dollars for Biden-era climate and energy projects. They say that the projects are wasteful. But as Colorado Public Radio's Ishan Thakore reports, recipients say the cuts are shortsighted.

HANK PRICE: Go ahead and walk out here.

ISHAN THAKORE, BYLINE: Yeah.

PRICE: It's more interesting once we get out...

THAKORE: In a grassy field near the Denver Airport, Hank Price is showing off a massive, roughly three-story collection of curved mirrors. It's called the SunBeam, and it's a demo for a technology called concentrating solar power.

PRICE: This is a low-cost way of making solar power at night.

THAKORE: Price says the SunBeam is different from your average solar farm. It uses the sun to generate heat, which can be stored to make electricity later, even after dark.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

The proposed legislation, sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North) seeks to establish a national framework for the transition to electric vehicles, encourage local manufacturing, and strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

During Tuesday’s plenary, lawmakers overwhelmingly supported the bill, describing it as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

Senator Kalu said the legislation aims to transform Nigeria’s automotive and energy sectors, foster innovation, and create jobs throughout the manufacturing value chain.

According to the draft, the law will provide incentives including tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for both electric vehicle users and investors.

It will also make it mandatory for all fuel stations nationwide to install electric vehicle charging points.

The bill further requires foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

Companies must source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030. Violations could attract fines of up to 250 million naira per breach, while unlicensed importers risk penalties of 500 million naira and confiscation of goods.

The bill positions Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicle production in Africa. It mandates that local assemblers produce a minimum of 5,000 units annually, meeting international safety and technical standards.

Investors who establish charging infrastructure will also qualify for government grants and tax credits.

Meanwhile senate president Godswill Akpabio described the proposal as forward-looking legislation that supports President Bola Tinubu’s economic diversification and clean energy goals.

“This is a necessary shift that reflects the future of transportation and sustainability,” he said.

The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Industry for further legislative work and is expected to return to the chamber within four weeks for third reading and final passage.

Revolutionizing Battery Manufacturing

UK-based battery tech startup Anaphite has announced the results of an independent assessment confirming that its dry coating technology for lithium-ion electrodes can significantly cut carbon emissions in battery production.

The study, conducted by Minviro, a life cycle assessment (LCA) specialist, found that Anaphite’s process reduces emissions by 3.57 kg CO₂ per kWh of battery capacity compared to conventional wet coating — a method still used for over 99% of batteries produced globally.

If adopted industry-wide, the technology could help save 7 million tonnes of CO₂ annually — equivalent to the carbon captured by 320 million trees.

Why Dry Coating Matters

Battery electrodes are typically made using a wet coating process that requires enormous ovens to dry solvent-based slurries — consuming vast amounts of energy and releasing significant emissions.

Anaphite’s dry coating process eliminates this energy-intensive drying stage. Instead, it uses a single engineered powder material that integrates all the necessary components of an electrode, optimized for high-speed manufacturing lines.

The result is a cleaner, more cost-efficient method of producing electrodes, one that can help battery and EV manufacturers cut carbon footprints while preparing for stricter regulations.

A Step Toward EU Battery Passport Compliance

From 2027, the EU’s Battery Passport regulations will require every EV and industrial battery over 2 kWh to disclose its total carbon footprint through an ISO-compliant life cycle assessment.

Using Anaphite’s dry coating method could help manufacturers stay ahead of these requirements.

For example, a 75 kWh EV battery pack made with this process could save around 268 kg of CO₂ compared to traditional manufacturing.

Although specific emission thresholds have not yet been set, such reductions could soon become essential for market access in Europe — and potentially a competitive edge for forward-thinking OEMs.

Expert Insights and Validation

The Minviro assessment adhered to ISO 14067 standards and was critically reviewed by independent experts in life cycle analysis and battery production.

According to Lydia Bridges, Senior Consultant at Minviro, the project demonstrates how transparent environmental assessments can translate innovation into measurable impact:

“Our independent analysis identified a clear reduction in carbon footprint for Anaphite’s dry coating process compared with conventional wet coating. Studies like this provide essential environmental data for cell manufacturers as they prepare for EU Battery Regulation compliance.”

The study was part of a Feasibility Study project supported by the UK Government’s Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF), facilitated by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC).

These government-backed initiatives aim to support next-generation technologies that could make the UK a leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.

Looking Ahead

As global battery demand is expected to exceed 1.9 TWh by 2025 and nearly double by 2030, innovations like Anaphite’s could play a crucial role in decarbonizing the e-mobility supply chain.

Dry coating isn’t just about reducing emissions, it represents a broader shift toward cleaner, faster, and more efficient manufacturing methods that could define the next decade of EV production.

Premium Subscriber Q&A: Jamieson expounds on how the role of in-house counsel has changed over her three decades working in legal departments.
“When she first started, she hit the ground running and quickly understood the various existing legal challenges and issues that OCI faced.
Austin-headquartered Topaz Power Management hired Jamieson in 2012 as its general counsel — a position she held for more than eight years.
Throughout the Covid pandemic, Jamieson worked as a freelance legal consultant, providing legal and advisory services to a handful of energy companies.","As the world exited the isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, Janet Jamieson and her husband “were ready for an adventure.”

Jamieson had been a general counsel and senior counsel at three conventionally fired power plants for more than two decades. Then, she received a call from a legal recruiter with an opportunity that, she says, “fit the bill in a number of ways.”

OCI Enterprise’s emphasis on renewable energy and related manufacturing attracted Jamieson right away.

“Renewable technology, especially solar, and its cousin, battery energy storage systems, are incredible technologies that have much to offer in terms of enhancing grid stability as well as, of course, in terms of protecting the environment and limiting harmful emissions, which is important to me,” she told The Texas Lawbook.

Two years into her job as OCI’s general counsel, the new administration and Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which introduced sweeping changes that directly affected OCI’s businesses.

“The legislation adjusted tax credits for renewable projects, added restrictions on foreign investment and created new compliance obligations,” said Jessica Adkins, a partner at Sidley Austin. “These changes came at a time when energy companies were already contending with global trade restrictions and supply chain pressures.”

“Janet played a central role in ensuring OCI not only complied with the new requirements but also used them as an opportunity to strengthen the company’s market position,” Adkins said. “She has also advised OCI’s Korean parent company on U.S. investment structures, guided cross-border transactions through tightened foreign investment framework and developed strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs on polysilicon-related products.”

“Her ability to see both the legal and commercial implications of these changes has enabled OCI to continue closing high-value transactions while positioning itself as a leader in clean energy,” said Adkins, who nominated Jamieson for the 2025 San Antonio Corporate Counsel Award for General Counsel of the Year for a Small Legal Department (two to five lawyers).

The Association of Corporate Counsel’s San Antonio Chapter and The Lawbook agree with Adkins and are honoring Jamieson with the award this Thursday, Nov. 6.

Premium Subscriber Q&A: Jamieson expounds on how the role of in-house counsel has changed over her three decades working in legal departments.

“Janet has been able to guide the company with a steady hand through significant changes in the industry, the economy and OCI’s projects,” said Andrew Wong, a partner at ArentFox Schiff. “When she first started, she hit the ground running and quickly understood the various existing legal challenges and issues that OCI faced. She was able to lead her team and the business as it dealt with many of these issues, and as the company explored and transitioned into new projects and areas.”

“Despite a lean team, she has been instrumental in sustaining OCI’s success and increasing OCI’s presence in the industry and the area,” Wong said.

Mario Samos, a senior managing associate at Sidley Austin in Houston, said Jamieson “has strengthened OCI’s ability to execute deals with speed and confidence.”

“One of Janet’s important achievements has been improving the company’s transaction processes, including by assessing and refining the forms of agreements used across deals and the processes used to review and negotiate transactions,” Samos said. “This work has given OCI the flexibility to take advantage of commercial opportunities quickly while still maintaining clear frameworks for addressing issues that might arise in a transaction.”

“Beyond process, Janet’s success has been in how she has shaped the relationship between the legal and commercial teams,” Samos said. “She has built a culture of partnership and mutual understanding. In the transactions in which we have worked on together, she has successfully been able to ensure that the legal function does not just advise on risks but also actively drives business success.”

The accomplishments of Jamieson and her team of three other lawyers in 2024 and 2025 seem to accumulate monthly. They include:

· Navigated and structured transactions under new foreign investment rules;

· Mitigated trade restrictions and tariffs and developed strategies to address ongoing antidumping and countervailing duties and polysilicon related tariffs, safeguarding OCI’s renewable energy and manufacturing businesses;

· Closed more than 1 gigawatts of solar project sales in Texas;

· Advanced energy storage and power agreements and negotiated a long-term agreement with CPS Energy for services from OCI Energy’s Alamo City battery project, strengthening San Antonio’s grid resilience;

· Strengthened domestic solar manufacturing and supported Mission Solar Energy’s 2024 nationwide launch of a tariff-free, domestically sourced, utility-scale product line that aligns with new sourcing rules, enhancing America’s renewable supply chain; and

· Counseled OCI Alabama’s state-of-the-art chemical facility and provided legal oversight on operational, environmental and regulatory issues critical to the company’s advanced sodium percarbonate manufacturing operations.

“There is no consistent routine from one day to the next,” Jamieson said. “Every day is different. Executive leadership spends a fair amount of time discussing the strategic direction of all our U.S. subsidiaries — one of which is a developer of utility scale solar farms, another of which is a chemical manufacturer, and the third of which is in the solar module business.”

Jamieson said she works on financings, engages in transaction structuring discussions, provides input on major agreements, provides guidance on HR-related matters, manages contract disputes and interacts with OCI’s Asian-based affiliates on trade or regulatory matters.

“My time tends to be very taken up by others during the day, so I often use evenings or the mornings to catch up on drafting and reviewing documents,” she said. “I also take time each day to catch up on general and industry news, particularly given the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and changing tariff and trade-case environment.”

Jamieson grew up in Colorado Springs and enjoyed hiking and skiing with her parents and older brother. Her mother was an elementary school teacher, and her father owned a small construction company.

“I had always been interested in the law, given my affinity for logic and language, not to mention that, when my brother and I were kids, he would often jokingly tell me when we argued that I’d make a good lawyer someday,” she said.

Jamieson earned her undergraduate degree at Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1987 and then a master’s degree in 1989 at Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey.

“I found myself somewhat adrift as to where my new path would lead,” she said. “On a whim, really, I applied for a job to be — of all things — a natural gas marketer for a company in Denver. My customers were quite diverse and all in New Mexico, ranging from farmers to large hotels to hospitals. The famers were my favorite. It was my first exposure to negotiating contracts, which I enjoyed. Later, that company was acquired by an affiliate of then-LG&E Energy Marketing.”

The idea of law school resurfaced in the early 1990s, and she was admitted to the University of Colorado School of Law.

When she informed her employer, company leaders suggested that she take a leave of absence instead of resigning, which would allow her to work during holidays and summer breaks. She agreed.

“I hadn’t planned on staying in the energy industry when I was accepted to law school,” she said. “The company continued to offer me opportunities throughout law school, including transitioning me to legal-related work with their commercial and regulatory attorneys.”

When Jamieson graduated in 1996, LG&E hired her directly into its legal department to work with and support their senior attorneys in Dallas.

“It’s actually very unusual for companies to hire attorneys directly out of law school, but mine was a smooth transition, given my industry background and the fact the company had a large enough legal department so there were a number of senior attorneys to train me,” she said.

In 1999, Houston-based GenOn Energy, which is now part of NRG, hired Jamieson as its senior counsel handling complex power sales agreements, credit support agreements, tolling agreements and overseeing finance and compliance matters.

Austin-headquartered Topaz Power Management hired Jamieson in 2012 as its general counsel — a position she held for more than eight years.

Throughout the Covid pandemic, Jamieson worked as a freelance legal consultant, providing legal and advisory services to a handful of energy companies.

As the world reopened and returned to normal in 2022, Jamieson and her husband, who retired from a long career at Canadian National Railway, started thinking about the future.

“Neither of us had a specific vision [of] what that would look like,” she said.

Then came the call about OCI.

The emphasis on renewable energy was an attraction, Jamieson said, but so was the “fabulous group of diverse people” at OCI’s helm, which included leaders from Korea, South Africa, Turkey and Australia.

“Like a lot of attorneys practicing in the renewables sector, I began my energy career working with conventional-fired power generation facilities,” she said.

The move also provided Jamieson and her husband the opportunity for some lifestyle changes.

“When we moved to San Antonio, instead of living outside the city as we did in Austin, we ‘shook it up’ and chose a flat downtown near the river, where we frequently walk to restaurants or to get a coffee on weekends,” she said. “We’ve enjoyed being at the heart of San Antonio, its diversity and its celebrations, including Fiesta, which I’d never heard of before moving here but now look forward to each spring.”

The OCI position has come with challenges, such as the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But lawyers agree that she has successfully handled each one of them.

“The changes in renewables- and tax-related legislation have presented significant challenges for renewables and related manufacturing in the United States,” she said. “Also, I had never worked for a foreign-controlled company, and I was not versed in Asian/Korean law and culture. Suffice to say, there is a different tempo and business culture, which I’m still learning but enjoy.”

“One of the super fun things about being in-house is having the opportunity to work closely with the commercial folks — not just at the end to document a transaction — but rather to participate and assist in the structuring of that transaction from its early stages,” Jamieson said. “I appreciate the collaborative environment throughout the organization. Respectful communication is key in that it facilitates the exchange of ideas so they can be evaluated and built on. Part of that is we have to listen, truly listen to each another, to make sure we understand what is being communicated.”

“While from time to time we all mess up and get hurried and perhaps don’t listen as well as we could, everyone at least tries, which is big,” she said. “It may sound cliché, but I truly believe that we are stronger as a team than as individuals.”

Samos, who has worked with Jamieson on multiple transactions, said she “is mission-focused and strategic in the work she does.”

“Janet has an exceptional ability to see both the immediate transaction and the broader organizational goals it serves, including the impact on transactions across the organization as a whole,” he said. “She is also thoughtful about resource allocation, understanding when to draw on internal legal expertise and when to bring in external counsel to achieve the best result for a transaction.”

Wong agrees and said Jamieson “is flexible and adapts easily to a variety of situations.”

“Whether it is negotiating with an opposing party, dealing with difficult counterparties or working with her team or individuals throughout her organization, Janet is able to strike the right tone and work to address any situation or issue,” he said. “She is a great listener who values the opinions of everyone on her team as well as her outside consultants and is quick to give credit to others at every opportunity. Because of this, she is able to work seamlessly with lawyers, business-side and technical folks to arrive at the best decisions and solutions for the company.”

Jamieson refers to herself as an “accidental general counsel.”

“While I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the course of my career, little of it has been self-directed, but rather much has occurred just by being open to challenges and pursuing opportunities as they came my way,” she said. “I’ve never been title or role driven. What has always been most important to me is working with smart, respectful, ethical people while doing challenging, interesting work to the best of my ability.”

(CETY) and METIS Power Inc. have partnered to introduce a mobile, modular power and mining solution designed to give cryptocurrency operators more control over where and how they source power. The integrated system pairs a mobile cryptomining solution with mobile power generation, allowing miners to deploy, relocate, and scale without relying on the local electrical grid.

The cryptomining units will be built on a trailer-based platform and arrive with racking, cooling, power distribution, and remote monitoring already in place. Operators will be able move the system to any suitable power source, including behind-the-meter sites, remote gas fields, or private power infrastructure, and begin operating shortly after arrival.

“The biggest challenges for miners continue to be power price stability and access to reliable supply,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. “Our approach should give operators the flexibility to position their mining capacity where economics make sense, whether that is grid-connected, behind-the-meter, or fully off-grid power. This solution should expand the company’s commercial footprint by generating revenue through system sales, deployment, and ongoing operational support services tied to mobile mining installations.”

The MPM-series mining unit can accommodate approximately 160 ASIC miners and is equipped with a closed-loop liquid cooling system designed to maintain steady operating performance. The companion power unit supplies on-site electrical generation so the mining operation does not depend on local grid capacity or utility interconnection timelines.

“For many operators, power is both the largest cost and the biggest operational constraint,” said Pooya Kabiri, CEO of METIS Power Inc. “By locating mining capacity directly at the power source and reducing transmission and demand charges, this approach can create conditions where delivered power cost can fall into the sub–$0.03 per kWh range, depending on fuel supply, permitting, and site configuration.”

Mr. Kabiri continued, “By combining mobile power generation with mobile compute, we’re removing those constraints entirely. Miners can now move where the energy is available, where the economics are strongest, and where operational conditions make sense, without being tied to one location or utility system.”

For operators seeking to monetize flare gas, stranded gas, or waste heat, the combined CETY–METIS mobile system will allow conversion of energy that would otherwise be wasted into productive computing output. Because the system is mobile, mining capacity can shift with market conditions, regulatory changes, or fuel availability.

The companies plan to support deployments initially in North America, with additional expansion expected in regions where behind-the-meter or off-grid power resources are accessible.

RINs sold of 12.4 million, decreased 3.3 million or 21.2% year-over-year

Our decision to sell an increased amount of our production under fixed/floor-price arrangements contributed to our having less RINs to sell in the 2025 third quarter over the 2024 third quarter. However, we have not experienced an appreciable increase in Environmental Attributes shared with our pathway providers during the third quarter of 2025. In October 2025, we filed response comments to the joint motion with the North Carolina Utility Commission (“NCUC”) requesting they grant modifications or delays only to individual power suppliers that have demonstrated need and compliance best-efforts, require power suppliers that have not achieved 100% compliance in 2025 to apply cumulatively acquired swine RECs to the suppliers unsatisfied 2025 pro rata obligation, and modify the swine RECs set-aside for 2026 and beyond to match the requirement as set by North Carolina in 2018.

The EPA indicated their intention to finalize the Supplemental Rule and the RVOs for 2025, 2026 and 2027 by the end of 2025, however, the duration of the US federal government shut down and any residual impacts on EPA staffing after the shutdown concludes may extend finalization of these items into 2026. The average D3 RIN index price for the third quarter of 2025 was $2.19 compared to $3.36 in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of approximately 34.8%. As we self-market a significant portion of our RINs, a strategic decision to not to commit to transfer available RINs during a period may impact our revenue and operating profit.

Third Quarter Financial Results

Total revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $45.3 million, a decrease of $20.6 million (31.3%) compared to $65.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease is related to a decrease in the number of RINs we self-marketed from 2025 RNG production in the third quarter of 2025. Our average realized RIN price in the third quarter of 2025 was $2.29 which decreased approximately 31.4% compared to $3.34 in the third quarter of 2024. Operating and maintenance expenses for our RNG facilities in the third quarter of 2025 were $13.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million (10.6%) compared to $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The primary drivers of this increase were timing of preventative maintenance, media changeout maintenance, wellfield operational enhancement programs, and utility expenses at our Rumpke, Atascocita, and Apex facilities. Our Renewable Electricity Generation operating and maintenance expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $2.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million (4.3%) compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by timing of annual engine maintenance at our Tulsa facility. Total general and administrative expenses were $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $3.5 million (35.1%) compared to $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 driven by accelerated vesting of certain restricted share awards as a result of the termination of an employee in the third quarter of 2024. Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $4.4 million, a decrease of $18.3 million (80.4%) compared to $22.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net income in the third quarter of 2025 was $5.2 million, a decrease of $11.8 million (69.5%) compared to $17.0 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Third Quarter Operational Results

We produced approximately 1.4 million Metric Million British Thermal Units (“MMBtu”) of RNG in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 53 thousand MMBtu compared to 1.4 million MMBtu produced in the third quarter of 2024. At our Rumpke facility, we produced 50 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of higher feedstock gas. At our Apex facility, we produced 25 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2025 as a result of the June 2025 commissioning of the second Apex RNG facility. Offsetting the increase was the fourth quarter of 2024 sale of our Southern facility which produced 69 MMBtu in the first nine months of 2024. We produced approximately 44 thousand megawatt hours (“MWh”) in Renewable Electricity in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 3 thousand MWh compared to 41 thousand MWh produced in the third quarter of 2024.

Our Bowerman facility produced approximately 2 thousand MWh more in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of processing equipment maintenance that was completed in the third quarter of 2024.

2025 Full Year Outlook

RNG revenues are expected to range between $150 and $170 million (unchanged)

RNG production volumes are expected to range between 5.8 and 6.0 million MMBtu (unchanged)

REG revenues are expected to range between $17 and $18 million (unchanged)

REG production volumes are expected to range between 175 and 180 thousand MWh

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release and the accompanying tables include references to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe the measures assist investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.

In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measurements of performance that management and the board of directors use in their financial and operational decision-making and in the determination of certain compensation programs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental performance measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net (loss) income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity or profitability.

The proposed legislation seeks to establish a national framework for Nigeria’s transition to electric vehicles (EVs), promote local manufacturing, and advance the nation’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

Sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North), the bill received widespread support from lawmakers, who emphasized the need for local content development, foreign investment, and nationwide charging infrastructure as key components of Nigeria’s transition to green mobility.

Leading the debate, Senator Kalu stated that the bill aims to transform the country’s automotive and energy sectors, foster technological innovation, and generate employment across the manufacturing value chain.

He explained that the legislation provides a range of incentives — including tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, subsidies, and road tax reliefs — to encourage EV adoption and investment. The bill also mandates the installation of electric vehicle charging stations at all fuel service outlets nationwide.

A major provision requires foreign automakers to partner with licensed Nigerian assemblers and establish local assembly plants within three years, with a minimum of 30% local content sourcing by 2030. Non-compliance may attract fines of up to ₦250 million per violation, while unlicensed EV importers could face penalties of ₦500 million and confiscation of their goods.

Economically, the bill positions Nigeria as a potential hub for EV manufacturing in Africa, mandating that assemblers produce at least 5,000 units annually while adhering to international safety and technical standards. Investors who establish EV charging stations will also be eligible for government grants and tax credits.

Senate President Godswill Akpabio described the bill as a forward-looking initiative aligned with President Bola Tinubu’s agenda for economic diversification and clean energy transition.",https://lagostelevision.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/senate-690x449-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 03:03:14.497045

From Rio de Janeiro to Belém, Wisconsin is showing how pragmatic, locally led climate action can power jobs, resilience, and economic growth

Standing on the waterfront in Rio de Janeiro, where hundreds of mayors, governors, and regional leaders have gathered for the COP30 Local Leaders Forum, it’s clear that local action is driving global climate progress. While world leaders prepare to meet in Belém later this month, the real momentum is here — among the subnational leaders delivering measurable results where people live and work.

And Wisconsin, led by Governor Tony Evers, is front and center.

As Co-Chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, Governor Evers joined New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and other U.S. state leaders to release the Alliance’s new Annual Report in Rio. The message was simple and strong: despite federal headwinds and denialism from some quarters, U.S. states are pressing forward — cutting climate pollution, growing the economy, and investing in a cleaner, more resilient future.

“We want the world to know that the United States continues to work at the state level to reduce emissions, create clean energy jobs, and increase resilience — regardless of what our president or anyone else says,” Evers told reporters at the opening session.

Subnational Leadership That Works

The U.S. Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing more than half the U.S. population and GDP — has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 24% since 2005, while growing GDP by 34%. Those numbers tell a powerful story: climate action and economic growth are not opposites. They’re two sides of the same coin.

Alliance states are driving the nation’s clean-energy buildout — responsible for 70% of America’s zero-emission vehicles, 68% of all public EV chargers, and nearly 200 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity added since 2005. Electricity-sector emissions alone have fallen 45% across member states.

That kind of steady progress is why subnational leadership is so vital. Even when Washington wavers, states and localities keep building, innovating, and creating jobs.

Solutions Exchange: From Policy to Practice

At the America Is All In “Solutions Exchange” sessions this week — co-hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies — governors, mayors, and business leaders shared how climate policies translate into real community benefits: lower energy bills, cleaner air, and more resilient infrastructure. It’s a shift from negotiation to delivery, and Wisconsin offers a compelling example.

Our state’s clean-energy workforce now tops 75,000 jobs, spanning manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and services. Visit Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley, and you’ll see companies like Ingeteam building EV chargers and wind-turbine components for projects across the country. These are “Made in Wisconsin” climate solutions powering the global transition.

Wisconsin’s Common-Sense Climate Playbook

In a purple state like ours, climate action succeeds when it’s rooted in kitchen-table common sense — lowering costs, creating local jobs, and protecting our air and water. That pragmatic approach is helping Wisconsin communities weather storms, modernize schools, and give businesses the predictability they need to invest.

Consider the growing number of solar installations on schools and farms, energy-efficiency upgrades in homes and small businesses, and rural areas deploying EV charging corridors that connect tourists and truckers alike. Each project cuts carbon and saves money — the definition of win-win.

Equity is also at the heart of Wisconsin’s progress. Groups like Green Homeowners United are helping low- and moderate-income families weatherize homes, replace old furnaces, and install heat pumps — ensuring the benefits of clean energy reach the people who need them most.

Resilience in the Face of Federal Uncertainty

Evers and his fellow Alliance governors are candid about the challenge ahead. With rollbacks in federal climate policy, states must stay the course — not only to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to safeguard local economies and public health. As Governor Evers noted, “Even when federal leadership falters, our resolve only grows stronger.”

The Alliance’s updated targets are ambitious yet achievable: 26% emissions reduction by 2025, 52% by 2030, and 66% by 2035. Those goals are backed by data, science, and — most importantly — people on the ground who see the benefits of cleaner energy and smarter infrastructure.

Wisconsin’s Role on the Global Stage

Here in Rio, Governor Evers’ leadership reflects something larger: Wisconsin’s growing influence in the global climate conversation. As the U.S. delegation heads to Belém, the message from states like ours is clear — progress doesn’t wait for politics. It’s built city by city, farm by farm, and business by business.

For Wisconsin, that means doubling down on what works:

Supporting manufacturers building the backbone of the clean-energy economy.

Strengthening partnerships among businesses, farms, and communities.

Protecting the public tools — like rebates, tax credits, and utility programs — that make the transition affordable and fair.

By staying pragmatic, collaborative, and grounded in results, Wisconsin can continue to punch above its weight — showing that climate leadership in a purple state is not only possible, it’s a competitive advantage.

That’s the Wisconsin story worth sharing — from Rio to Belém, from our neighborhoods to the world.

Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit—and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump administration’s ban on clean energy, multi-million-dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus. Dan Jasper, of the non-profit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six bill increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents. Democrats also criticized Republicans for embracing fossil fuels and backing away from clean energy at a time when the state faces rising demand for power.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy non-profit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about nine months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy—they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data centre operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13% of the world’s data centre capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of 2026 midterm elections. Although it is not, strictly speaking, a climate measure, the move was crafted to give Democrats as many as five more seats in the U.S. Congress. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led gerrymandering in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out five new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies—those centring on transit, in particular—won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1% increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40% of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40% will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and micro-transit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65% of voters approved a permanent 0.2% sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the U.S., one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies—and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills—won.

“Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

Adaptation is a critically important part of addressing climate change, and a world with more prosperity and less inequality is one where we can better deal with the impacts of climate change – at least up to a point.
Or as the late climate economist Marty Weitzman memorably put it, when it comes to climate change “the sting is in the tail”.
There are real costs associated with fossil fuel use: from air pollution, from climate change, from local environmental damage.
And deprioritizing climate change as an issue risks substituting near-term benefits for long term harms that are nearly impossible to reverse.","There are a lot of things I agree with in Bill Gates’ new memo on climate change. The recent cutbacks on international spending on vaccination, malaria control, feeding the hungry, and poverty alleviation by many of the richest countries (driven in part by a desire for more military spending) is a catastrophe that will cost thousands if not millions of lives. Adaptation is a critically important part of addressing climate change, and a world with more prosperity and less inequality is one where we can better deal with the impacts of climate change – at least up to a point.

But in other areas I feel that it needlessly sets up a conflict between laudable goals: we can both mitigate emissions and alleviate poverty, disease, and hunger. While there are some tradeoffs it is more a question of policy priority than a zero sum game. Similarly, I feel that Gates is a bit too cavalier in his treatment of climate risk.

Given the strong reactions to Gates’ memo both on the left and the right, I thought it would be helpful to provide a more measured reaction and critique, and give some thoughts how to move forward to – as Gates suggests – have the most positive impact on the world.

A zero sum game?

Bill Gates – through his philanthropic work with the Gates Foundation – has done more than almost anyone else on the planet to meaningfully improve the lives of the world’s poorest. The Gates Foundation was the founding funder of Gavi which helped expand vaccination in the global south and drive down prices. They did key work to help eradicate polio, combat HIV, TB and malaria, deliver sanitation and clean drinking water, and worked to raise smallholder farmer yields and income through access to agricultural technology.

The recent gutting of USAID – and smaller reductions in aid spending by other countries – is a humanitarian catastrophe and threatens to undo much of the work that the Gates Foundation supported over the past few decades. I can see why, in light of these urgent needs, he is suggesting that resources to combat climate change be repurposed toward dealing with poverty, hunger, and disease.

But this assumes that funding for climate and development (to use a term to encompass help improve the lives of the world’s poorest) are inherently zero sum. And here I think that, for the most part, Gates errs in his analysis – for a few reasons:

First, the vast majority of spending on climate mitigation worldwide is not in low income countries, and there is little reason to assume that cutting it would free up resources for development aid. The world spent more than two trillion on clean energy technologies (albeit somewhat expansively defined) in 2024, but the overwhelming majority of this was spent by middle- and high-income countries (e.g. China, the US, the EU, the UK, India, Japan, etc.) to build domestic clean energy, build transmission, buy electric vehicles, electrify heating, etc.

The idea that spending less on domestic mitigation would create more budget space for international development is fundamentally misguided. Its hard to imagine that the Trump administration will revitalize development spending based on savings from cutting domestic green energy subsidies. Both development aid and climate mitigation spending represent relatively small shares of GDP in higher income countries, and there is space for policy to be able to prioritize spending on both without trading them off against each other. It is much more likely that any reduction in mitigation spending will be repurposed for other domestic priorities – leaving the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world even worse off.

Second, there are a number of ways that technologies can accomplish goals of climate mitigation and development simultaneously. Solar and storage for electrification of more remote areas, clean cook stoves to reduce deforestation, technologies to reduce both outdoor and indoor air pollution that kills millions per year globally are a few examples.

That being said, we should take a hard look at international spending priorities for programs in the poorest countries which, in turn, are the least responsible for global emissions today. Here adaptation should be strongly prioritized, and restrictions around finance for some fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas development in Sub-Saharan Africa) that could help support greater clean energy deployment should be reconsidered. We should generally spend more than we are today on adaptation and development (though the two are strongly related), and mitigation should be less of a priority in low income countries.

Richer countries should be the ones taking the lead on emissions reductions, and paying a (green) premium that will help drive down the costs of clean energy technologies so that they can be cost effectively adopted by lower income countries. Indeed, thats largely been the story of our successes here to date, with countries like China, India, and Brazil adopting ambitious net-zero goals in part because they see the cost of meeting them as modest and not trading off against their development priorities.

Third, the idea that we should “spend less” on climate adaptation is a dangerous misunderstanding of the problem. There is no world where we don’t spend money dealing with climate impacts. Rather, our choice is between spending money now to, e.g., build a seawall, or spend money later to rebuild the city after it floods. Our choice here should be guided by the fact that adaptation in advance is cheaper than adaptation after the disaster. In other words, spending money today on adaptation is the cheaper option that will better promote health and welfare of the world’s poorest citizens.

Hedging against climate risks

In his memo, Bill Gates highlights the progress we’ve made on climate change to-date, noting that:

Ten years ago, the International Energy Agency predicted that by 2040, the world would be emitting 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. Now, just a decade later, the IEA’s forecast has dropped to 30 billion, and it’s projecting that 2050 emissions will be even lower.

Read that again: In the past 10 years, we’ve cut projected emissions by more than 40 percent.

This progress is not part of the prevailing view of climate change, but it should be. What made it possible is that the Green Premium—the cost difference between clean and dirty ways of doing something—reached zero or became negative for solar, wind, power storage, and electric vehicles. By and large, they are just as cheap as, or even cheaper than, their fossil fuel counterparts.

Gates is right that cheap clean energy represents a remarkable success story, and is one of the reasons why projections of future warming have fallen from around 3.5C a decade ago to around 2.7C today.

But focusing on these precise temperature outcomes in 2100 is problematically reductionist. Our emissions are just one of three factors that will determine the future warming of the planet (and we should remember that current policies represent neither a ceiling nor a floor on current emissions, particularly at a time when some governments are actively rolling them back).

Even if we knew future emissions precisely, the warming in 2100 remains highly uncertain. It depends both on the sensitivity of the climate to our increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations – the response of various climate feedbacks like clouds and surface reflectivity – and how the carbon cycle responds to both our emissions and the changing climate.

Due to the combination of these uncertainties, its possible that we think we are heading for 2.7C warming and actually end up at 3.7C (or even 4C+) if we roll 6s on the proverbial climate dice. And we won’t know precisely how sensitive the climate is (despite some recent progress) until its too late to avoid where we are headed.

This means that we should think of mitigation less as targeting (or avoiding) a particular certain outcome, and more as hedging against risk. We should do more mitigation – all things considered – than if we had certainty in the climate response because of the high damages associated with less-likely but still quite possible tail risks. Or as the late climate economist Marty Weitzman memorably put it, when it comes to climate change “the sting is in the tail”.

Gates is right to note that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise”, but I’d suggest that this represents a bit of a straw man. Outside a fringe community of climate doomers there are few who think that climate change could realistically threaten the extinction of the human race (though some folks need to be a bit cautious about throwing around the term “existential threat” willy nilly). As the climate scientist Steven Schneider was fond of saying, for climate change “the end of the world and good for you are the two lowest probability outcomes”.

But not being an existential threat does not tell us all that much, as almost nothing aside from a planet-killing astroid or (possibly) an all-out global thermonuclear war rises to that highest of bars. Every other problem humanity deals with – war, violence, famine, poverty – is not existential but is still critically important. This is more or less Gates’ point, that climate should be treated as one of many problems that we need to solve rather than an all-encompassing ur-problem. But by and large the majority of people and policymakers have been treating it as just that.

Green premiums and brown costs

Gates posits that society can best address climate change by working to reduce the “green premium” associated with clean energy technologies (this was more or less the central thesis of his 2021 book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.

The idea of the green premium is compelling. As noted earlier, a lot of the progress that society has made on reducing emissions over the past 15 years has come on the back of near-miraculously rapid declines in the cost of clean energy technologies. Cheaper clean energy in turn enables more ambitious policy adoption, as the costs of getting to net-zero emissions turn from astronomical to manageable.

But I’d suggest that it is somewhat incomplete, at least in its more straightforward interpretation. There is an idea that innovation and markets alone will necessarily solve the problem in the absence of policy interventions; that if we can just make clean energy cheap enough the world will sufficiently decarbonize to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts from climate change.

This may be the case, but it may not. Innovation cuts both ways – the success of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology has drastically reduced the cost of natural gas and oil production. There are lots of resources going into producing fossil fuels more cheaply, and while I’m hopeful that the cost of solar, batteries, wind, nuclear, geothermal, and other clean energy technologies will fall faster there is no law of physics that says that it will inevitably be cheaper.

Hoping that clean energy will be absolutely cheaper than fossil fuels at a scale needed to decarbonize our energy system is a gamble – and one with loaded dice. There are real costs associated with fossil fuel use: from air pollution, from climate change, from local environmental damage. These are currently borne by the public and not by the companies producing fossil fuels. As long as the costs remain socialized while the benefits are privatized, the market alone will not lead to the optimal level of deployment of clean energy technologies.

This is where policy comes in: we either need to include the “brown costs” of fossil fuels in their market price (e.g. a carbon tax, something that has been not very politically palatable to date) or be willing to pay some ongoing green premium in cases where clean energy remains more expensive to account for the real costs of climate and pollution.

Policy also plays a key role in technology. The rapid and amazing drop in the price of solar energy over the last few decades has been driven to a large extent by government support of the technology. The free market may have done this by itself, but it would have likely taken many decades longer.

I don’t think Gates would necessarily disagree with any of this, but its an important rejoinder for those who assume that innovation alone is sufficient to address the problem.

The death of nuance

The reception of the Gates memo was an unfortunate reflection of our extremely polarized politics. Some climate advocates dismissed it as denialism or the second coming of Bjorn Lomborg, while those on the right (including President Trump) portrayed it as proof that the science was wrong and climate change was actually a hoax.

Gates tried at length and upfront to make his position clear that climate is a big problem and his interest is on near-term prioritization of resources, but most interpreted the memo through their ideological priors (many likely without actually reading it).

To be clear: Climate change is a very important problem. It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition. Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.

Our inability to have nuanced discussions about these matters is detrimental to the broader societal discussion about serious issues like climate change. The portrayal of climate as an all or nothing problem coupled with the US’s thermostatic politics (where control of government commonly switches between parties) is a recipe for a lack of clear long term action on climate or any other big societal problem that gets caught up in the politicized culture wars. While I don’t know how to change society to make science less politicized and to center the debate around the best solutions rather than the physical reality of the problem, a change is sorely needed.

Balancing future and present harms

Ultimately Gates’ memo is making that case that we need to set a higher priority on helping the world’s most vulnerable in a time when aid to them is being cut. I broadly agree. But I think that deprioritizing mitigation spending is not a very effective way to accomplish that goal, outside of the relatively modest amount of money the world spends today on mitigation in the least developed countries.

When there is an option to spend money already going to these countries in a way that provides the greatest benefits for the population even if it does not reduce (or even increases) emissions, we should probably do it. But the vast majority of the resources we spend on decarbonization today in middle and upper income countries will not magically be repurposed for international development aid if we deprioritize climate change as an issue. And deprioritizing climate change as an issue risks substituting near-term benefits for long term harms that are nearly impossible to reverse.

A world of unabated climate change will impact the poor most severely. Addressing it requires two strategies in tandem: prioritizing development and poverty alleviation to build adaptive capacity (and human flourishing), and reducing emissions rapidly in middle and upper-income countries to mitigate future climate impacts and drive down the cost of clean energy technologies so they can be more readily adopted by low income countries. Perhaps I’m unduly optimistic, but I think that society should be able to do both.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8mbB!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88bd9bdf-9b18-4376-a409-1323b51c6d9b_1358x1134.png",N,,2025-11-06 04:18:34.665700

EOSE, a company specializing in zinc-based energy storage solutions, reported a challenging financial period, with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $(1.33 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and $(1.49 million) for the nine months ended. Despite increased revenue year-over-year, the company's cost of goods sold and operating expenses outpaced its earnings, leading to a gross loss of $(33,925) and $(89,417) for the respective periods. These figures underscore the company's ongoing investments in research and development, as well as its efforts to scale operations and secure its market position in the competitive energy storage sector.

Strengths

Innovative Technology and Product Offering: Eos Energy Enterprises Inc (EOSE, Financial) stands out in the energy storage market with its flagship product, the Eos Znyth™ battery system. This technology is designed for utility-scale, microgrid, and commercial & industrial applications, offering a unique value proposition with its zinc-based chemistry and durability. The Z3 battery module, a core component of the system, is the only US-designed and manufactured battery module that provides a viable alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries for 3- to 12-hour discharge duration applications. The company's investment in innovation is evident in its R&D expenses, which, while contributing to current losses, position EOSE for long-term success as it develops cost-effective and high-performance energy storage solutions.

Strategic Partnerships and Government Support: EOSE has secured strategic investments and government funding that are critical for its growth and development. The company entered into a financing transaction with Cerberus Capital Management LP, securing a $210.5 million Delayed Draw Term Loan and a $105 million Revolving Facility. Additionally, EOSE closed on the DOE Loan Facility, which provides up to $303.45 million in funding, subject to certain conditions. These partnerships not only infuse EOSE with the necessary capital but also validate the company's potential in the eyes of investors and the government. The support from the Inflation Reduction Act, offering production tax credits for domestically manufactured battery components, further strengthens EOSE's competitive position.

Weaknesses

Financial Performance and Liquidity Concerns: Eos Energy Enterprises Inc's financial health is a significant concern, as reflected in its substantial losses and negative cash flows. The company's reliance on external capital to fund its operations is a testament to the challenges it faces in achieving profitability. The recent financial statements reveal a net loss attributable to common shareholders of over $1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025. This financial strain is exacerbated by the company's ongoing need for capital to support its ambitious growth strategy, which includes scaling manufacturing capabilities and expanding its product offerings. The financial covenants associated with its credit facilities, such as Minimum Liquidity and Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, add pressure to maintain financial stability.

Operational and Scale-up Risks: As EOSE transitions to its next-generation product, the Eos Z3 battery, the company faces risks associated with scaling up its manufacturing capabilities. The complexity of automating production lines and the need to ensure product quality and performance at scale present operational challenges. The company's ability to forecast related costs and efficiencies accurately is crucial to its success. Any missteps in this transition could lead to increased costs, delays, and potential reputational damage, hindering EOSE's ability to meet growing market demand and maintain its competitive edge.

Opportunities

Expanding Market for Energy Storage: The global shift towards renewable energy sources and the need for reliable energy storage solutions present significant opportunities for Eos Energy Enterprises Inc. The company's Znyth™ technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional battery systems. With the increasing integration of renewable energy into the grid, the demand for energy storage systems that can provide longer discharge durations is expected to grow, providing EOSE with a vast market to tap into.

Policy and Regulatory Tailwinds: Government policies and incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, are favorable for companies like EOSE. These policies provide production tax credits and funding opportunities for domestic manufacturing and infrastructure projects, which could significantly benefit EOSE's operations and financial performance. By leveraging these incentives, EOSE can potentially reduce costs, increase sales, and enhance its market presence in the United States.

Threats

Intense Competition and Market Volatility: The energy storage market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Eos Energy Enterprises Inc faces stiff competition from established companies and new entrants offering lithium-ion and other energy storage technologies. Market volatility, driven by fluctuations in raw material prices and supply chain disruptions, further complicates EOSE's operational and financial planning. The company must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain a competitive advantage in this challenging environment.

Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: EOSE's financial stability and growth prospects are subject to broader economic

Once installed the new tech should boost the efficiency of green hydrogen production.

The technology, supplied by Ampt, uses string optimisers to improve solar power systems. These small electronic devices control the output of each solar panel and allow the overall system to perform at its best, even if some panels are shaded or underperforming.

By improving power delivery from the solar farm, Ampt’s technology enables Hiringa’s GEGHA project to more efficiently generate green hydrogen and ammonia – the core ingredients of a low-carbon fertiliser being used on the farm’s cotton crops.

The GEGHA project aims to make agricultural production more sustainable by producing fertiliser and hydrogen through a combination of solar power, battery storage, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis.

It received $23.6m in funding from the NSW government and is located at Sundown Pastoral’s Good Earth cotton farm near the town of Moree.

The project integrates electrolysis more efficiently by using power management and storage technology to reduce energy losses. The 27 MWdc solar array and 30 MWh battery energy storage system provide a continuous, off-grid power supply to the electrolysers, which produce hydrogen for ammonia production around the clock.

“By delivering higher performance and lower costs, our string optimisers help make renewable hydrogen and ammonia economically competitive,” said Russell French, Country Director of Australia at Ampt.

“Green hydrogen and ammonia production places unique demands on power systems, and Ampt’s DC power management technology enables us to maximise solar generation and storage efficiency – [the] key to making production cost-competitive,” added Alistair Tippett, Head of Projects and Engineering at Hiringa Energy.

The process starts at the solar farm, which generates renewable energy to power the electrolysers. This produces green hydrogen, which is then used both to run farm machinery and to make low-carbon ammonia. The ammonia is used as a fertiliser for the cotton crop, replacing conventional fossil fuel-based fertilisers.

Once operational, the improved facility is expected to produce around 224 tonnes of green hydrogen and 4,500 tonnes of low-carbon ammonia each year, cutting up to 17,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2023/09/shutterstock_1459390562.jpg",N,,2025-11-06 10:00:19.839480

I’ll be doing some grant writing and working with different community partners and other city departments on some environmental initiatives.”

Her main priorities in her new role include proper trash disposal and community outreach. She was instrumental in implementing curbside recycling and reviving Keep Victoria Beautiful in 2019. She served on the board for six years, two as vice chair and last four as chair.

As a board member, she led community cleanups, organized volunteer work and environmental education.

“Increasing our engagement with youth, with the schools, is a big priority that we have, that I’m excited to work on,” Byrd said. “We have some grant money for waste diversion education, correct recycling and other efforts. We’re going to continue doing lots of education centered around proper disposal of trash and recycling.”

She added that the Waste Wizard tool on Victoria’s website is a great tool that tells people how to distribute their waste. In her role, she will promote the website and use it as an educational tool.

H.R. 1267, the Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act, provides clean water agencies and biosolids managers with explicit CERCLA liability exemptions for PFAS contamination. CASA supports this legislation, which is currently pending before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. It is essential that Congress pass H.R. 1267 to protect our sector.

To this end, CASA agencies are encouraged to send letters of support for H.R. 1267 to their congressional delegations using the provided template letter. Letters should be submitted between now and December.

Senate WIPPES Act Report Outlines Need

A new Senate report on the WIPPES Act (S.1092) underscores the importance of clear “Do Not Flush” labeling for non-flushable wipes, 90% of which are still entering U.S. markets without proper warnings. The report outlines the bill’s goals, expected impacts, and next steps as it moves closer to consideration on the Senate floor.

The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has released its report on the WIPPES Act (S. 1092), which establishes a national mandate for “Do Not Flush” labeling requirements for non-flushable wet wipes and mirrors existing California law. In its report, the committee outlines the purpose of the bill, its provisions, and the expected associated impacts if S.1092 were enacted. Importantly, the report emphasizes the need for the WIPPES Act, as citing that 90% of the wipes products sold in the U.S. are non-flushable wipes and that proper labeling notifying consumers to not flush these wipes leads to reduced improper flushing as a means of disposal.

While the report notes that implementing the bill, if it were enacted into law, would cost the Federal Trade Commission $4 million over 2025-2030 based upon the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates, it states that the “compliance costs associated with S.1092’s labeling requirements are expected to be minimal. It is believed that such expenses will be outweighed by decreased operating costs for wastewater systems from reduced disposal of non-flushable wipes into wastewater systems.”

At the end of September, S.1092 was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar following the successful bipartisan markup of the bill earlier this spring. The action to place the S.1092 on the Senate Legislative Calendar represents a step forward in the process for the bill to be considered on the Senate Floor.

The Government Shutdown Drags into Its Fifth Week; Federal Workforce Furloughs Continue

The federal shutdown has stretched into its 36th day, surpassing the previous record of 34-days during the 2019 shutdown. Over the past month, Senate negotiations have remained stalled over health care subsidy extensions, while the House continues to be on recess. As federal workers miss paychecks and agency furloughs expand, the ripple effects are growing across the nation.

For more than a month now, the federal government has been shut down. The Senate has continually failed to pass the House-passed Continuing Resolution (CR), as Senate Democrats have been unwavering in their demand that a final CR include an extension for the expiring Affordable Health Care insurance premium subsidies. Meanwhile, the House has remained on recess. At the time of this writing, there are reports that rank-and-file Senate Democrats and Republicans have begun the early stages of discussions on what a policy “fix” could be for the premium subsidies issue, but it is unclear what a resolution could include. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has reiterated that an extension of the ACA insurance subsidies will require 60-votes to pass. This is important as it signals that Senate Republicans will not, at the time of this writing, do away with the filibuster as the President has suggested to resolve the impasse. This means that Republicans will need Democrats to vote with them to pass any future deal that is struck. Further complicating the shutdown saga and adding new sources of pressure to the issue is that federal workers have now missed their first paychecks, funding for popular social safety net programs risk lapsing, health insurance marketplaces have opened with increased premiums for some, and concerns of increasing air traffic delays as the nation approaches a busy holiday travel period later this month. Beyond these new impacts, the federal agencies continue to furlough employees deemed as ‘non-essential’ under shutdown contingency plans. At the end of last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency furloughed an additional 4,000 workers. These furloughs will continue to exacerbate the delays in federal agency operations.

According to the Governor’s office, this decrease in energy costs is linked to keeping key nuclear power plants operational without emissions. Governor Hochul stated that ensuring ""energy affordability for New York consumers"" and that ""the lights stay on"" remain priorities.

The ZEC program, established by the New York State Public Service Commission in 2016, recognizes the four Upstate nuclear power plants for their zero-emission contributions. Following the 2022 federal nuclear production tax credit, any resulting benefits are required to be passed on to ratepayers. Constellation Energy, which operates the reactors at three facilities along the shores of Lake Ontario, will utilize the federal tax credit, leading to savings for the state’s electricity consumers and an increase in clean electricity production, according to a statement obtained by the Governor’s office.

Rory M. Christian, Chair of the New York State Public Service Commission, said that the ZEC program provides flexibility and that federal support contributes to New York’s energy stability while offering financial relief to residents. Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, stated that a balanced energy mix, which includes the existing nuclear fleet and federal tax credits, supports energy security and affordability. She also noted that these savings are relevant to the development of advanced nuclear technologies.

This financial update is part of a broader strategy by Governor Hochul’s administration to support energy affordability. The administration has implemented an Enhanced Energy Affordability Policy, redirected surplus funding to consumer protection programs, and adjusted plans for offshore wind transmission development in response to federal policy changes. These efforts are complemented by initiatives to expand participation in energy efficiency programs, particularly for low- and moderate-income households, which will receive an additional $132 million in annual funding, as reported by the Governor’s office.

Governor Hochul has implemented consumer protection measures, including a comprehensive audit to ensure utilities are providing value to ratepayers, stricter performance standards with enforcement authority, and the recovery of approximately $214.4 million from utility shareholders for ratepayer benefit since 2021.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/11/gov-hochul-announces-dollar151m-energy-bill-savings-for-new-yorkers-by-2026-through-zero-emissions-credits-program-18.webp,N,,2025-11-06 00:02:03.748811

Risks

Alan Haughie noted, ""OSB prices spent most of the quarter barely above variable cost, driven by sluggish demand, particularly in the Southeast,"" resulting in a significant year-over-year decline in segment EBITDA and ongoing margin pressures.

Management guided to a $45 million EBITDA loss for OSB in the fourth quarter, with total company EBITDA projected ""about $10 million lower than the sum of citing and OSB breakeven,"" according to Alan Haughie for the full year.

The South America segment is ""struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment,"" posing a drag on consolidated financial performance.

Takeaways

Total sales -- Down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to an extended trough in OSB prices and soft demand.

EBITDA -- $82 million, noted as a significant year-over-year decline driven by OSB market conditions.

Siding segment revenue -- Up 5% year-over-year, mainly from a 5% increase in average selling price and improved mix, exceeding internal expectations and guidance.

Expert Finish product volume -- Up 17%, representing 10% of overall siding volume and 17% of siding revenue.

Expert Finish price realization -- Average selling prices up 12%, with the naturals collection launch materially contributing to favorable mix impact.

OSB segment OEE -- Overall equipment effectiveness reached 80%, an increase of two percentage points from the prior year.

Operating cash flow -- $89 million generated in the quarter, with $84 million deployed for capital expenditures supporting Expert Finish and Structural products.

Ending cash balance -- $316 million, with over $1 billion of liquidity including the undrawn credit facility.

Siding EBITDA guidance -- Full-year EBITDA expectation reaffirmed at $430 million, with Q4 revenue guided to approximately $370 million and EBITDA around $82 million.

Total company EBITDA guidance -- Full-year EBITDA now forecast at $420 million, reflecting a $20 million improvement from the prior guide, but $10 million lower than the sum of segment targets owing to corporate and South America factors.

CapEx guidance -- Total capital expenditure guidance is being reduced further due to deferred OSB projects and optionality afforded by manufacturing network headroom.

Managed order file -- Demand for Expert Finish outstripped available capacity, resulting in a managed order file until incremental production comes online in early Q2 2026.

2026 siding price increase -- Jason Ringblum said, ""we are really targeting the net somewhere between 3%-4% in 2026.""

OSB utilization rate -- Currently in the 67%-69% range, aligned with committed contract volumes rather than open-market sales.

Mill conversion strategy -- Management is evaluating a conversion of the Manawaki OSB mill to siding production, citing greater scale and likely improved capital efficiency over Holton; no near-term decision, with process extending several quarters.

Summary

Louisiana-Pacific (LPX 0.73%) announced CEO succession, with Jason Ringblum set to succeed Brad Southern in February, as the company highlighted the continuation of its transformation strategy. Management confirmed a 5% increase in siding segment revenue drove overall mix improvement, while consolidated sales and EBITDA declined due to continued OSB price weakness. Leadership identified Expert Finish as a key growth engine, supported by a strong managed order file and new capacity expected online next year. Despite muted OSB and South American results, management raised full-year EBITDA guidance to $420 million and reduced capital spending amid ongoing network optimization. The company revealed that price increases for siding are planned to average 3%-4% in 2026, and the decision timeline for a major mill conversion remains open several quarters due to less urgent capacity needs.

Aaron Howald clarified that current Section 232 tariffs do not impact OSB and siding imports from Canada, and ""the importation of some heavy equipment categories into The United States is less favorable than it is into Canada currently,"" providing a potential equipment sourcing benefit for Canadian projects.

Ringblum provided that the Manawaki OSB facility offers potential siding production capacity of approximately 400 million feet, a scale advantage considered in mill conversion analysis.

Management stated that, if housing demand rebounds faster than expectations, existing flexible capacity and shifts would allow rapid response, ensuring supply for both North America and South America businesses.

Ringblum reported that despite current market softness in new construction, the company continues to observe share gains in the repair and remodel segment and believes Expert Finish growth has substantial runway given ""our market share in that segment is tiny. Relative to the opportunity.""

Haughie confirmed, ""South American business is also struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment,"" affecting consolidated profitability.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Brad Southern: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'll discuss some highlights from the quarter before Alan shares more detail about our results and updated guidance. After that, Jason, Alan, and I will be happy to take your questions. As expected, excited volume in the third quarter was flat. This result in a softening market, especially compared to the difficult comp from last year, reinforces our confidence in our ongoing share gains. 5% growth in Siding sales revenue driven primarily by price and a strong mix exceeded our expectations and guidance.

While we anticipated the normalization of demand in the shed component of our siding business, our expert finish pre-finish siding product, primarily designed for R&R applications, saw sales volumes increase by 17% year over year. The April launch of our expert finished naturals collection, which is a new line of nature-inspired two-tone colors, has contributed materially to a beneficial price mix effect. Expert finished accounted for 10% of overall siding volume, and 17% of overall siding revenue in the quarter, showing once again the power of smart site innovation to drive price, volume growth, and share gains. Inventory levels and sell-through rates held steady through the quarter.

Alan Haughie: Consistent with servicing seasonally normal demand levels. The only exception is expert finish, which remains in such high demand that we have implemented a managed order file until new capacity comes online early next year. Total sales in the quarter were down 8% compared to the prior year, and EBITDA of $82 million was also down significantly. The extended trough in OSB prices was the main drag on both metrics. We obviously cannot control OSB prices, but we can manage the OSB business effectively. And our teams did that exceptionally well in the face of what remains a difficult market. The OSB business achieved 80% overall equipment effectiveness or OEE in the quarter, up two points from last year.

Increasing OEE is never easy, and it can be particularly challenging when we are also managing our capacity with discipline to balance supply and demand. I want to congratulate and thank everyone on the OSB operations team who contributed to this impressive achievement. Our results are only possible because of our teams and the strong culture we have built. In the third quarter, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation was named one of the 50 best manufacturers in The United States by Industry Week, debuting on the list at number 24, and one of very few specialty building products manufacturers to be recognized. We were also named by Newsweek as one of America's most admired workplaces.

Finally, as you saw, I informed Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's board of my intention to retire this coming February after more than 25 years of service. It has been the honor of my career to lead a 4,300-person team. Ultimately, the job of a CEO is to build an engaged culture focused on safety, growth, innovation, and execution to deliver value long after he or she is gone. When we launched Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's transformation strategy, I was daunted by the challenges we faced and the aggressive goals we've set for value creation. I am proud to say that we exceeded those goals.

As Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's team and strategy have evolved, the magnitude of the opportunity before us has only grown, and our confidence that we can continue to execute our strategy and achieve our ambitious goals has never been stronger. Jason Ringblum and I have been friends and colleagues for over 20 years. He was instrumental in the development and execution of Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's strategic transformation. He led Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's OSB and EWP businesses for five years and for the last three led Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's siding business before being named president. This perspective makes him uniquely suited to serve as Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's next CEO. I have total confidence that with Jason, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's future has never been brighter.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Alan.

Alan Haughie: Thanks, Brad. Before discussing the results, I do want to take a moment to say that working for Brad has been a personal and professional highlight for me. And, while they may be tough shoes to fill, I can think of no one better suited for this task than Jason. And with that, slide seven of the presentation shows Siding's results for the quarter. As expected, the bulk of growth came from price. Average selling prices were up 5% with prime products up 3% and expert finished prices up 12%. And there were two mixed phenomena helping this along. First, as Brad mentioned, shared segment volumes normalized after a very strong first half.

And as I'm sure you'll recall, strong shed volumes have been a drag on prices earlier in the year, so part of the 5% year-over-year price performance this quarter is simply the lower mix of shed relative to primed and expert finished products. The other mix factor was within expert finish itself, where demand for Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's two-tone naturals and other higher-priced prefinished products drove outsized year-over-year price gains. This mix shift is also evident in the year-over-year volume column, which shows relatively flat volumes in total but within which prime volumes were down 1% and expert finished volumes were up 17%.

Selling and marketing investments, raw material inflation, and other factors were fairly typical, but there are some moving pieces in the other column that they're mentioning. You may recall that the third quarter of last year saw an unusually high EBITDA margin, in part because of delays in maintenance projects and the resulting inventory build. Impacts which then reversed in the following quarter. So much of what you see in the $20 million of other in this waterfall is the non-recurrence of those events from last year. Among them, inventory absorption is actually a double hit. I.e., we built inventory in the third quarter of last year, which boosted EBITDA, whereas this year, we've reduced inventory temporarily hurts EBITDA.

But in the long run, it's all just timing. Viewing the second half of the year in total simplifies the year-over-year comparisons considerably. The $2 million tariff impact is the retiree tariffs Louisiana-Pacific Corporation had been paying to import expert finish into Canada. Those tariffs were rescinded in late August, so we are not currently incurring that expense. Also, as I'm sure you're aware, the section 232 tariff announcements did not impact Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's OSB or siding manufactured in Canada and imported into The US. So other than minor tariff impacts on some of our raw materials, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation is currently bearing minimal tariff costs.

The OSB chart on Slide eight tells a simple if bleak story of soft OSB prices in a challenging demand environment. OSB prices spent most of the quarter barely above variable cost, driven by sluggish demand, particularly in the Southeast. Price realization fared somewhat better than expected due to a combination of the lag in contact oil prices and structural solutions mix. And while the small non-price variances mask it rather well, the OSB operations team played the hand they were dealt exceptionally well. Overall efficiency hit 80%, up two points from last year, and aggressive cost control helped the OSB segment outperform our algorithmic guidance.

Now superficially, this waterfall suggests that price is the only thing that matters in OSB. Perhaps a more accurate reading is that if price is this low, everything matters. I tip my hat to the OSB team for making the best of a very difficult market. Slide nine shows cash flow for the quarter, which, while straightforward, very much continues to reinforce the value of Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's transformation. $82 million of EBITDA translated to $89 million of operating cash flow after minor puts and takes for working capital taxes and interest. Solutions We invested $84 million in CapEx to support growth of Expert Finish and Structural as well as to ensure that our plants continue to operate safely and efficiently.

And after $19 million in dividends, we ended the quarter with $316 million in cash, over a billion dollars of liquidity including our undrawn credit facility. Which brings us to guidance on Slide 10. Regrettably, OSB prices have scarcely moved since the last call, so our fourth quarter OSB guidance has only slightly improved. The beneficial life factors that helped the third quarter have dissipated given how long prices have remained in the doldrums. So all else equal, price realization in the fourth quarter will likely provide less of a tailwind than it did in the third.

The resulting $45 million of EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter and breakeven for the year are, as always, algorithmic projections of current prices and utilization. For siding, we reaffirm our full year EBITDA guidance of $430 million. However, for the fourth quarter, the market has continued to weaken so we anticipate slightly softer growth. We still expect a year-over-year revenue increase in the coming quarter, but of about 3%, and this mostly from price. And much like the third quarter, we expect an outsized contribution from Expert Finish to both volume and price. We are therefore guiding to fourth quarter revenue of about $370 million and to EBITDA of about $82 million.

Now this slightly reduces our full year revenue growth rate from 9% to 8%. For revenue of roughly $1.68 billion while increasing our full year EBITDA margin guide to about 26%. Now our South American business is also struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment. Therefore, total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year are both expected to be about $5 million lower than the sum of the siding and OSB. Nonetheless, our expectation for full year total company EBITDA has actually risen by $20 million from $405 million three months ago to $425 million today. But we're also cutting our CapEx guidance.

There are two factors in play here. First, given the current emphasis on capacity management and cost discipline in OSB, we are deferring even more projects. In OSB. In siding, we're balancing steadily improving OEE and initiatives to optimize Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's entire manufacturing portfolio against the backdrop of persistent market softness. As a result, the sense of urgency that motivated Holton's expansion as the fastest route to additional capacity is now somewhat diminished. And this makes our OSB mill in Manawaki, Quebec a viable candidate for conversion to siding. An option we are now exploring.

So should we ultimately proceed down that path, it would most likely still provide additional siding capacity in advance of market demand, and would likely do so at a larger scale and with greater capital efficiency. So while we weigh these options, we have paused any further mill-specific spending while continuing the longer lead time mill agnostic investments. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.

George Staphos: Thanks so much. I appreciate all the details, everyone. And know, I know everyone will say it. Congratulations, Brad and Jason, on the news, and we wish you continued progress and success in the next chapters. I guess the first question I had, Alan, if you could just give us a bit more detail in terms of the potential shift from Holton to Manawaki, what's behind it, you know, how will we ultimately see it one manifest itself versus the other in terms of operations and performance.

And the second question I had, you know, maybe more for Jason and Brad, there have obviously been some headlines in the last couple days about in the last couple weeks about, you know, marketing battles, some of your peers, extending relationships with some of the building products distributors to push product, that maybe is a more competitive backdrop. Would you agree with that? Does that, you know, change the way you market, or does that actually help you because your peers might have some other things that they're focused on relative to the siding business? Thanks, and I'll turn it over there. Thank you.

Alan Haughie: George, thanks for the questions. Before I we will address your two questions. Before we get to that, I've just realized that I did misspeak slightly in my prepared remarks a moment ago when I was describing the impact of LPSA on the full year EBITDA guide. In the fourth quarter, the difference between LPSA and corporate unallocated expenses is indeed $5 million. For the full year, as you'll note from the published materials that went out this morning, the difference isn't $5 million, but it's $10 million. And so just to be clear, the full year EBITDA is expected to be $420 million. Excuse me, or about $10 million lower than the sum of citing and OSB breakeven.

There's still an increase. On the preview guidance. Sorry. I've got a fog in my throat. Hold on. And now I'm gonna turn over the question on Manawaki to my friend and colleague, Jason.

Jason Ringblum: Yeah, thanks for the question, George. I'll touch a little bit on milk conversion options. I guess, when you think about it holistically, the beauty of our position here at Louisiana-Pacific Corporation is that we have multiple options. I'll go through those just quickly. We've mentioned them on previous calls, but you know, we have the opportunity to expand existing siding plants. So you know, imagine a line parallel to an existing line at a current siding plant. I also had the opportunity to convert additional OSB facilities in Aspen Wood Bass. So Manawaki, as Alan mentioned, is an option along with Peace Valley.

And then also the potential for a greenfield that would leverage sites that we own today in Wawa, Ontario, or Cook, Minnesota. With that said, what I would say is the decision on the next mill will really come down to timing. And capital efficiency really coupled with the network optimization benefits that any given option has the potential to add. So we're still assessing all of those options that I mentioned, but as Alan stated, you know, Manawaki has surfaced to the top here more recently just given the OSD market.

Then the second part of your just around the competitive dynamics, what I would say is generally, we have not seen a whole lot of disruption within the channel. I mean, this is the time of year where you know, new programs are being put in place. We're navigating RFPs with we're focused on our strategy and different customers. But, right now, we're just really trying to minimize the noise and continue to focus on gaining share.

George Staphos: Hey, Jason. Just a quick one. I'll turn it over. Aside from the fiber basket, for Manawaki, what else makes it potentially rise to the surface more quickly?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. So Manawaki is a large OSB facility. So it's got the ability to produce 600 million to 650 million feet of OSB, which translates to call it, 400 million-ish of siding. So just the scale and relative cost position of that facility coupled with just the network optimization opportunities that it presents will all be factored into the analysis.

George Staphos: Okay. I see. Let me turn it over. I'll come back. Thank you.

Operator: Standby for the next caller. The next call comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my congrats to both Brad and Jason as well. Looking forward to working with you.

Jason Ringblum: Thanks, Susan.

Susan Maklari: My first okay. The first question is talking about the pricing environment in citing. You've traditionally announced an increase late in or sometime in the fourth quarter. For effective in early the following year. Just given the world that we're in and the varying dynamics around housing the consumer, how are you thinking about pricing as we look to 2026?

Jason Ringblum: Thanks for your question, Susan. I'll take that one. So as of, I guess, the last seven to ten days, we did announce a price increase very consistent with what you've seen us do in prior years. Along with that, we are managing our order intake to really minimize any sort of build in the channel in advance of our price increase. So you know, really, those orders that are placed throughout December and in our January order file will come at the new price list. So nothing unusual here. What I would say is increases vary by product category and geography, but we are really targeting the net somewhere between 3-4% in 2026.

Susan Maklari: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. And then turning to OSB, when you think about the environment that the builders are facing and the commentary we're hearing, especially from the big publics around pulling back on start to end this year and then even into early 2026. How are you thinking about balancing that capacity the near term pressures that are there relative to the longer term outlook for housing? And just adjusting the cost structure on a relative basis given those factors?

Jason Ringblum: Yes. So demand for OSB has certainly been soft for the better part of the year and as a result, our focus has really been on matching capacity to demand, no different than what we've done you know, in prior years where we've experienced soft markets. What I would say today is our utilization rate for OSB is in the high sixties. Which is essentially which essentially matches our committed volumes for the business. So what we felt is if we sell open market wood or bring cash wood to the market, largely, it ends up in lower prices. So right now, we're focused on really managing costs and optimizing our network relative to the demand we see today.

Susan Maklari: Okay. Thanks for the color. Good luck with the quarter.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you. Thank you.

Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ketan Mamtora: Good morning. Thank you. Brad, I wanted to extend my congratulations as well. I mean, it's been a remarkable transformation. This is a much company today. Than what it used to be even ten or fifteen years back. So congratulations.

Brad Southern: Thank you, Ketan.

Ketan Mamtora: And, Jason, look forward to working with you. Maybe to start with, can you talk a little bit about you mentioned shed volumes normalizing in Q3. Can you talk about sort of what you saw there in Q3 and what's contemplated by way of volumes as you think about Q4?

Jason Ringblum: So I would say, Ketan, and I'll take that one. I mean, throughout Q3, our order intake and sell-through rates were pretty consistent. In fact, I would say they held up better than maybe we anticipated given the broader softening in the housing and repair remodel markets. And I think that's a testament really to our commercial team and our focus on innovating around the needs of our end-user customers, specifically expert finish, smooth siding, naturals, as Brad mentioned, being great product additions that have helped offset the weakness in some of the market segments we play in.

Specific to shed, you know, what I would say is, yes, business has normalized in that segment, but we were up year over year. So we're very pleased with the progress we continue to make in that particular segment. And we see that continuing going into Q4 as well. Really, the softness resides more in the new construction segment, particularly in the southern markets. And we see a little bit more resilience in repair remodel especially in the northern markets where we have a more dominant share position.

Alan Haughie: Jason, I'll just add to that. Sorry, Ketan. I'll just add that historically, we've kind of seen a bit of seasonality in the shed business where our distributor partners and the shed builders tend to build some inventory in anticipation of spring and summer sales. And that kind of backing off as we get through the summer. And I think this what we saw seasonally in shed is pretty consistent with the historic trends that have driven our order file in the past.

Ketan Mamtora: Got it. No. That's helpful. And then just one more question. It seems like, you know, you are also sort of in the way you are selling sort of your siding products and your OSB products, it seems like there is some transition happening where you're trying to align both these products and select, you know, kind of more as a bundle. Can you talk to sort of you know, what is driving that move and what kind of reception you're getting with your customers?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I'll take that one Ketan. Appreciate the question. So back in April, we announced the integration of our OSB and siding businesses. And really the main reason for that was to better leverage our resources and better leverage the breadth of our product portfolio in the marketplace. So you're right. We are working on some bundling of programs to help us execute our segment strategies in all areas that we play in. But I would say we're still very much in the infancy stage of that process. We've made some good progress in the big builder segment, but it's still an area we're exploring largely.

Ketan Mamtora: Got it. No. That's helpful. I'll jump back in the queue. Good luck.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you.

Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Sean Steuart with TD Cowen. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Sean Steuart: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'll extend my congratulations to both Brad and Jason as well. I wanna follow-up on the Manawaki pivot. Can you give us a sense of the timeline to at least start this project and when you think it might be producing siding product, and attached to that question, does the section 232 determination which exempts OSB and siding from Canada, does that factor into the decision at all? And I guess broader perspectives, the determination on section 232 sort of left it open-ended that the administration can consider changes to the assessments as time unfolds.

I guess the short question is, are you comfortable that this will be an extended or a permanent exemption for OSB inciting from Canada? I'll leave it there.

Aaron Howald: Yeah. Sean, this is Aaron. I'll take the 232 component of that question. I don't think anybody's comfortable that policies are current in the current administration, but I will say that the decision to shift to Manawaki, should we make it, will be a long-term decision based on our long-term expectations about the evolving OSB and siding markets. The current situation for the 232 tariffs is that neither of those products is subject to a tariff importing it from Canada into The United States. And perhaps a less understood component of the 232 discussion is that the importation of some heavy equipment categories into The United States is less favorable than it is into Canada currently.

So, for example, if we were to acquire a press or other large equipment for a conversion of an OSB plant in Canada, we would be able to import that equipment at a lower cost into Canada than into The US because of those tariffs. I would like to stress, though, that would be a potential benefit, but it's not a reason for the decision. The 232 issue is not the decision maker. It is noise that currently is a net benefit, but the long-term reasons for Manawaki, should we make that decision, would be that the fundamental market dynamics and the efficiencies that mill would bring.

Brad Southern: Sean, the way you know, the process is as you can tell, as we've gone you know, we try to be transparent on these calls and talk about the different options. And some rise to the top and then some fade from the top. And so it is certainly dynamic. But, you know, the evaluation that we do is financially driven long-term financial driven as Aaron said. And there are components that specifically to tariffs or you know, when you look at wood cost, you look at particularly network optimization. Manawaki is in a really interesting place for us when you align it with our existing infrastructure, including what we're doing around expert finish growth.

And so but as we continue to do the evaluation over the next several quarters, we'll continue to evaluate all options in the face of a good strong financial analysis. Then when we get ready to present to our board, you know, that's when the rubber hits the road around you know, crystallizing around one facility and being able to explain you know, from a return standpoint why that one was chosen. So more to come on that, but we did think it was worth mentioning Manawaki as a prime candidate or might perhaps the prime candidate right now given that we haven't talked about that much in the past.

Sean Steuart: Understood. And maybe just one follow-up there, Brad. I you know, part of this reordering of the options is the extent to which OSB markets unraveled here, the last several months. I mean, you've positioned this as it's a long-term decision based on optimization of the fiber basket, the portfolio you have, is there any read through on you view this OSB downturn as potentially extended beyond what we would normally see and you're considering Manawaki in that context as well, this could be a longer trough than we're accustomed to seeing for OSB?

Brad Southern: No. We were not intending to signal that at all. I mean, it certainly the, you know, the near-term outlook for OSB is pretty abysmal. But we believe in the business in the long term. Really, what put this one up was, as Jason mentioned, or I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the timing we were leaning on Holton because we felt that we could get there faster with a conversion.

And so when really, it's the overall softening in the housing outlook overall gave us say, another year of capacity in our existing network, which allowed us to take a step back and say, you know, if we're not as in much of a hurry as we thought we were in, six months ago, what are other options? And that's really when we started focusing in on Manawaki. Was not OSB related that drove that.

Operator: Stand by, please. I believe your mic just went out for a minute. Standby, Sean. Are you still able to hear me? Can you hear me well?

Sean Steuart: I can hear them. They're I cannot. No.

Operator: Okay. Great. I just want to double check. I'm gonna have them dial back in. If everyone could please stand by. Please stand by for a moment while we get everyone reconnected.

Brad Southern: Joe, can you hear us now?

Operator: Oh, yes. We can. Great. I can hear you. And, Sean, you're still there?

Sean Steuart: I am. I'm all good, guys.

Brad Southern: You can go on to the next. So you got so did you hear? I mean, that such a great it's probably the best answer of my CEO career, and I got cut off in the middle of it.

Operator: You're leaving on a high note. I think I got the gist of it. All good, guys.

Brad Southern: Thanks, Sean.

Operator: Stand by for our next question, please. The next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Mark Weintraub: I don't know, Brad. I don't know if he should ask any more questions after that. That high note. But congrats to all, of course. So maybe just a little bit more on the thinking on the Manawaki, Holton. So, I mean, your volumes this year aren't that different from what you were expecting.

So, I mean, it seems to suggest that you're taking a little bit more of a cautious perspective on next year, and, obviously, it's pretty early, maybe help us think that through a little bit and when you say several quarters, does that mean you're kinda thinking you it's like a don't need it for close to a year later than what you would have initially anticipated wanting the volume up.

Brad Southern: Marcus, really, the key driver is we were forecasting internally improving housing starts, you know, at a pace higher than the current forecast is. And so when we were looking at you know, I don't know the industry adding 75,000 to a 100,000 new starts each year, year over year over year. You know, that was that was got us on a path of sooner rather than later on this conversion. But as we've looked at the most recent starts forecast that we follow, they're it seems pretty flat or low single-digit growth year over year. So that difference in outlook for housing you know, has given us some degrees of freedom on timing for it.

I will say know, it's been really nice to see Segola operating at the level that it's operating at now, which has provided a good bit of near-term headroom on that. And so but I do feel like the I mean, I do I know that the reason we were able to take a breath on expediting a mill conversion is halting as we just looked at the housing forecast that folks are putting out there. And as we aligned with that, felt like we had another year of time to make a conversion. Versus being very rushed.

And, you know, rushed caused us to go to Holton because it would be the quickest, but it also rush would have significantly increased the capital expense too. So I think we're in a good place to where we still got headroom that we need if housing was to get stronger than forecasted, which we certainly hope happens. We feel really good about having options other than Holton, which will be a little more capital efficient for us.

Mark Weintraub: Super. And maybe could you expand a little bit on that in terms of capital efficiency recognizing you're still in the evaluation stage? But order of magnitude how much capital might be required for a Manawaki conversion? And, also, does this mean that your cap spend in 2026 is actually gonna be more reduced than maybe what some of us would have been thinking previously?

Alan Haughie: Great questions, Mark. None of which we're really in a position to answer with sufficient reliability or confidence yet. You'll we'll deliver more on this topic on our full-year earnings call in February.

Brad Southern: Yeah. Fair enough. Great question. Sorry. We're just not in a not in a position to answer.

Mark Weintraub: Understood. And then just last if I could. So with the Sheds business, obviously, it had been quite weak last year. Much stronger this year. You give us any sense as to, where the sheds business? And I recognize even you guys don't have perfect visibility on this. But your best estimate is where that business is now relative to kind of trend line? Or, I mean, did we have some catch-up this year so that there is downside risk to next year in a normal environment or is it more that it was just so bad last year, these this really strong growth just got us back up to what you'd consider to be? Kind of a typical year?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I'll take that one. So what I'd say, you know, there was a fair amount of pull-forward demand in shed during COVID. So our business was very strong in those years, and to some extent, you know, we supported that segment to a higher degree than others while we were on a managed order file. That pullback that we felt in late 2023, 2024 I think, was a result of that. We've seen the shed business return back to normal levels. If not, maybe a hair better. A lot of the fabricators that we talk to are saying their business is up, you know, a couple points relative to kind of a normal rate.

So we feel good about that business, and, you know, it's been very for us through the years. And feel good about opportunities we have to improve our share position there as well.

Mark Weintraub: Thanks so much, and congrats both again.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you. Thanks, Mark.

Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Kurt Yinger with D. A. Davidson. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Kurt Yinger: Great. Thanks, and congrats, Jason and Brad. I just wanted to go back to some of the comments just around the fourth quarter Siding volumes. Could you just talk about I mean, what you're hearing from your customers? In terms of maybe a little bit of demand degradation? And then how you know, perhaps managing inventory levels and the price increase factored in if at all?

Jason Ringblum: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. You know, what I've I guess I said this earlier, but, I mean, the process is very consistent with what we've done in prior years. You know, we look at historical purchases, kinda where demand is trending, and then come up with allocations for our distributor partners. And then obviously work with them closely through that process. If they're communicating that they're gonna short a customer on the other end, by no means will we hold them to that allocation specifically. So it is pretty fluid in nature. With the end goal being not to increase channel inventories as we go into the New Year and work through a price increase.

So far, yeah, I think that's been well received. And, you know, there are customers that, you are certainly asking for more. But that's something that we closely manage on a week-to-week basis.

Kurt Yinger: Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking forward to 2026 a little bit, I mean, what areas of deciding portfolio do you maybe have the highest conviction or visibility to at this stage in terms of delivering kind of above market growth and continuing the momentum? And separately, from a marketing or channel standpoint, kinda what do you most focused on there in terms of you know, strengthening your position, with different channel partners and whatnot? Thank you.

Jason Ringblum: I'll take that one as well. Know, what I would say is, you know, we've got very focused segment strategies for new construction repair, remodel, and then off-site, which includes shed, and manufactured housing segment. And those are three segments that we will be relentlessly focused on improving our share position in. And we're investing resources in all three pretty equally, maybe a little bit heavier in repair remodel. But we feel like there's an opportunity to continue to take, you know, a half point to a point of share of the addressable market on an annual basis as we think about the future.

Operator: Okay. Standby for our next question, please. The next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Adam Baumgarten: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Finish, can you kind of update us on where margins are there? Especially with the managed order file currently?

Alan Haughie: Margins still have that there. Good, but they still have a long way to go. Under this current circumstances. So, again, I still see both outsized We've certainly had outsized price increases on expert So there's nothing but opportunity there.

Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Alan Haughie: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. Our last call comes from the line of Steven Ramsey. Steven's with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Catherine Thompson: Hi. This is Catherine Thompson in for Steven today. Thank you for including me on the Q and A today. Answered, you know, many, many good questions, but wanted to follow-up just on a few on expert finish and have been taking some share gains. But I suppose for the quarter and as you think about the year, can you parse out the drivers between channel versus winning shelf space and end market demand. And then against the second part of this is against a pretty challenging R&R market, how sustainable do you feel these market share gains are on a go forward basis?

Jason Ringblum: I'll take that one, Catherine. So we're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in expert finish after getting into the prefinished business. I think it was back in 2020. We are on a managed order file right now, but we have incremental capacity coming online at the '1, early Q2 next year. In the neighborhood of 50 million to 70 million feet. We believe that we've got a very strong value prop with our expert finish line and, you know, have only added to that with the naturals collection that was launched in April. And that repair remodel contractors really enjoy using that product. So we think the demand is sticky.

Obviously, you need to get the contractor to get placement in the channel with our dealer partners. That's really our focus going forward is getting downstream as much as possible to pull that demand through for our dealer partners.

Alan Haughie: Catherine, I'll just add to Jason's answer that the keep in mind that our market share in that segment is tiny. Relative to the opportunity And as our product gets accepted, as Jason mentioned, as contractors, get to use, and as you mentioned, as we secure shelf space with the one-step distribution network, There's just a ton of upside in our ability to continue to grow that expert finish line. And, you know, have a higher a much higher market share of a large repair and remodel market.

Catherine Thompson: Yeah. And do you need to step up marketing expenses next year to keep being that share gainer, or are there other ways beyond to increase stickiness?

Jason Ringblum: Marketing is a big component.

Alan Haughie: So you're gonna yours it's in it's in home selling. To consumers primarily And so as a you know, if you parse our sales and marketing budget, particularly the marketing budget, it is skewed toward support of the repair and remodel segment more than any other segment by a pretty large margin. But I think what you'll see next year in our budgeting will be consistent or with our guidance will be consistent with the kind of span we've had historically, especially if you look a percent of revenue or anything like that.

Catherine Thompson: And since you brought up distribution, given the ongoing changes and the landscape in The US are you seeing any type of behavior changes for you as a supplier to the distribution market given some of the fundamental changes in distribution?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I would say right now, know, we're very pleased with the partners we have from a two-step distribution perspective and that, you know, those relationships are on very solid footing and you know, we look forward to continuing to work with our partners, but no real significant disruption. No.

Catherine Thompson: Okay. Great. Thanks so much, and best of luck. And congratulations.

Alan Haughie: Thank you, Catherine.

Operator: Moment, please. One additional question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Trist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Michael Roxland: Yeah. Thanks, Brad, Alan, Jason, Aaron for taking my questions, and I'll just echo what everybody else has said. Brad, congrats on your upcoming retirement. Well deserved. And, Jason, congrats on the new role. A lot of my questions have been addressed, but I just wanted to ask if you guys if you could give us some more color around volume growth by end market in terms of single-family R&R and sheds and manufactured housing in 3Q? And how should we think about Siding volume growth as we look into 2026? I know it was asked recently, but just trying to get a sense whether you think volumes will be flat, slightly up next year versus low single digits? Thanks.

Jason Ringblum: So I'll touch on the first part of the question. Just looking at Q3 versus prior year by segment, As I mentioned earlier, even though shed volume came off slightly versus Q2, It was up over year over year more than the other two segments. Repair remodel was second strongest, as evidenced by our performance in our expert finish business or line. And then single-family, I think it was a mixed bag.

You know, we had decent volume in some of our core markets, but in the Southern markets that are dominated a little bit more by the big builder know, and are stressed by some affordability challenges and just consumer confidence in general, we have that was our weakest segment in the quarter.

Alan Haughie: I'm gonna address the second question briefly. It's I think it's too early for us to make a sort of convincing call on 2026. As you know, we have pretty good visibility within a quarter and when we get to February, what we see within the first quarter behavior will, of course, color our view of 2026, at which point we'll provide some full-year guidance.

Michael Roxland: Understood. And then just one quick follow-up. If you see houses in rebound more quickly next year than you're now expecting, what levers do you have available to meet that increased side demand now that you're pushing out some of your capital projects?

Alan Haughie: Plenty of capacity. We can add shifts in existing facilities. So, yeah, we will have no problem responding to almost any imaginable demand scenario over the next couple of years. In either of our businesses or South America.

Michael Roxland: Got it, guys. Thank you.

Alan Haughie: Yeah. Thank you.

Michael Roxland: You're welcome. Thank you.

Operator: This does conclude the question and answer session. Would now like to turn the call back to Aaron for closing remarks.

Aaron Howald: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We'll look forward to continuing the conversation and follow-up calls later today and throughout the quarter. Thank you very much.",https://cdn.content.foolcdn.com/images/1umn9qeh/production/b4204f36ed605fc54d4ba32e2cb31d1dd892afd6-800x450.jpg?w=800&h=450,N,,2025-11-06 10:20:20.007426

The initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance energy reliability, support clean power goals, and expand investments across the region.

“We’re making a significant investment in battery storage because we see it as a critical part of Minnesota’s energy future,” said Bria Shea, President of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. “Batteries help us store energy when it’s inexpensive to produce and dispatch it when needed, allowing us to continue delivering reliable electricity to customers while keeping bills low.”

Key Project Components

The proposal, filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC), includes several major developments:

Sherco Energy Hub (Becker, MN)

Expansion of previously approved battery storage from 300 MW to 600 MW.

The Sherco coal plant, adjacent to the site, is set to retire by 2030.

Blue Lake Facility (Shakopee, MN)

Addition of 135.5 MW of battery storage capacity.

Sherco Solar Expansion (Clear Lake Township, MN)

Installation of a new 200 MW solar array, further strengthening renewable integration.

Construction Timeline and Technology

If approved, construction is scheduled to begin in 2026, with operations starting by late 2027.

The projects will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology, known for its safety, durability, and efficiency. LFP batteries can deliver four-hour discharge cycles and recharge quickly, supporting daily grid operations.

These batteries will reuse existing grid connections, enabling storage and distribution of energy generated from Xcel’s wind, solar, nuclear, and natural gas facilities across the Upper Midwest.

Economic and Community Impact

The new energy storage facilities are expected to bring substantial economic benefits:

Sherco Projects:

Over 150 union construction jobs.

Approximately $200 million in local tax payments.

Blue Lake Project:

Around 55 construction jobs.

About $60 million in local tax payments.

“For half a century, LIUNA members have kept the lights on in Minnesota by building and maintaining Sherco coal units,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager, Laborers’ International Union of North America – Minnesota and North Dakota. “Now, we’re proud to help transform it into a clean energy hub—supporting Minnesota’s climate goals while sustaining local jobs.”

Federal Tax Credits and Cost Savings

The projects are expected to qualify for federal clean energy tax credits, which will reduce project costs and benefit consumers directly:

Blue Lake Battery: 30% cost offset.

Sherco Battery and Solar Projects: 40% cost offset (qualifying as an energy community).

Xcel Energy has committed to passing these savings directly to customers in the form of lower electricity bills.

Clean Energy Fuels’ recent earnings call conveyed a positive sentiment, highlighting significant financial growth and strategic advancements in renewable natural gas (RNG) production and downstream fueling segments. Despite challenges such as net losses and slow adoption in the heavy-duty trucking sector, the company demonstrated resilience and optimism for future developments.

Strong Financial Performance

Clean Energy Fuels reported a robust financial performance for the third quarter of 2025, with revenues reaching $106 million, marking an 8% increase over the previous year when excluding alternative fuel tax credits. The company’s adjusted EBITDA stood at $17.3 million, reflecting its strong operational capabilities and financial management.

RNG Production Expansion

The company made significant strides in expanding its RNG production capabilities by initiating operations at its two largest dairy RNG projects located in Texas and Idaho. This expansion brings the total number of projects in operation to eight, underscoring Clean Energy Fuels’ commitment to scaling its renewable energy initiatives.

Transit and Refuse Business Growth

Clean Energy Fuels’ downstream fueling business continues to thrive, with steady contributions from the transit and refuse segments. The company’s success in this area is bolstered by its long-standing relationships with key customers, ensuring a reliable revenue stream.

Hydrogen Fueling Station Contracts

In a strategic move to diversify its offerings, Clean Energy Fuels secured contracts to design, build, and maintain hydrogen fueling stations for Foothill Transit and the cities of Riverside and Ventura. This development positions the company as a leader in the growing hydrogen fuel market.

Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions Launch

Partnering with Cummins and Hexagon Agility, Clean Energy Fuels launched Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions, focusing on low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles. This initiative aims to promote the adoption of next-generation compressed natural gas (CNG) trucks, aligning with the company’s sustainability goals.

GAAP Net Loss

Despite its successes, Clean Energy Fuels reported a GAAP net loss of $23.8 million for Q3 2025, compared to a $18.2 million loss in 2024. This was largely due to the absence of $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credits and $3 million in net incremental costs.

Challenges with LCFS Credit Prices

The company continues to face challenges with Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit prices, which have impacted segment profitability. However, Clean Energy Fuels remains optimistic about improvements in credit prices by 2026, which could enhance future profitability.

Slow Adoption of X15N Engine

The adoption of the Cummins X15N engine has been slower than anticipated, hindered by challenging freight rates and uncertain policy regulations in the heavy-duty trucking sector. This has posed a challenge for Clean Energy Fuels in expanding its market share in this segment.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, Clean Energy Fuels remains optimistic about its financial trajectory, with a strong balance sheet boasting $232 million in cash and short-term investments. The company has raised its guidance for 2025, driven by the sale of 61 million gallons of RNG and the competitive advantages of RNG, such as low NOx and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the company anticipates positive impacts from the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and ongoing projects with Maas Energy Works.

In conclusion, Clean Energy Fuels’ earnings call reflected a positive outlook, with the company achieving significant financial growth and strategic advancements in RNG production and downstream fueling. Despite facing challenges, the company’s forward-looking guidance and strategic initiatives position it well for future success.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Energy-7-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 00:02:08.247238

For the third quarter, Rivian reported revenues of $1.55 billion, slightly exceeding Bloomberg consensus estimates of $1.49 billion.
Despite the revenue growth, Rivian reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was better than the estimated loss of $0.71.
In a statement, CEO RJ Scaringe emphasized the progress made in the third quarter, outlining the company’s strategic objectives, which include the development of the R2 vehicle and advancements in their technology roadmap.

This comes at a time when the electric vehicle manufacturer faces challenges, such as the reduction of federal electric vehicle tax credits, while also positioning itself for future growth with its upcoming midsize SUV model.

For the third quarter, Rivian reported revenues of $1.55 billion, slightly exceeding Bloomberg consensus estimates of $1.49 billion. This marks a remarkable 78% increase compared to the same quarter last year, driven in part by a surge in deliveries. As a result, Rivian’s stock jumped 14% in early trading on Wednesday.

Despite the revenue growth, Rivian reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was better than the estimated loss of $0.71. However, the company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $602 million, which was slightly higher than the $570.7 million that analysts had expected. Notably, Rivian recorded a gross profit of $24 million, ending a streak of losses and achieving its goal of profitability in this area after two consecutive quarters.

Additionally, Rivian maintained its full-year loss projection amid ongoing trade disputes and the discontinuation of the electric vehicle tax credits, which pose challenges for the business. The company reiterated its adjusted full-year EBITDA loss estimate for 2025, projecting a range between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, along with capital expenditures expected to fall between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.

In a statement, CEO RJ Scaringe emphasized the progress made in the third quarter, outlining the company’s strategic objectives, which include the development of the R2 vehicle and advancements in their technology roadmap. He expressed confidence in Rivian’s integrated technologies and direct-to-consumer ownership experience, which he believes position the brand for success in both U.S. and European markets.

Earlier in the month, Rivian reported production of 10,720 vehicles and deliveries of 13,201 for the third quarter, aligning with expectations of a strong quarter. The company has also narrowed its delivery guidance for 2025 to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, adjusting down from a previous range of 40,000 to 46,000. Rivian’s initial target for 2025 was set between 46,000 and 51,000 vehicles.

Central to Rivian’s anticipated sales growth is the development of the R2 midsize crossover, which is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. Rivian has reported that all production areas for the R2 are operational, with equipment installations for body shop lines completed, and plans to start manufacturing validation builds by the end of the year. Upgrades to the paint shop have further enhanced manufacturing capacity to 215,000 units per year.

Analysts have responded positively to Rivian’s announcements, particularly concerning the R2’s development. Dan Ives from Wedbush indicated optimism regarding Rivian’s long-term vision, noting the company is navigating substantial macroeconomic challenges while gearing up for the ramp-up of its R2 and midsize platform supply chains, as well as improvements in autonomous capabilities.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rivian-Stock-Surges-After-Q3-Results-Beat-Estimates-and-R2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:17.170702

Heavy industry is the foundation of modern society. We need materials like cement, steel, and aluminum more than ever to rebuild our bridges and roads, construct wind and solar projects, and manufacture electric vehicles and heat pumps that will undergird our future. But industry needs a second revolution. For as much as industry made the middle class and ushered in a remarkable era of prosperity for many, it also threatens our climate, reinforces environmental racism, wastes valuable materials and energy, and leaves communities and workers behind.

At Industrious Labs, our mission is to set into motion unstoppable policies, people power, and analysis to make a triple impact on climate, justice, and jobs that drastically reduce dangerous emissions, and make industry accountable to communities and workers.

About the Position

Policymakers today at the federal and state levels are putting into place a policy agenda that will make renewable energy more expensive and harder to build, threatening progress on industrial decarbonization and the clean energy transition. This pushback against clean energy development – despite clean energy being the fastest to deploy at scale and with competitive prices – coincides with increasing electricity rates, in part driven by data centers demanding electricity at nearly any price.

As a result, advocates have a critical opportunity: large electricity buyers are aghast at rapidly inflating electricity prices, and they are well positioned to carry the message to statehouses and Public Utility Commissions that now is the time to accelerate development of renewable energy.

We seek a highly organized, motivated Senior Campaign Strategist to join our team. Industrious Labs is fully remote, and you’ll report to Aluminum Campaign Director Annie Sartor. Periodic domestic travel is expected (2-4 times per year). This public-facing role best suits an enthusiastic relationship-builder and clear communicator.

What You’ll Do

You’ll hold responsibilities that will evolve over time as the team grows and functions are distributed. During your first year, responsibilities may include:

Build and maintain relationships and regular communications with industrial and manufacturing industry representatives, starting with the existing relationships that Industrious Labs holds, and building an extensive network of industry contacts that share ambition for clean energy procurement.

Build and maintain relationships and regular communications with organizational partners, including those that focus on developing clean energy, supporting frontline communities, and advocating for family-supporting jobs.

Track and surface opportunities for industrial manufacturers to advocate for policies and projects that advance clean energy development in key industrial manufacturing states (including Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina and Michigan)

Support the Sustainable Aluminum Network’s efforts to decarbonize and transform the domestic primary aluminum industry by planning and facilitating regular meetings among partner organizations.

Support development of campaign strategy that integrates the organization’s strengths with a policy and power analysis.

Serve as a thought partner to other campaign team members.

Who You Are

You’re committed to Industrious Labs’ mission and values, and you bring a spirit of possibilities and an entrepreneurial spirit to what can sometimes feel like daunting campaign obstacles. You’re a strategic thinker, strong collaborator, and skilled campaigner who can work across lines of difference and lead with humility and purpose. You may not have a background in industrial transformation – though you may! – but you’re passionate about climate, justice and jobs, and your passion is infectious.

Core Qualifications

5-8 years of increasing responsibility in the field, with a proven campaigning and coalition-building track record.

Background or familiarity with the US power sector and/or with corporate engagement.

Experience working with and communicating effectively with external partners and managing professional relationship development.

Experience and comfort working in a virtual work environment.

Demonstrated ability to learn and master new concepts quickly.

Excellent project management skills and the ability to set priorities.

Preferred Qualifications

Experience advocating for development of clean power, via Public Utility Commissions or other venues.

Comfort in a matrixed work environment and skill with cross-functional collaboration.

Entrepreneurial spark – you’ve built things before and thrive in fast-moving, dynamic environments where you don’t have all the answers.

You’ve got opinions, not an ego – you’re someone who can lead a project and still laugh at your own typos.

Industrious Labs Core Qualifications

These are shared across all roles at Industrious Labs:.

Deep alignment with our mission, values, and goals.

Highly collaborative work style and service as a peer and thought partner.

Commitment to learning, curiosity, and personal growth.

Strong communication skills — able to break down complex issues into clear strategies and decisions.

Excited by the unknown and eager to build.

Proven leadership and commitment to equity, transparency, and team culture.

Demonstrated experience working across lines of race, class, gender, and geography.

Skill within a dynamic, fast-paced environment and moving between solo efforts and teamwork.

Openness to giving and receiving compassionate, direct feedback.

Salary and Benefits:

The salary for this position is $121,000. Industrious Labs has a policy not to negotiate salaries. Rather than rely on negotiation, we offer transparent pay aligned with experience, responsibilities, and organizational values.

We offer competitive benefits, including 100% employer-paid health coverage (medical, dental and vision), a work-from-home stipend, up to 5% 401k employer match, 11 paid holidays, and unlimited vacation (with a minimum of 15 business days).

""These bills are a waste of time, and they are dead on arrival,"" the office said in a statement.
""The governor has her veto pen ready to prevent these bills from destroying the economy.""
It could be an iteration of job-creation tax incentives Whitmer has unsuccessfully lobbied for in recent years.","LANSING — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vowed Wednesday to veto newly proposed bills that would abolish the Michigan Economic Development Corp., which is facing legislative scrutiny over its business-attraction efforts and its oversight of a controversial earmark.

The Democratic governor's office said the state ""is landing record job-creating investments"" and ""should keep our foot on the gas, not throw everything into reverse."" The House Republicans' MEDC plan, it said, ""would put a 'closed for business' sign at Michigan's border with Ohio and Indiana,"" killing jobs and closing small businesses.

""These bills are a waste of time, and they are dead on arrival,"" the office said in a statement. ""The governor has her veto pen ready to prevent these bills from destroying the economy.""

Republicans, who control the House, said the quasi-governmental agency that was created in 1999 is a failure regardless of lawmakers' differing views on whether they should replace it with something else or get out of the business of attracting and retaining companies.

""I do understand that we're not always in complete alignment throughout the political spectrum. But what is abundantly clear is the MEDC has failed the taxpayers of Michigan, it has failed our state, it has failed our small businesses and it is at the expense of the people, the hard-working middle class,"" Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers, said during a news conference with other Republicans.

Rep. Jay DeBoyer, a Republican from St. Clair County's Clay Township, said the ""experiment is over,"" taking aim at how the state used the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to commit billions of dollars to projects and jobs that he said have not come to fruition.

Legislators, including Democrats, recently stopped a final $500 million deposit into the account, declined to reauthorize automatic annual SOAR funding and cut funds for other MEDC programs. House Speaker Matt Hall has since said that Republicans want to repeal SOAR, which has a balance of $607 million that has not been obligated and will grow by up to $175 million following the death a planned electric vehicle battery components factory near Big Rapids.

The fund was tapped to support EV battery and other projects with critical industry and strategic site readiness grants. Some high-profile projects, including plants planned by Gotion Inc. and Our Next Energy, are dead or their future is in question.

As part of the 2025-26 budget deal, Hall and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks agreed to pass by year's end unspecified economic development legislation that would make it easier to retain and attract jobs. It could be an iteration of job-creation tax incentives Whitmer has unsuccessfully lobbied for in recent years.

MEDC spokesperson Danielle Emerson defended the agency's track record.

In the 2024-25 fiscal year, she said, ""the MEDC's programs and services trained and placed more than 5,950 workers and more than 1,480 interns in good-paying jobs; helped more than 2,000 new businesses start up; and helped small businesses secure roughly $2.77 billion in new revenue. Our MBDP program has a more than 80% success rate, as touted by economists, and our Small Business Support Hubs have been lauded for helping everyday citizens access resources to start a business, minimize supply chain cost through peer-to-peer networking and local contracts, and create solutions in real time all at little-to-no-cost to them — all while keeping business dollars here in Michigan.

The USDA Forest Service and other fire management agencies around the world have used phosphate-based fire retardants for more than 60 years to prevent the spread of wildfires. Over that time, fire retardant has proven to be an effective tool, helping firefighters to protect thousands of structures from destruction and to save countless lives. It has also helped to protect the environment from the far-reaching and sometimes irreversible damages caused by wildfires.

In this article we will examine more than 80 years of scientific research that has determined that phosphate is the safest, most effective fire retardant available. We will also explore the potential environmental consequences of not using fire retardants, and why tools like PHOS-CHEK® are more important than ever as we face longer, more intense wildfire seasons.

One of the earliest tests of chemical fire retardants took place at the University of Idaho in 1940.1 Researchers evaluated seven chemicals for their ability to reduce combustibility in sawdust using a modified fire-tube apparatus. Diammonium phosphate proved most effective, followed by borax, zinc chloride, and others.

In 1954, the U.S. Forest Service launched Operation Firestop, the first major study of chemical firefighting effectiveness.2 Conducted at Camp Pendleton, the study tested various chemicals for their impact on wood ignition time, fire intensity, and flame suppression. Ammonium phosphate was again identified as among the most effective.3 The results from these tests led to phosphate-based retardants becoming the industry standard, and PHOS-CHEK eventually became the first fire retardant approved for aerial firefighting. Less effective chemicals were discarded for long-term use.

Sixteen years later, University of Montana scientist Aylmer D. Blakely expanded on Firestop’s findings in his 1970 paper A Laboratory Method for Evaluating Forest Fire Retardant Chemicals. Using a “superiority factor” based on weight loss, burn residue, and heat radiation, Blakely ranked the effectiveness of additional chemicals.4 Diammonium and monoammonium phosphate, again, outperformed others across all parameters, reinforcing phosphate’s status as the most effective retardant chemistry and solidifying PHOS-CHEK’s position as the preferred solution.

A more recent study, conducted in 2022 and co-funded by Australia’s Department of Energy, Environment, and Climate Action (DEECA) and the Victorian Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions took a different approach, comparing the effectiveness of wildfire retardants against water alone, and an untreated control using four different assessment methods:

Direct suppression test: Determining retardant effectiveness when applied directly onto burning fuels like a suppressant.

Indirect suppression test: Examining the ability of retardants to slow or stop fire spread when applied indirectly onto unburnt fuels in the path of a fire front.

Longevity test: Investigating the ability of retardant treated fuels to resist ignition pressure from flaming point ignition sources over time.

Coverage level test: Comparing the ability of fuels treated with different retardant depths to resist flaming firebrands.5

The “indirect suppression test” was considered the most important in evaluating the effectiveness of retardant, because this is how retardants are typically used in battling wildfire. Two different retardants were compared to water and the untreated control, with effectiveness of each measured by its ability to stop or slow the fire spread, the percentage of the treatment area burned, and the change in fire forward spread rate within the treatment.6

Retardant treatments outperformed water and untreated controls in all fire resistance measures, with significantly lower area burned and shorter fire penetration distances. Retardant A consistently resisted fire spread more effectively than Retardant B, and penetration distance emerged as the most reliable indicator of performance.

The Case for PHOS-CHEK

Organizations have recently expressed concerns about the use of fire retardant to battle wildfire citing the presence of heavy metals in fire retardants. However, it is important to note that no heavy metals are intentionally added to PHOS-CHEK. The active ingredient in PHOS-CHEK is diammonium phosphate (DAP), which is used to make food products such as beer, wine, cheese, and bread. Exposure to PHOS-CHEK is minimal, as it is typically applied in remote, forested areas. Meanwhile, the consequences of uncontrolled wildfire are immediate, widespread, and well-documented.

To illustrate the scale of the environmental impact, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reported that global wildfires in 2021 emitted approximately 1.76 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.7 For perspective, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO₂ per year.8 This is equivalent to the annual CO₂ emissions of more than 382 million passenger vehicles. Notably, 2021 wasn’t even considered a particularly active wildfire year. It didn’t rank among the top 15 years for total burned acreage in the United States over the past six decades.

Added to the environmental challenges presented with CO₂ emissions, air quality concerns are heightened with the release of other toxins from wildfires. With the expansion of the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), wildfires are now threatening more urban areas, evident in the destructive Los Angeles fires of January 2025. The wildfire smoke from these urban fires is more dangerous than smoke from forest fires due to the variety of materials that burn, including vehicles, plastics, batteries, and building materials. When burned, these items release particulate matter and toxic chemicals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other toxins that are dangerous to breathe.

One of the most concerning pollutants from wildfire is particulate matter (PM2.5), fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less are up to ten times more harmful to human health than PM2.5 from other sources.9

These particles can travel great distances as witnessed during the 2023 and 2025 Canadian wildfires, which led to low air quality alerts across the United States. Among other health ailments, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires led to a marked increase in the number of people being seen for asthma-related symptoms in New York City emergency departments.10 Meanwhile, researchers from Kidney International Reports found that the air pollution created by the wildfires resulted in increased risk of mortality and hospitalization among hemodialysis patients in the Eastern and Midwestern United States.11

Beyond the negative air quality impacts, wildfires also lead to large amounts of heavy metals being deposited in the soil and surrounding waterways, and these effects can last for years. Researchers from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) compared water quality before and after a wildfire event occurred and found that wildfires could increase the presence of many pollutants in water by two orders of magnitude. Nutrients and suspended solids concentrations increased within a year after the fire, while peaks in heavy metal contamination didn’t occur until one-to-two years following the wildfire.12

Wildfires also release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are semi-volatile organic compounds composed of two or more fused benzene rings bounded in linear, cluster, or angular arrangements. 13 They are absorbed into soil following a fire, due to the soil’s lower vapor pressure and higher hydrophobicity (its ability to repel water).14 Burnt ash from wildfire contains high concentrations of PAHs, a known carcinogen, which leaches into burnt soil. Erosion carries the contaminated sediment to nearby soils, deteriorating the soil quality, and PAHs then enter into crops through plant uptake.15

Stanford and Colorado State University researchers conducted additional testing on the effects of wildfires on soil chemistry, finding that they can impact water contamination and plant growth, and that they can also alter the chemical properties of metals in the soil.16 Specific to chromium, the report stated that there were higher levels of a hazardous form of chromium that are created as a result of a heat-induced transformation. Wildfires literally cook the soil, and this highly toxic form of chromium created as a result remains in the soil until the next large rain event.17

Other long-term environmental impacts from wildfire include increased flooding and water contamination from soil erosion, reduced carbon storage capacity due to vegetation loss, and lasting harm to ecosystems and biodiversity from habitat destruction and invasive species.

A Necessary Tool for a Changing Climate

As wildfires grow in size, frequency, and intensity, their environmental toll is becoming impossible to ignore. The damage caused to the environment is not short-term, they linger for years, affecting public health, biodiversity, and climate resilience.

Phosphate-based fire retardants like PHOS-CHEK are not only scientifically proven to be the most effective tools for slowing or stopping wildfires, but they are also a critical line of defense in protecting the planet from the much greater environmental harm that wildfires cause.

In an era of increasingly extreme fire behavior, we cannot afford to leave our most effective tools unused.

These bills would require high-earning entities in the fashion industry to monitor and report activities related to their supply chains, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, and chemical management.

The proposed bills are largely consistent on key provisions related to scope, environmental due diligence, monitoring and reporting requirements, performance targets, and enforcement mechanisms. If enacted, these bills will significantly impact due diligence and reporting requirements and have the potential to influence long-term business strategy in the fashion industry.

Scope

The bills target “fashion sellers” doing business in the relevant state. A fashion seller is broadly defined to mean any business entity that sells apparel, footwear, or fashion bags and whose annual gross receipts exceed $100 million. Notably, multi-brand retailers are included in this definition when annual gross receipts of all private labels under the retailer exceed $100 million.

Environmental Due Diligence

Each proposed bill would require fashion sellers to implement extensive environmental due diligence measures, including supply chain mapping and disclosure and risk identification and mitigation, in compliance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED) Due Diligence Guidelines. In practice, these proposed conditions would require fashion sellers to:

Monitor their supply chains throughout a product’s life, from start to finish

Disclose identifying information about suppliers and subcontractors over time

Embed responsible business conduct into policies and contracting practices

Assess and respond to environmental-related risks

All information related to a fashion seller’s due diligence activities would be recorded in a due diligence report and annually disclosed publicly, on the fashion seller’s website and to the appropriate regulator.

Reporting Requirements

As proposed, the fashion accountability bills would require fashion sellers to report their GHG emissions, water usage, and chemical management.

GHG Emissions: Fashion sellers would have to annually report GHG emissions in accordance with certain global standards.

Water Use and Chemical Management: Under the Massachusetts and New York bills, fashion sellers would have significant reporting duties related to Tier 2[1] dyeing, finishing, printing, and garment washing suppliers. Specifically, fashion sellers would have to sample and report wastewater chemical concentrations and water usage, report chemical inventory, and verify the supplier’s compliance with local chemical concentrations. If appropriate, the fashion seller would also have to report chemical concentrations of wastewater treatment facilities, report the percentage of their suppliers that have chemical remediation plans in place, and disclose their internal remediation plan.

Performance Targets

The proposed bills in California, Massachusetts, and New York would require fashion sellers to establish and meet short- and long-term GHG emission reduction targets. These targets would apply to scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and would have to align with relevant regulations and comply with certain global standards. Fashion sellers who do not meet their emission reduction targets would be out of compliance and subject to civil penalties, unless they are able to comply within the specified timeframe.

Regulated Chemicals

Under the California bills, fashion sellers would be prohibited from selling covered fashion items that contain certain chemicals above specified thresholds. The Washington bill would require reporting on products that contain priority chemicals.

Enforcement

Under the proposed bills, enforcement power is given to the state attorney general and certain state agencies (together “Regulators”). Regulators would be responsible for investigating and enforcing each bill. If the Regulators find that a fashion seller is non-compliant or otherwise violates the bill, civil fines would be imposed. Depending on the jurisdiction, these fines could be up to 2 percent of the fashion seller’s annual revenue, $15,000 per day per violation, or $10,000 per violation. Fines would then be deposited in environmental funds created by the proposed bills to fund environmental benefit or remediation projects.

Conclusion

If enacted, the proposed bills will impose significant due diligence responsibilities on the fashion industry. We will continue to monitor this issue in 2026 because the 2025 legislative sessions in California, New York, and Washington have now closed.

On Day 1 of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy canceled billions of dollars for Biden-era climate and energy projects. They say that the projects are wasteful. But as Colorado Public Radio's Ishan Thakore reports, recipients say the cuts are shortsighted.

HANK PRICE: Go ahead and walk out here.

ISHAN THAKORE, BYLINE: Yeah.

PRICE: It's more interesting once we get out...

THAKORE: In a grassy field near the Denver Airport, Hank Price is showing off a massive, roughly three-story collection of curved mirrors. It's called the SunBeam, and it's a demo for a technology called concentrating solar power.

PRICE: This is a low-cost way of making solar power at night.

THAKORE: Price says the SunBeam is different from your average solar farm. It uses the sun to generate heat, which can be stored to make electricity later, even after dark.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

President Trump's claim of unilateral power to impose tariffs across the globe hit a wall of skepticism at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Over the course of an argument that lasted almost three hours, both the court's conservatives and liberals seemed doubtful about the legal authority underpinning Trump's signature economic policy.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer, representing Trump, was first up to the lectern, telling the court that Trump imposed the tariffs to deal with two dire emergencies: a persistent trade imbalance and the flood of fentanyl entering the United States.

But the justices were openly doubtful about the president's claim that he has the power to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, known as IEEPA, a statute that, as Chief Justice John Roberts observed, says nothing about tariffs.

Sauer replied that the statute's terms are ""capacious,"" not restrictive, and that Trump has inherent authority as president, under the Constitution, to deal with these national security and foreign affairs threats.

Roberts acknowledged that tariffs involve foreign affairs. But he noted that the statute, as interpreted by Trump, imposes taxes on Americans, and taxes have always been ""the core power of Congress.""

Under your theory, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, President Biden could have declared an emergency under global warming, and that would have been enough to justify his environmental policy.

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked, ""Can you to point to any other place in the code or any time in history where the phrase…'regulate importation' [the words in the statute] has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?""

When Sauer repeated that emergency situations justify the Trump tariffs, Justice Elena Kagan replied caustically, ""It turns out, we're in emergencies…all the time, about, like, half the world.""

Justice Neil Gorsuch posed perhaps the most vociferous challenge to the solicitor general, contending that the president's position in essence, could cover anything, including the power to declare war specifically given to Congress in the Constitution.

""You're saying inherent authority in foreign affairs, all foreign affairs, to regulate commerce, duties, and tariffs and war. Its inherent authority all the way down, you say. Fine,"" he said. ""Congress decides tomorrow, well, we're tired of this legislating business. We're just going to hand it all off to the president. What would stop Congress from doing that?""

Sauer replied that the court in past opinions has said that the president's powers apply with ""much less force, more limited force.""

Indeed, he said that Congress can always change the law, and take back the power he claims it ceded under the IEEPA statute. But Gorsuch wasn't buying the argument, noting that even if Congress passed a new law, the president could veto it, and it would take a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to override the veto and prevail.

""As a practical matter,"" said Gorsuch, that would be impossible. ""Congress can't get its power back once it is handed over to the president.""

Next up to the lectern was lawyer Neal Katyal, representing those challenging the Trump tariffs. He noted that IEEPA has been in existence for 50 years and no other president has ever claimed that the statute grants him such unilateral power. Katyal got some tough questions from the justices, particularly about why the words in the law calling for the regulation of imports and licensing fees are not tariffs.

But the hardest question came from Justice Barrett, and that was about how to return the billions of dollars already paid by U.S. businesses in order to comply with the Trump tariffs.

""If you win, tell me how the reimbursement would work,"" asked Barrett. You said before that ""the government promised reimbursement…How would that work? It seems to me like it could be a mess.""

Katyal said there would be a variety of options, prompting this from Barrett: ""So a mess.""

A decision in the case could come more quickly than usual because both sides asked the court to expedite consideration of the case.

During the next five years, the city is authorized by City Council to invest up to $12 million to continue the collaboration — originally launched in 2020 — and extend it to five additional Central Texas institutions: Austin Community College, Concordia University Texas, St. Edward’s University, Huston-Tillotson University and Texas State University.

Since its inception, the UT-City partnership has launched nearly 60 projects that are turning research into practical results for Austinites — advancing work in climate resilience, transportation safety, public health, housing and more. Together, UT and the City have streamlined project administration through a master Interlocal Agreement (ILA), reducing contracting time and making it easier for researchers and city staff to collaborate.

“The successes and insights gained over the last five years have delivered measurable outcomes and opened the doors for an expanded ecosystem,” said Charles Purma, Program Manager for the City of Austin. “Our partnership is driving significant benefits across research advancement, operational efficiency, policy innovation and community impact.”

City leaders say the expanded alliance marks an important next step in regional collaboration — uniting a wide range of academic expertise to address complex civic challenges through data-driven, interdisciplinary approaches. Already, other cities and agencies have expressed interest in replicating Austin’s model, which has emerged as a compelling example of how research partnerships can accelerate municipal innovation and improve community outcomes.

According to the City of Austin, standout projects include:

Upgraded Emergency Preparedness and Guidance

UT researchers Lucy Atkinson and Junfeng Jiao are leading a three-phase interdisciplinary project exploring how artificial intelligence can deliver real-time emergency guidance across multiple languages, particularly for residents whose primary language is not English or Spanish. Across three studies, the team is testing which message strategies are most effective at engaging audiences and promoting disaster preparedness and response.

Atkinson, an associate professor in the Stan Richards School of Advertising & Public Relations, contributes expertise in communication and AI strategy, while Jiao, an associate professor in the School of Architecture and director of UT’s Ethical AI research traineeship program, is developing the chatbot technology as part of the Good Systems Grand Challenge. Following data collection completed in February 2025, the team expects to finalize the AI chatbot by year’s end, pending city approval for integration into Austin’s emergency preparedness system.

Traffic Tech for Safer Intersections

Led by Natalia Ruiz Juri of the Center for Transportation Research, UT researchers partnered with the City of Austin to evaluate how advanced computing and video analytics can improve intersection safety. Using traffic camera footage, the team compared the accuracy of several emerging technologies for detecting vehicles, pedestrians and bicycles, and assessed their ability to identify safety risks such as near misses and red-light violations.

The project supported Austin’s Vision Zero goals — eliminating traffic-related fatalities — by revealing patterns in pedestrian movement and developing a framework to guide future technology-based traffic safety assessments, helping make Austin’s streets safer for everyone.

Forecasting and Preparing for Extreme Austin Weather

Created in 2023, the UT-City CoLab connects the City of Austin’s need for timely, actionable climate data with research expertise across geosciences, engineering, public affairs and planning. Led by Dev Niyogi, Patrick Bixler, Tim Keitt and Sergio Castellanos, the CoLab brings together city experts on climate adaptation and resilience; UT researchers from the Jackson School of Geosciences, LBJ School of Public Affairs, School of Architecture, College of Natural Sciences and the Cockrell School of Engineering; and local communities to integrate cutting-edge science with practical and evidence-based strategies for resilience.

Since its inception, the CoLab has updated Austin’s long-term climate projections, launched seasonal outlooks for summer and winter, and provided critical data to help city departments plan for and respond to extreme weather. Now in its third year, with sustained City funding and new research investments, the CoLab is advancing projects on forest health and wildfire risk, integrating climate data into building codes, developing and testing scenario planning tools for infrastructure and community health, and studying how “cooling corridors” can reduce heat impacts.

Together, these efforts advance the City’s resilience goals and help translate University research into real-world climate solutions for Austin’s future.

Data-Driven Solutions To Improve Homeless Services

Sherri Greenberg, a professor of practice at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, worked with the City of Austin’s Downtown Austin Community Court (DACC) to assess the design, implementation and outcomes of its homeless services program, Intensive Case Management, which has reduced repeat interactions with the justice system among the population it serves.

The DACC uses a person-centered, housing-focused case management model to help people experiencing homelessness achieve long-term stability. Greenberg and DACC also co-developed a sustainable, scalable community platform to improve access to legal, mental health and substance use services while equipping service providers with better data to support lasting change.

Currently in early planning stages, the second phase of this project will evaluate and enhance DACC’s federally funded Mobile Court initiative, which runs through 2028.

Ecological Stewardship at Balcones Canyonlands Preserve

Since 2021, College of Natural Sciences research scientist Ed LeBrun has helped support the City of Austin’s obligations under the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan by addressing the threat of invasive tawny crazy ants to endangered species and sensitive habitats within the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a 33,000-acre system of preserves. Funded jointly by the City of Austin and Travis County, the project evaluates the ants’ impacts on endangered karst invertebrates and golden-cheeked warblers, tests biological control methods, and develops management strategies to protect native ecosystems. In addition to advancing understanding of tawny crazy ant ecology, the work provides critical data and training for City staff, helping inform long-term conservation and land management efforts.

The project also aligns with the City’s Strategic Direction 2023 goals (adopted in 2018) to sustain Austin’s parks, open spaces and urban trail networks through evidence-based environmental stewardship.

Understanding the Neighborhood Impacts of Austin’s Land Use Policy Changes

Led by associate professor Herschel Thomas from the LBJ School of Public Affairs, researchers worked with the City of Austin to study how recent land use policy changes — including the HOME 1 and HOME 2 initiatives — are reshaping the city’s neighborhoods. The project is evaluating how these policies affect housing production, affordability, demographic composition and neighborhood mobility, with a focus on understanding who benefits and who may be displaced as Austin grows. By comparing Austin’s experience with that of similar cities, the research aims to help city officials assess the effectiveness of land use reforms and develop a framework for ongoing evaluation. This work builds on the city’s Strategic Housing Blueprint and decades of rapid urban change, providing critical insight into how zoning and development policies can better support affordable housing for all residents.

Looking Ahead: The Next Chapter in a Proven Partnership

To celebrate the partnership’s achievements and chart the course for the future, a University Partnership Showcase is planned for December on UT’s main campus. The event will bring together representatives from all partner universities and highlight standout projects.

This will be the first time all partners gather publicly, marking a new chapter in regional collaboration. As the ecosystem grows, so does the potential for transformative impact across the region.

“Addressing Austin’s most complex civic challenges requires connecting research and innovation directly to the people we serve,” said Daniel Culotta, assistant director at Austin Budget and Organizational Excellence. “By grounding this expanded partnership in an approach intentionally focused on municipal purpose and residents, we’re not just generating new ideas — we’re translating them into sustainable products, services and policies that cities can adopt to deliver better outcomes for all.”

As China’s “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” agenda enters its fifth year, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the International Society for Energy Transition Studies (ISETS) conducted their annual expert survey to systematically summarise current progress and assess future trends. For the fourth annual edition of CREAʼs Chinaʼs Climate Transition Outlook, CREA surveyed a pool of 68 experts representing diverse specialisations in the fields of climate and energy. The survey targets experts, scholars, and practitioners to compare data since 2022, capture changes across key sectors and critical issues, and provide evidence-based insights and decision-making support for China’s “dual carbon” strategy.

The survey’s key findings include:

More than two-thirds (69%) of experts believe China will significantly or partly overachieve its new climate targets for 2035, which aim to reduce emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels, showing China can indeed achieve much higher reductions.

Yet, uncertainty about China’s short-term energy transition and industrial decarbonisation has increased following the announcement of the conservative 2035 NDC targets, amid economic uncertainties and geopolitical volatility.

Although emissions have fallen since March 2024, experts are less certain that China will peak in 2025, expecting a peak later in 2028. This also reflects the reluctance of the government to adopt a peaking year for its 2035 targets and could leave more room for emissions to grow.

Still, the majority of experts (99%) are confident that China will achieve its 2030 targets, implying no emissions growth over the coming five years. That’s even as the country is currently far off track for its interim 2025 targets on carbon intensity and controlling coal consumption growth.

The majority (80%) of experts believe that emissions in the steel and cement sectors have already peaked or will do so before 2030, despite a lag in China’s steel decarbonisation.

Despite economic uncertainties, experts are more confident that the current and future domestic economic and geopolitical environment will accelerate the short-term energy transition and strengthen the importance of the dual carbon goals, highlighting the importance of clean energy sectors for the economy.

Electricity bills are expected to be a key focus in next year’s midterm elections.
Power prices nationwide have increased 5.1 percent over the past year, outpacing inflation, according to the latest government data.
“Affordability was a big issue, and every ad she ran on prices she talked about energy prices,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO.
The president entered the White House with a promise to cut electricity prices in half.","That has given Democratic candidates an opening to pummel the GOP on affordability. And for now, voters appear to be listening.

“Electricity prices were a huge issue in Virginia and New Jersey,” said Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who chaired the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Trump’s first term. He also noted the drawbacks of the president’s decision to replace the GOP’s traditional “all of the above” energy messaging with an all-out attack on wind and solar power.

“If we’re gonna win the AI race and keep prices affordable we need all the electrons,” Chatterjee said. “All of the actions to cut clean energy make no sense and it’s totally counterproductive and voters took notice. There is plenty of time for Republicans to reverse course. But they need to get to it ASAP.”

Republican lawmakers acknowledged that surging power prices contributed to Democrats’ successes and said the GOP needs to push its own response.

“They [Democrats] pounded a message of affordability,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who is up for reelection in 2026. “And that’s a message that we’ve been working on.”

Though high power bills “definitely” played a role in Tuesday’s Democratic wins, she added that gasoline prices have fallen.

Electricity bills are expected to be a key focus in next year’s midterm elections. Power prices nationwide have increased 5.1 percent over the past year, outpacing inflation, according to the latest government data.

A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last month found electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36 percent of U.S. adults.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a moderate who is retiring rather than face reelection next year, downplayed the role of energy prices in an election that included only a few statewide races. But he warned Trump’s policies to phase out tax credits for solar and wind projects and impose permitting hurdles for renewable energy will lead to higher prices in the coming years.

“I do think we’ve got to look out,” Tillis said. “It’s two or three years before you’d see the bulk of it [further price increases], but we’ve got to get that right.”

Democrats on Tuesday won marquee gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, where moderates Abigail Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill both made affordability concerns and skyrocketing electricity bills central to their campaigns.

Power prices in Virginia — home to the nation’s highest concentration of data centers — have surged 13 percent in the past year, while New Jersey’s prices climbed 21 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. Both states have seen plans for huge new wind farms threatened by the Trump administration’s opposition to the technology.

Former Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called the election results a “referendum” on Trump’s energy policies.

“This is clearly a rejection across the country,” he said. “And all these races had one thing in common: Every Democrat was running against the Trump exposure to Americans with higher electrical bills.”

In Virginia, Spanberger promised to ensure data centers are paying their share of the power costs, while pursuing a generation mix that includes solar energy, offshore wind and nuclear power. A recent study showed power customers there had already shouldered $2 billion in extra power grid costs from those data centers.

“Affordability was a big issue, and every ad she ran on prices she talked about energy prices,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO. “So it did play a role.”

Sherrill similarly ran on a promise to freeze rates, bring in cleaner power generation and tie concerns about rate hikes to the utility grid operator. In her victory speech, Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on her first day to drive down utility costs.

“It’s all about affordability,” said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who called utility rates a “big” issue in both the Virginia and New Jersey races. “It all fits into the affordability framework where there’s an increasing awareness among the American people that Trump is blowing it.”

In Georgia’s contests for two seats on the Public Service Commission that regulates utility bills, two Democrats — Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — defeated Republican incumbents by calling for a transition to renewable power and guardrails around data center growth. Their wins were the first for Democrats in a Georgia non-federal statewide election in nearly two decades.

Hubbard told POLITICO ahead of the results that voters are keenly aware they’re paying too much and are frustrated by it.

“I’m benefiting from the fact that people are motivated to take action, especially with the incredible amount of nonsense coming out of the Trump administration,” he said.

“This is something where they can have agency and can take action to improve their lives at the state level.”

Georgia has emerged as a top solar power state in recent years, ranking No. 7 in the nation, according to the Solar Energies Industry Association.

Ahead of Election Day, Trump made repeated calls for voters to cast their ballots for Republicans if they wanted to see lower energy costs.

The president entered the White House with a promise to cut electricity prices in half. Since taking office, he’s pushed to grow production of oil, natural gas and coal while blocking new wind and solar development — energy sources the administration has derided as unreliable and sought to blame for rising electricity prices.

And while the factors behind electricity bills are complex and vary by state, the prices have exacerbated the inflation that has driven up overall costs. And experts predict electricity demand will surge in the coming years as technology companies rush to build a fleet of new data centers for artificial intelligence. That’s helped elevate utility bills to a political status typically reserved for gasoline prices.

“The issue of energy prices has taken on a different level of political attention,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “For years and years, gasoline prices had been understood to be a political issue. I think this is the first time we’re seeing electricity prices become a top three political issue.”

Some Republicans, however, dismissed Tuesday’s results as simply Democrats finding success motivating their voters in blue-leaning states, rather than dissatisfaction with Trump.

“The political class can’t help itself in reading whatever they want to read in election results, and we are certainly seeing that in the attempt to take away lessons about the electorate’s concern over electricity and energy prices. But that doesn’t seem to be a takeaway for this White House,” one person in the oil and gas industry, who interacts with the administration and was granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told POLITICO.

However, that person also conceded that concerns over the local impact of data centers in Virginia is a lesson for Republican lawmakers.

“I do think that the concerns over electricity demand provide an opening to mitigate some of the aggressiveness against solar and wind — with Republicans on the Hill,” the person said. “But I don’t expect a quiet revolt against the aggressively negative views of offshore wind coming from the White House.”

Republican Sen. Jon Husted of Ohio, who is expected to face a tough reelection race next year, argued that energy prices are being driven up by an inadequate supply of affordable energy, whether that is gas and diesel or electricity.

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal policies, closing all of these power plants, have been at the core of what is driving the supply-demand failure,” he said. “These are huge problems that have been unaddressed, made worse by the Biden administration, but now we have to rally ourselves to try to fix it.”

Alex Conant, a GOP strategist, also pressed that while it “was an ugly night for Republicans no matter how you look at it,” it wasn’t a referendum on Trump.

Instead, he said, “it is a reminder to the White House that they need to stay focused on the economy.”

Analysts said Wednesday the election results could actually trigger retaliation from Trump, including further cuts to federal funding for certain projects.

“[G]iven a Democrat is now in charge, we do think some investors will be wary as [to] whether the current U.S. Admin would take a tougher stance” on Virginia’s offshore wind project, for one, Barclays said in a memo.

Ishyan Veluppillai, an energy associate at analysis firm Capstone, agreed the administration was not likely to back off its anti-renewables push.

“It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to change their attitude toward wind and solar purely as a reaction to the election, even when they’re considering the potential of retaining the House in next year’s midterms,” he said. “I think you can very much expect to see the same sort of policies at [the Interior and Energy Departments] for the next year at least.”

Wayne D’Angelo, co-chair of the environmental law practice at the law firm Kelley Drye, said voters are clearly concerned about electricity prices, which will likely prompt Republican lawmakers to look for ways to take this issue off the table going forward.

“Whether it is in response to perceptions of strengthened public support for renewables or just pragmatism, I believe (or hope) that lawmakers will view the post-election period as a less politically perilous time to support energy projects of all types,” D’Angelo said in an email.

Environmental groups and Democrats, meanwhile, said Wednesday the results offered a strategy ahead of next year’s midterm elections for hammering Republicans on rising costs and their attacks on clean energy.

“This is a tremendous weapon to go after the Republicans,” Inslee said.

“It’s a winning issue. We’ve demonstrated this,” he added. “Why would we not use a winning issue when we demonstrated how powerful it is?”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F72%2Fef%2F33b7d6d64427866c9bfcf6d16fd6%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2245055015,N,,2025-11-05 20:02:56.512402

North Dakota Monitor reporter Michael Achterling can be reached at machterling@northdakotamonitor.com.","The federal government will allow the state of North Dakota to regulate the handling of waste from coal-burning power plants.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other officials announced Wednesday that the EPA has approved the state’s coal combustion residuals permit program.

Coal combustion residuals, or CCRs, are waste such as fly ash and other types of ash. Some can be recycled into concrete or wallboard.

Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven pointed to a bill he helped author to allow states to develop coal waste recycling programs.

Coal ash was used in the construction of the North Dakota Heritage Center and the National Energy Center of Excellence at Bismarck State College, according to the news release.

Fly ash also is a potential source of rare earth minerals.

“The potential to extract rare earth elements and critical minerals from CCR — instead of having to import them from foreign adversaries — makes this approval of our CCR permit program even more important to U.S. energy independence, the economy and national security,” Armstrong said.

North Dakota is the fourth state to be granted the permitting authority.

Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

The Dakota Resource Council is among the environmental groups opposed to state regulation of coal combustion residuals, saying North Dakota has a history of ignoring environmental issues.

Executive Director Scott Skokos called it “a free pass for coal companies to police themselves” in a news release.

Environmental groups say coal waste landfills can leak and pollute groundwater. Coal ash spills in Tennessee and North Carolina caused extensive environmental damage.

“Once groundwater is polluted, there’s no going back,” Skokos said.

Western North Dakota has five coal-fired power plants. The lignite coal industry supports about 12,000 jobs in North Dakota.

“This announcement demonstrates confidence in North Dakota’s leadership and technical expertise, reinforcing what we’ve long known: local knowledge and accountability lead to the best outcomes for both the environment and the economy,” Jonathan Fortner, president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, said in a statement.

Zeldin said the move helps cut red tape and puts more decision-making in the hands of the state, where it belongs.

“States should be more in charge of their own destiny,” Zeldin said.

Armstrong said the change gives North Dakota more control and flexibility.

“When you impose a federal regulation, 4,600 pages or otherwise … it’s almost impossible to change that if new technology comes out, or better technology comes out,” Armstrong said.

He said the change to state-level management of the coal waste will be “less restrictive, and more outcome-based.”

In an interview after the press conference, Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said North Dakota established a program to monitor coal waste in the 1990s. He said the state submitted its application for state authority during President Joe Biden’s administration.

“It’s just taken this long and, quite frankly, it shouldn’t have taken that long,” Glatt said. “When I talk to EPA now, they said it should’ve taken six months because we had a very well-established program that really checked off all the boxes.”

Glatt said he doesn’t see a need for much change to what the state is already doing, but the agency may have additional reporting requirements for the EPA. The department already inspects monitoring well sites near coal waste landfills several times per year, he said. He said the department will not need additional staff.

“I don’t think we’re going to need any more people, because we’ve already been at it for decades,” Glatt said

In a rare departure from the norm, one of the three monopoly electric utilities operating in Oregon is asking state regulators for permission to lower rates for residential customers in 2026.

The reduction, though small at less than 1%, is the result of Idaho Power’s break with coal, according to recent filings with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month. Idaho Power’s request could be on the commission’s agenda in early December, according to Kandi Young, a commission spokesperson.

It’s the result of the company saving $1.3 million by ceasing operations of a coal-burning power plant in Nevada, and through lower regulatory costs since a Boardman coal plant it co-owned with Portland General Electric in eastern Oregon was fully decommissioned in recent years, the filings explain.

Idaho Power plans to end coal-burning operations at the last coal plant it owns, along with PacifiCorp, in Wyoming by 2030, and to convert the facility to burning natural gas. The company has a goal to reach a 100% “clean energy” portfolio for power by 2045, though for now that involves natural gas — almost entirely methane gas, a powerful heat-warming greenhouse gas.

“Idaho Power has a detailed resource planning process that continually seeks the least-cost, least-risk resources to serve our customers,” Jordan Rodriguez, a company spokesperson, said in an email.

The cost savings from ditching coal come as President Donald Trump and his administration fight to keep coal-burning power plants running past dates many utilities had set for decommissioning them.

Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources. And because so many coal plants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old, reviving them will needlessly cost ratepayers more than they need to pay for power. Coal is also among the primary sources of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the International Energy Agency.

In October, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a $625 million investment “to expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry,” which includes $350 million in funding to recommission or modernize existing coal-fired power plants. But in the last four years, more than 100 such plants have closed because they’re not cost-effective to operate anymore, according to researchers at the Ohio-based nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

Electricity prices have risen across the U.S. in recent years — about 13% on average since 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration — in part due to the rise of massive new users like data centers, artificial intelligence processors and bitcoin mining, as well as growing electrification across sectors. But costs have gone up more steeply in several states that rely heavily on coal, including Kentucky and West Virginia. Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.

Rising rates

Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.

Rates for residential customers of Pacific Power and Portland General Electric are up about 50% since 2020.

Officials from both companies blame rising inflation, building infrastructure for more clean energy generation and storage, increasing costs to buy power, higher insurance costs and new customer demand. Power demand from large industrial customers, such as new data centers, is up more than 34% in the last five years, while residential demand is up 5%.

“It’s not very common for a utility to request a decrease in rates, but it does happen occasionally,” said Charlotte Shuff, a spokesperson for the Citizens’ Utility Board, a watchdog group established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of utility consumers.

“What’s more common is a rate decrease after a utility requests an increase,” Shuff said.

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011. It initially asked the state’s Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise rates 27%, but was ultimately allowed a 4% increase. The company recently asked Idaho regulators to allow it to raise rates 17% on Gem State customers in 2026 for infrastructure upgrades, new energy storage facilities and wildfire prevention.

In its latest request to Oregon’s Public Utilities Commission to lower rates for Oregonians, the company said despite its savings, it will need to spend more than $500,000 on wildfire prevention work in the state in the year ahead.

In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill turned a hard-fought gubernatorial race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli into a 13-percentage-point blowout Tuesday with a pledge to freeze soaring electricity rates.

In Virginia, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become the state’s first female governor after trouncing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears with promises to make data-center operators pay for their share of grid upgrades.

And in Georgia, Democrats won two seats on the state’s utility board with arguments that their Republican counterparts had rubber-stamped rate hikes to pay for two costly nuclear reactors and natural gas plants.

The results come at a critical moment for U.S. energy policy. Electricity demand is projected to soar due to data centers and artificial intelligence. Meeting that demand is pushing the limits of America’s network of aging power grids and threatens to send monthly utility bills skyrocketing.

At the same time, the Trump administration has been canceling major wind, solar and power line projects that could help ease the costs of meeting that new demand.

Voters who turned out Tuesday likely weren’t thinking about the intricacies of power management, but they were definitely aware of the increases in their monthly electricity bills, political observers said. That was especially true in New Jersey and Virginia, which belong to a regional electricity market that has struggled to keep up with rapidly increasing demand from data centers.

“These states are huge canaries in the coal mine because these issues are being felt acutely,” said Adrian Deveny, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) who played a key role in drafting former President Joe Biden’s climate law.

In New Jersey, 87 percent of voters surveyed in a CNN exit poll described electricity costs as a “major” or “minor” problem. Sherrill won 54 percent of those voters, though Ciattarelli notably eked out a 51-48 percent advantage among voters who described electricity costs as a major problem.

Some analysts cautioned against overstating the importance of electricity issues. Expressing discontent with President Donald Trump was a major factor in Tuesday’s results, said Clint Andrews, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. Concerns over electricity rates were part of wider voter angst over pocketbook issues like the cost of housing and health insurance.

“It is the affordability election,” he said. “Electricity is a subset of that.”

But for Democrats, who have spent much of the last year in the throes of an identity crisis, Tuesday’s victories supplied the outlines of a message they think can carry them to victory in next year’s midterm elections.

Josh Freed, who leads the climate and energy program at the center-left think tank Third Way, said he had never seen electricity issues rise to the forefront of the national political discussion in the way they did Tuesday. The issue is especially potent because Trump pledged to slash electricity costs in his win over former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

“On the most basic level, the party that controls Washington promised a year ago to cut energy prices in half,” Freed said. “They have failed to deliver, and voters are angry at that. They made that loud and clear basically in every county and every state that had elections.”

Power Centers

The difference a decade makes

It’s been 10 years since the U.S. and European nations pushed countries to sign on to an international agreement to combat climate change, and much has changed since then, Sara Schonhardt writes ahead of the next climate summit in Brazil.

Then-President Barack Obama hailed the Paris Agreement as potentially a “turning point for the world” back in 2015. Since then, Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the accord twice, while Europe’s climate commitments are wavering in the face of pressure from price-weary voters and rising far-right parties.

Still, there’s upside to the Paris Agreement. Scientists say it seems to have staved off the most catastrophic effects of rising temperatures for now.

EU weakens climate goal

EU environment ministers Wednesday agreed to water down their proposed 2040 climate target and set a new plan for 2035, Louise Guillot writes from Brussels.

The plans were approved just ahead of the next United Nations climate summit in Brazil. The nonbinding 2035 plan calls for lowering emissions between 66.25 and 72.5 percent below 1990 by 2035. Then it would switch to a binding agreement to cut the bloc’s emissions 85 percent by 2040.

The plans are similar to those outlined by EU leaders at a climate summit in New York in September.

A lopsided shutdown

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has had uneven impacts across energy and environmental agencies, writes POLITICO’s E&E News.

The Trump administration has found cash to keep some programs funded — with officials prioritizing favored projects — while other work has stopped entirely.

The Interior Department, for example, has barreled ahead with energy development, issuing 600 drilling permits, even as roughly 29,000 employees remain on furlough. EPA has adopted an unusual “phased” approach to furloughs, with some employees remaining on the job to draft rule rollbacks and approve permits. And at the Department of Energy, employees from six offices focused on solar, wind and hydrogen are still awaiting word on whether the agency will follow through on its proposal last month to fire or reassign them.

Saving the Amazon: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to launch an initiative at COP30 that would pay countries to keep rainforests standing. The Tropical Forests Forever Fund already has several developing countries on board, as well as potential investors in Germany, the United Arab Emirates, France, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Turning to the small guys: Manufacturers of small equipment pieces such as fuel cells are getting a boost from the rush to build power for data centers.

Insufficient power: Amazon filed a complaint accusing an Oregon utility of not providing it enough power for its data centers.

• The success of state-led emission reductions and clean energy job growth despite federal uncertainty.

• On-the-ground examples of Wisconsin’s clean energy workforce, manufacturing capacity, and cost-saving community solutions.

• Why Wisconsin’s pragmatic, kitchen-table approach to clean energy is a competitive advantage — especially in a purple state.

Standing on the waterfront in Rio de Janeiro, where hundreds of mayors, governors, and regional leaders have gathered for the COP30 Local Leaders Forum, it’s clear that local action is driving global climate progress. While world leaders prepare to meet in Belém later this month, the real momentum is here — among the subnational leaders delivering measurable results where people live and work.

And Wisconsin, led by Governor Tony Evers, is front and center.

As Co-Chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, Governor Evers joined New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and other U.S. state leaders to release the Alliance’s new Annual Report in Rio. The message was simple and strong: despite federal headwinds and denialism from some quarters, U.S. states are pressing forward — cutting climate pollution, growing the economy, and investing in a cleaner, more resilient future.

“We want the world to know that the United States continues to work at the state level to reduce emissions, create clean energy jobs, and increase resilience — regardless of what our president or anyone else says,” Evers told reporters at the opening session.

Subnational Leadership That Works

The U.S. Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing more than half the U.S. population and GDP — has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 24% since 2005, while growing GDP by 34%. Those numbers tell a powerful story: climate action and economic growth are not opposites. They’re two sides of the same coin.

Alliance states are driving the nation’s clean-energy buildout — responsible for 70% of America’s zero-emission vehicles, 68% of all public EV chargers, and nearly 200 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity added since 2005. Electricity-sector emissions alone have fallen 45% across member states.

That kind of steady progress is why subnational leadership is so vital. Even when Washington wavers, states and localities keep building, innovating, and creating jobs.

Solutions Exchange: From Policy to Practice

At the America Is All In “Solutions Exchange” sessions this week — co-hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies — governors, mayors, and business leaders shared how climate policies translate into real community benefits: lower energy bills, cleaner air, and more resilient infrastructure. It’s a shift from negotiation to delivery, and Wisconsin offers a compelling example.

Our state’s clean-energy workforce now tops 75,000 jobs, spanning manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and services. Visit Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley, and you’ll see companies like Ingeteam building EV chargers and wind-turbine components for projects across the country. These are “Made in Wisconsin” climate solutions powering the global transition.

Wisconsin’s Common-Sense Climate Playbook

In a purple state like ours, climate action succeeds when it’s rooted in kitchen-table common sense — lowering costs, creating local jobs, and protecting our air and water. That pragmatic approach is helping Wisconsin communities weather storms, modernize schools, and give businesses the predictability they need to invest.

Consider the growing number of solar installations on schools and farms, energy-efficiency upgrades in homes and small businesses, and rural areas deploying EV charging corridors that connect tourists and truckers alike. Each project cuts carbon and saves money — the definition of win-win.

Equity is also at the heart of Wisconsin’s progress. Groups like Green Homeowners United are helping low- and moderate-income families weatherize homes, replace old furnaces, and install heat pumps — ensuring the benefits of clean energy reach the people who need them most.

Resilience in the Face of Federal Uncertainty

Evers and his fellow Alliance governors are candid about the challenge ahead. With rollbacks in federal climate policy, states must stay the course — not only to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to safeguard local economies and public health. As Governor Evers noted, “Even when federal leadership falters, our resolve only grows stronger.”

The Alliance’s updated targets are ambitious yet achievable: 26% emissions reduction by 2025, 52% by 2030, and 66% by 2035. Those goals are backed by data, science, and — most importantly — people on the ground who see the benefits of cleaner energy and smarter infrastructure.

Wisconsin’s Role on the Global Stage

Here in Rio, Governor Evers’ leadership reflects something larger: Wisconsin’s growing influence in the global climate conversation. As the U.S. delegation heads to Belém, the message from states like ours is clear — progress doesn’t wait for politics. It’s built city by city, farm by farm, and business by business.

For Wisconsin, that means doubling down on what works:

Supporting manufacturers building the backbone of the clean-energy economy.

Strengthening partnerships among businesses, farms, and communities.

Protecting the public tools — like rebates, tax credits, and utility programs — that make the transition affordable and fair.

By staying pragmatic, collaborative, and grounded in results, Wisconsin can continue to punch above its weight — showing that climate leadership in a purple state is not only possible, it’s a competitive advantage.

That’s the Wisconsin story worth sharing — from Rio to Belém, from our neighborhoods to the world.

AUSTIN, Texas — The state office that advocates on behalf of the public at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) will undergo a review of its duties, the environmental regulator’s commissioners announced today, a move Public Citizen welcomed while stressing that the office must remain independent and unhindered in its advocacy for Texans.

The Office of the Public Interest Council (OPIC) is part of the TCEQ and reviews agency actions, offering feedback and recommendations from a public interest perspective. The review of OPIC’s duties is the first in more than a decade.

“This rulemaking is a welcome opportunity for public input on OPIC’s role, functions and annual performance metrics to increase positive outcomes for communities and improve the office’s effectiveness,” said Kathryn Guerra, director of Public Citizen’s TCEQ Watchdog Campaign. “It is critical that this review ends with OPIC maintaining its independence, and any reforms must not get in the way of the office’s advocacy on behalf of the public. Texans already view TCEQ actions as benefiting corporations first and communities second. The agency will further erode what little public trust it still has if it implements changes at OPIC that make it less effective or independent.”

At today’s TCEQ commissioners’ agenda hearing, Commissioner Catarina Gonzales wondered if OPIC resources would be better employed by focusing on select cases of rulemaking that have an impact on the public interest.

The permanent storage will allow Air Products to make low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia.
They're just asking for a future to be like the past of Lake Maurepas.
Connolly said Air Products has taken steps to minimize the impact by, for example, using existing utility routes and co-locating its various pipelines.
Air Products' carbon injection permit also wasn't one of the six.","A wide-ranging mix of residents, environmental advocates and local elected officials spent nearly four hours airing their concerns this week over plans to build a blue hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish that will use carbon capture technology to store C02 deep under Lake Maurepas.

The public hearing in LaPlace was the latest opportunity for opponents of the project to make their voices heard. The company behind the plan, Air Products, again defended it as an important economic development project that will safely remove climate-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with little disruption to the lake.

The unlikely coalition of opponents at the hearing included a veteran with two-century-old roots in Livingston Parish who cherishes the tranquility of Lake Maurepas and its swamps, crabbers worried about the potential for damaged marine life and environmental justice advocates who see residents again bearing the brunt of the impacts in the name of economic development and tax revenue.

With as much as 138 million tons of CO2 expected to be pumped underground over 25 years, Air Products' storage site under Lake Maurepas would be the largest in the world, the company says. The permanent storage will allow Air Products to make low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia.

Discussed since late 2021, the $4.5 billion project has spawned multiple public displays of concern, unsuccessful attempts by local legislators to block it, and non-binding expressions of opposition from local councils in Livingston and St. John the Baptist parishes.

More than 250 people showed up to a local church in LaPlace on Tuesday night to speak to officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. The agencies are considering permits to allow Air Products to run a 38-mile carbon dioxide pipeline and other lines from its proposed Mississippi River complex to Maurepas. The company would build a network of carbon injection and monitoring wells along with control platforms visible across the lake's surface.

Opposition centered around a number of issues: potential leaks of highly concentrated CO2 from pipelines at risk of corrosion, federal taxpayer support for the project, the impact of dredging of potentially contaminated sediments, questions about whether the storage will prevent as many emissions as predicted, damage to wetlands, and, perhaps at the center of it all, a near-universal appreciation for Lake Maurepas.

Albert Ken Davidson, 71, a 38-year veteran of the U.S. Army and Springfield native, said he grew up on land a half-mile from the lake that his family settled in 1805. It's where he lives with other generations of his family.

""I've been all over the world. Seen some ugly places, seen beautiful places, none more beautiful than that lake,"" he said. ""And it would be a shame if my children, their children, and their children couldn't see it the way our ancestors did years ago.""

Facing concerns like that, a handful of Republican Livingston and Tangipahoa parish legislators and local officials joined with left-leaning environmental advocates to call for the Corps to conduct a full environmental impact statement.

A few called for an even deeper look, known as a programmatic environmental impact statement, to consider not just Air Products' plans but also the cumulative impact of carbon capture proposals popping up in the state and their often dispersed pieces taken together, from production plant to CO2 transport pipeline to underground storage site.

'Failed as a community'

State Sen. Bill Wheat, R-Ponchatoula, told the officials near the end of the lengthy hearing with 54 speakers that the federal agency was the last hope of his constituents who have consistently and broadly opposed Air Products' plans.

""Folks, the people that I represent are not here asking for a lot. They're just asking for a future to be like the past of Lake Maurepas. They want to see that legacy of the livelihoods of their families protected,"" Wheat said. ""We've been failed as a community, to have the state listen to our concerns, up to this point.""

Corps of Engineers officials couldn't comment on the request Wednesday with the permit process just starting.

Under Corps rules, the review starts out as a less detailed, typically one-year-long environmental assessment unless the agency findings bump it up to a longer and more detailed EIS.

If the Corps did proceed with the EIS, it would mean two years of review and potentially another delay for a project that has already been pushed back to a 2028 or 2029 start, at the earliest, due to financial concerns, according to reports.

In late April, Air Products' new CEO said that the company was trying to ""de-risk"" by selling off the ammonia and carbon capture portions of the project now seeking state and federal blessing and to continue finding buyers for its products.

Andrew Connolly, an Air Products vice president, told Corps officials that the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex will make the state a global leader in clean hydrogen, a key industrial feedstock, while the storage operation will capture 95% of its CO2 emissions.

""This will dramatically reduce our work's potential impact on the environment and the surrounding community, while creating markets for our clean Louisiana products and creating and supporting local jobs,"" he said.

The project would create 2,000 construction jobs, up to 200 permanent jobs and $1.3 billion in local tax revenue over its lifespan, Connolly said, citing a recent economic analysis.

'Safely operate'

In addition to sales and property tax revenue going primarily to Ascension Parish and the state, Louisiana and Livingston, St. John and Tangipahoa parishes would also share in up to $160 million in injection payments over the project's life because CO2 is being sent under state water bottoms.

But, the line to deliver that CO2 to Maurepas would run past a public elementary school and neighborhood in Sorrento, near the tip of a hurricane protection levee still under construction, near a planned sediment diversion for wetland restoration and through the Maurepas Wildlife Management Area. The company would also run a 19-mile natural gas line mostly in the last leg of the CO2 line route to power lake operations and also a two-mile hydrogen line onshore.

Construction will require extensive digging, underwater dredging and the destruction of 362 acres of wetlands, Corps papers say. Nearly 90% will be high-value, coastal cypress and tupelo swamps that advocates noted the wildlife management area and broader state efforts have fought for years to protect and restore in the face of degradation due to rising sea levels and salinity.

Connolly said Air Products has taken steps to minimize the impact by, for example, using existing utility routes and co-locating its various pipelines. The company also plans to rehabilitate more than 800 acres of wetlands north of the lake near the Joyce Wildlife Management Area and has planted 6,000 cypress trees and plans to plant more.

He added that the company has an unsurpassed safety record with industrial gases and is working with Ascension emergency officials and others to set up detailed safety procedures for workers and the public.

Connolly said the company was confident ""in our ability to safely operate under these permits,"" though environmental advocates pointed out Air Products is seeking to sell off the carbon capture piece of the project.

Until a state moratorium announced last month, the concept of carbon capture has had strong support from the state's business community, LSU scientists and most statewide elected leadership. It's seen as an attainable and safe bridge technology perfectly suited for Louisiana's sedimentary geology that can create a lower carbon-emitting industrial base.

The technology pumps carbon dioxide that's been pressurized to a near-liquid state underground into natural formations that Air Products, other companies and LSU geologists say have confining layers that would prevent leaks into aquifers.

Amid growing public backlash over the proposals being reviewed across the state, though, Gov. Jeff Landry called for the moratorium last month on new permits and for a prioritization process for proposals that weren't among six state regulators keyed for fast tracking. Air Products' carbon injection permit also wasn't one of the six.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/20/02073af2-af72-5ef6-849d-033d60304b06/645559b8300f6.image.jpg?crop=1602%2C841%2C0%2C225&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-06 06:18:16.607902

IGNATIUS OKOROCHA, Abuja

The Senate on Wednesday at plenary passed for second reading the Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025, sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North), which seeks to establish a comprehensive national framework for the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), promote local manufacturing, ensure environmental sustainability, and position Nigeria as a leader in clean energy transportation in Africa.

The bill, which was extensively debated on the floor of the Senate outlined clear strategies for achieving Nigeria’s transition to electric mobility through local content development, foreign partnership regulations, nationwide charging infrastructure, and a coordinated inter-ministerial framework.

Leading the debate, Senator Kalu said the proposed law is designed to transform Nigeria’s automobile and energy sectors by promoting innovation, local assembly, and environmental protection while creating thousands of jobs across the manufacturing value chain.

“This Bill will help Nigeria move from dependence on fossil fuels toward a cleaner and sustainable energy system.

It will ensure that our local industries benefit directly from the emerging global electric vehicle market, create jobs, and reduce emissions in our cities,” Kalu stated.

The Lawmaker added that the Bill provides incentives such as tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, subsidies, and road tax exemptions for electric vehicle users and investors, while also mandating the installation of charging points in all fuel stations across the country.

One of the key highlights of the Bill is its emphasis on local content compliance.

It mandates that all foreign automakers seeking to operate in Nigeria must enter into partnerships with licensed Nigerian assemblers and establish assembly plants within three years of operation.

Furthermore, such companies must attain at least 30 percent local sourcing of components by 2030.

Non-compliance attracts strict penalties, including the suspension of operations and a fine of ₦250 million per violation.

Additionally, any unlicensed dealer involved in the importation or sale of electric vehicles without government authorization would face a ₦500 million fine per shipment, alongside confiscation of goods.

The Bill also prohibits unauthorised research and development partnerships, ensuring that government grants or incentives for electric vehicle innovation are channeled through licensed Nigerian institutions.

“We are creating a system that protects Nigerian industries and ensures that technology transfer and innovation happen locally,” Senator Kalu explained.

The Bill establishes a comprehensive regulatory and institutional structure coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment, supported by key agencies including:

Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON): To develop safety and performance standards for electric vehicles, batteries, and charging equipment;

Federal Ministry of Transportation: To oversee licensing, public transportation integration, and EV infrastructure guidelines;

Federal Ministry of Power: To ensure renewable energy integration into charging systems and develop energy tariffs for EVs;

Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS): To administer tax incentives and publish annual reports on fiscal impacts; and

Federal Ministry of Environment: To oversee battery recycling, waste management, and compliance with Nigeria’s environmental obligations under the Paris Agreement.

Economic Growth and Industrial Diversification

Beyond the environmental benefits, the Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill seeks to unlock new economic opportunities by expanding local production capacity and deepening Nigeria’s participation in the global EV value chain.

Clause 3 of the Bill mandates that any Nigerian company seeking to assemble electric vehicles must demonstrate a minimum annual production capacity of 5,000 units, compliance with international safety standards, and proof of financial and technical capacity to sustain operations.

The Bill also provides that private investors setting up charging stations will be eligible for government grants and tax credits, while all fuel stations will be required to install charging points to ensure seamless adoption nationwide.

“Our goal is to make Nigeria the hub of electric vehicle manufacturing in Africa, create jobs for our youth, and support our transition toward renewable energy,” Kalu reiterated.

Contributing to the debate :

lawmakers across party lines commended Kalu who equally chairs the Senate Committee on South East Development Commission for the foresight in sponsoring a bill that aligns Nigeria with global technological and environmental trends.

Senator Adamu Aliero (Kebbi Central) stressed the importance of reducing Nigeria’s carbon footprint, especially in heavily industrialized and traffic-congested cities.

“The world is moving forward, and cities like Lagos and Kano are already suffering from high carbon emissions. Electric vehicles will drastically cut down pollution, improve public health, and create a new industrial ecosystem for Nigeria.

“Instead of exporting lithium, we should process and utilize it here at home to create jobs and diversify our economy,” Aliero said.

Senator Osita Ngwu (Enugu West) emphasized that the transition to electric vehicles would also help Nigeria address the long-term dangers of climate change.

“Climate change is already affecting our communities and agricultural productivity. Embracing clean mobility is part of our national responsibility to future generations,” he stated.

In the same vein, Senator Titus Zam argued that Nigeria could no longer afford to lag behind as many nations across the world had adopted electric vehicle policies.

“From Europe to Asia and even several African countries, the electric vehicle revolution has already taken shape. Nigeria must not be left behind if we hope to remain competitive and relevant,” Zam said.

After extensive debate, the Bill was put to a voice vote and passed for second reading.

In his remarks, the President of the Senate President Godswill Akpabio commended Senator Kalu for his vision and described the Bill as a forward-looking legislative initiative that aligns with President Bola Tinubu’s economic diversification agenda and global energy transition trends.

“This Bill represents an important step toward sustainable industrial growth and environmental responsibility. Nigeria must prepare for the future of transportation and energy,” Akpabio said.

The Bill was subsequently referred to the Senate Committee on Industry for further legislative scrutiny and is expected to report back to the chamber within four weeks.

There are jobs across solar, wind, energy efficiency, clean vehicles, batteries and other sectors. The bulk of the workforce are employed in the construction and professional services industries. In 2024, clean energy employed about seven times more workers than the fossil fuel industry (80,600) in the state.

The data in this report predates the July 2025 passage of the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which is expected to slow clean energy job growth nationwide. Still, the job numbers point to a resilient and essential clean energy workforce.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-05 22:25:08+00:00,ABC News,Judge allows Trump administration to reconsider approval for a Massachusetts offshore wind farm,"JENNIFER MCDERMOTT Associated Press, ABC News",,,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-allows-trump-administration-reconsider-approval-massachusetts-offshore-127235801,"A federal court judge is allowing the Trump administration to reconsider a major federal permit that was granted to a Massachusetts offshore wind farm days before the president's inauguration.
Massachusetts has led in offshore wind to meet its goals for clean energy and demand for electricity.
His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.
In another lawsuit, a federal judge ruled in September that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration could resume, dealing Trump a setback.
Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of supplying power to more than 350,000 homes, about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.","A federal court judge is allowing the Trump administration to reconsider a major federal permit that was granted to a Massachusetts offshore wind farm days before the president's inauguration.

Developer SouthCoast Wind said Wednesday it's assessing the decision and next steps, including the pursuit of legal remedies. SouthCoast Wind is a project planned for federal waters about 23 miles (37 kilometers) south of Nantucket, with as many as 141 turbines to power about 840,000 homes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Construction has not yet begun.

The Trump administration is using executive orders, agency actions and the courts to try to stop the development of offshore wind, an industry and technology that President Donald Trump has attacked as “ugly” and unreliable compared to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

Massachusetts has led in offshore wind to meet its goals for clean energy and demand for electricity. The state's governor said the region needs this power.

“There is absolutely no need for the Trump administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy to the states,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.

Nantucket sued the Interior Department in March. The town asked a U.S. District Court judge in Washington to set aside the federal government's approvals to construct the wind farm, arguing that it will damage the town's character, community and tourism economy.

The federal defendants filed a motion in September seeking to revoke approval of the project’s ""construction and operations plan."" It was the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water. The Interior Department said the approval may not have fully complied with the law and may have failed to account for all the project's impacts.

Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered Tuesday that the permit be remanded to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, for reconsideration. She wrote that it was “in the interest of judicial economy,” or saving time and resources, since Nantucket supports reconsideration, and the developer wouldn't “suffer significant and immediate hardship.”

Nantucket said the court’s ruling affirms its longstanding position that the federal government must take a hard look at potential flaws in the environmental and cultural analysis underpinning offshore wind permitting decisions.

SouthCoast Wind said it has invested over $600 million in development and permitting, including lease fee payments to the federal government, since acquiring the lease during the first Trump administration. CEO Michael Brown said they continue to believe in the value this project brings to the region, by providing domestic energy and supporting well-paying union jobs.

BOEM approved SouthCoast’s operations plan on Jan. 17, three days before Trump’s second term began.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels for electricity. His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects. The moves are a complete reversal from the Biden administration.

In another lawsuit, a federal judge ruled in September that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration could resume, dealing Trump a setback. Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of supplying power to more than 350,000 homes, about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.

""By expanding our agreement to 400MW with their Powered Land Capabilities, we've enabled a comprehensive solution for power, grid connectivity, and site infrastructure, while maintaining our commitment to responsible energy use.
The DFW10 data center will be located adjacent to the Calpine-owned Thad Hill Energy Center.
Reports of the data center first emerged last November, following a filing to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, and the two companies signed a 190MW deal related to the site in July.
The data center will be constructed through a phased approach, with the facility’s first phase covering 190,000 sq ft (17,651 sqm), with a capacity of 144MW.","The new contract adds 210MW of power to the 190MW originally announced in July, completing a deal that will secure power, grid connection, and land to support the CyrusOne facility, which is currently under construction and expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2026.

""Our partnership with Calpine exemplifies the innovation required to meet the growth in data center demand,"" said Eric Schwartz, CEO of CyrusOne. ""By expanding our agreement to 400MW with their Powered Land Capabilities, we've enabled a comprehensive solution for power, grid connectivity, and site infrastructure, while maintaining our commitment to responsible energy use. The Thad Hill facility will set a benchmark for future hyperscale developments across Texas and beyond.""

The DFW10 data center will be located adjacent to the Calpine-owned Thad Hill Energy Center. Thad Hill is a natural gas power plant with a capacity of 250MW. It was commissioned back in 2010 and serves the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. Calpine is owned by a consortium of companies, led by Energy Capital Partners (ECP).

Reports of the data center first emerged last November, following a filing to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, and the two companies signed a 190MW deal related to the site in July.

""One of the agreement attributes that we are most proud of is the ability for Calpine and CyrusOne to coordinate our operations to ensure grid reliability in times of supply scarcity,"" said Andrew Novotny, Calpine's president and CEO. ""By continuing to actively manage our generation output, these partnerships actually enhance grid reliability by curtailing in times of need. These agreements also deliver significant financial benefits for the community and the state of Texas, all while helping the US lead in the critical AI race simultaneously.""

The data center will be constructed through a phased approach, with the facility’s first phase covering 190,000 sq ft (17,651 sqm), with a capacity of 144MW. Sources familiar with the deal told DCD that the second phase would expand the campus to more than 700,000 sq ft (65,032 sqm) and deliver an IT capacity of 288MW.

KKR-owned CyrusOne has more than 50 data centers across the US and European markets.

According to the American Lung Association, one in three people in the U.S. will breathe in unhealthy air that can impact their health. By providing tools to monitor outdoor air quality, CNO EPS is empowering the community to take proactive steps to safeguard their health.

While air pollution affects everyone, certain groups are more vulnerable, including:

People with heart or lung disease

People active outdoors

Older adults

Children

Outdoor workers

CNO’s programs utilize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI) to indicate air quality. AQI utilizes a color-coded system that makes it easy to understand air quality conditions at a glance.

Green = good air quality

Yellow = moderate

Orange = unhealthy for sensitive groups

Red = unhealthy

Purple = very unhealthy

Maroon = hazardous

Air quality monitoring at your fingertips

In partnership with JustAir, CNO EPS now offers a real-time air quality dashboard tailored for the Choctaw Nation reservation. Residents can:

View daily air quality conditions in their area

Receive location-specific alerts straight to their phones

Air Quality Flag Program helps keep educators and parents informed

In addition to the air quality dashboard, CNO EPS has installed air quality indication flags at all Choctaw Nation Head Start locations across the reservation.

The color-coded flag system is designed to help educators, parents, and community members easily understand daily air pollution levels. Each morning, staff will raise a flag—green, yellow, orange, red, or purple—indicating the day’s air quality and any necessary precautions.

Why monitoring air quality is important

Higher third-quarter EV deliveries helped boost revenue 78% from a year earlier to about $1.56 billion, topping Wall Street estimates.
The company has also seen higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs while the elimination of policies supporting EV adoption have hurt revenue.","Rivian Automotive Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected loss in a sign of progress as the electric-vehicle maker cuts costs and staff ahead of plans to begin deliveries of a new midsize SUV next year.

The third-quarter adjusted loss was 65 cents a share, the company said in a letter to shareholders. That’s better than the 71-cent average deficit expected by analysts. Rivian slashed automotive cost of revenue by nearly $19,000 on a per-vehicle basis year over year, according to the letter.

Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe is pushing to control expenses and corral years of losses as the company prepares to launch the new midsize R2 SUV next year. The model is critical for Rivian’s goal to boost sales volumes and achieve profitability in the future.

Rivian is on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026 and will launch with features and a price to “make the most people the most happy,” Scaringe told analysts on an earnings call.

The model’s launch next year “remains a top priority which we expect will materially increase” the size of the market Rivian can address thanks to the vehicle’s lower price, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a note.

Rivian’s shares rose more than 14% in midmorning trading in New York. The stock had declined 6% this year through Tuesday’s close, trailing the S&P 500 Index’s 15% advance.

Higher third-quarter EV deliveries helped boost revenue 78% from a year earlier to about $1.56 billion, topping Wall Street estimates. The company sold more than 13,000 EVs in the period, helped by consumers rushing to secure the $7,500 U.S. tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30.

More recently, the auto industry has contended with the risk that a shortage of chips from Nexperia BV could halt production lines.

“This has not impacted us yet” though it’s a “serious issue” for the industry, Scaringe said in a CNBC interview.

Rivan had already trimmed its vehicle-sales outlook twice this year and warned of mounting losses. The company has also seen higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs while the elimination of policies supporting EV adoption have hurt revenue.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” the company said in the letter.

The company said it now expects the tariff impact per vehicle to be hundreds of dollars, down from the couple thousand dollar hit it saw per car in the third quarter. That’s largely due to the expansion of a policy that will let automakers offset tariffs on certain imported parts, Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough said on the earnings call.

The automaker said it doesn’t anticipate any meaningful revenue from the sale of regulatory credits next year.

Consumers pulled back on EV purchases in October, which dropped 43% compared to the same month last year, according to automotive consultancy Urban Science.

Rivian also said it set up a new company this month called Mind Robotics, focused on the advancement of AI-enabled robotics in industrial applications. The new venture secured about $110 million in external seed capital.

PROMISE MADE: “I will defend religious liberty.” (1/19/25) ✅ PROMISE KEPT: The Trump Administration directed all federal agencies to protect religious expression in the workplace.","One year ago today, the American people delivered a resounding mandate to President Donald J. Trump when they overwhelmingly re-elected him to an historic second term. In just ten months since his inauguration as the 47th President of the United States, he has moved with unprecedented speed and resolve to secure the border, drive down costs, restore public safety, and unleash American energy and prosperity — and momentum is building for even greater achievements ahead.

Here are just some of President Trump’s PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT:

Stopping the migrant invasion

PROMISE MADE: “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country.” (10/12/24)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: Under President Trump, the number of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border are at historic lows after his rapid action to close the border on Day One, with illegal crossings plummeting to levels not seen in decades and virtually no illegal aliens being released into the country’s interior.

PROMISE MADE: “I will immediately end the Biden border nightmare that traffickers are using to exploit vulnerable women and children.” (7/21/23)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: The number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing into the country has reached a record low. At its peak under Biden, 4.6% of illegal border crossings were unaccompanied minors — many of whom were victims of trafficking. In the first two weeks of March under President Trump, that percentage had already fallen to just 0.4% of illegal crossings.

PROMISE MADE: “325,000 children are missing or dead. They came through the border… 325,000 children went through her stupid open border, and now they’re either missing, dead, or slaves. If you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote.” (11/1/24)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: After the Biden Administration lost track of 325,000 migrant children, the Trump Administration has located more than 13,000 of them — fulfilling President Trump’s promise to do everything possible to save child victims of human trafficking.

PROMISE MADE: “Under my leadership, we will seal it up and expand that wall until we have total control.” (3/4/23)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: President Trump resumed construction of the border wall immediately, with dozens of miles of new construction underway — including new border barrier projects underway in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley.

PROMISE MADE: “I will end catch-and-release.” (10/12/24)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: Since taking office, the Trump Administration has arrested 150,000+ illegal immigrants, deported 139,000+ illegal immigrants, and released just nine illegal immigrants into the U.S. — a staggering 99.99% decrease over the same period last year under Biden.

PROMISE MADE: “We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.” (1/20/25)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: Soon after taking office, President Trump reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy — ensuring would-be illegal border crossers are not able to wait with little consequence in the U.S. for the resolution of their cases.

PROMISE MADE: “Kamala’s app for illegals will be shut down immediately — within 24 hours.” (10/12/24)

✅ PROMISE KEPT: President Trump ended the app’s use almost immediately after taking office — eventually repurposing it to allow migrants to self-deport.

The legislation seeks to create a national framework for Nigeria’s shift to electric vehicles (EVs), promote local manufacturing and strengthen the country’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

Sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North), the bill received broad support as lawmakers outlined strategies for transitioning to electric mobility through local content development, foreign partnerships and nationwide charging infrastructure.

Leading the debate, Kalu said the law aims to transform Nigeria’s automotive and energy sectors, foster innovation and create jobs across the manufacturing value chain.

A key provision requires foreign automakers to partner with licensed Nigerian assemblers and establish local assembly plants within three years, with at least 30 percent local content sourcing by 2030. Violations could attract fines of up to 250 million naira per breach, while unlicensed EV importers risk 500 million naira fines and goods confiscation.

Economically, the bill also seeks to make Nigeria a hub for EV manufacturing in Africa by mandating that assemblers produce a minimum of 5,000 units annually and meet international safety and technical standards. Investors establishing charging stations will also qualify for government grants and tax credits.

When do applications start for the Indiana Energy Assistance Program?
Emergency Energy Assistance Programs in Indiana So what happens if you don't qualify for Indiana's Energy Assistance Program?","As temperatures fall, electricity bills across Indiana will start to rise. Some Hoosiers might struggle this year to pay their utilities because of soaring U.S. food prices, increasing local energy costs or steadily climbing inflation — compounded by the fast approaching holidays.

Millions of lower-income Americans who depend on food stamps from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could face additional hardship to cover the cost of their electricity during the ongoing government shutdown.

Roughly 586,000 Hoosiers were enrolled in the food stamp program as of May, according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data, but a prominent message appearing on the USDA's official website Oct. 27 announced no benefits would be issued beginning Nov. 1.

Two federal judges have since ordered the Trump Administration to fund SNAP benefits, in which Trump agreed Nov. 3 to partially back the program. It remains unclear though how soon food stamps could return. Experts say it might take days, if not weeks for the money to be paid.

In the meantime, thousands of Hoosiers might face the difficult choice of having either groceries or heat during the coldest months of the year.

Eligible Indiana residents can lower the cost of electricity if they qualify for the state's Energy Assistance Program. Among other benefits, it can help prevent a utility company from disconnecting your power.

Here's who qualifies for Indiana's EAP benefits and how to get them.

What is the Indiana Energy Assistance Program?

The Energy Assistance Program will help cover a portion of your electricity bill. It's a federally-funded program through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Recipients also can use the program to offset energy related home-repairs.

Who is eligible for the Energy Assistance Program in Indiana?

EAP benefits are available for those who earn 60% of Indiana's state median income, according to LIHEAP's eligibility requirements.

According to IndyEAP, the last three months of your gross household income, including any unearned income from household members age 18 and above, must not exceed the following:

1-Person Household: $8,389

2-Person Household: $10,970

3-Person Household: $13,551

4-Person Household: $16,133

5-Person Household: $18,714

6-Person Household: $21,295

7-Person Household: $21,779

8-Person Household: $22,263

What if I don't qualify for the Indiana Energy Assistance Program?

If you fall outside these income margins, there are other programs in Indiana that can potentially help lower the cost of your electricity, which are listed below.

How much does Indiana's Energy Assistance Program cover?

Nearly 122,000 Hoosiers signed up for EAP benefits during the 2024 fiscal year, according to state data from LIHEAP, in which the program covered $100-$675 in heating bills for Indiana residents in 2025.

The specific amount of money paid is determined by each household size, income, at-risk factors, and fuel source, according to the organization.

Are applications being accepted during the government shutdown?

Applications for EAP benefits are being accepted by the Marion County Energy Assistance Program, IndyEAP, despite the ongoing government shutdown.

The federal funds for the program are administered by the Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority, IHCDA, in which a spokesperson gave this message to IndyStar:

""The IHCDA office remains open and the agency will continue to accept federal program draws and process claims (during the shutdown). At this time, no significant disruption of services is anticipated,” a spokesperson said.

When do applications start for the Indiana Energy Assistance Program?

Applications for EAP benefits in Marion County began Oct. 1, 2025. The last day to submit an application is April 20, 2026. Those who signed up for the program last year will need to sign up for it again.

How long does the application process take?

The application process can take up to 55 days and approval is not guaranteed, so it's better to get started as soon as possible rather than wait.

How do people receive Energy Assistance Program benefits?

If you're a homeowner, EAP benefits are paid directly to your utility provider. For those who rent, and whose utilities are included in the cost of rent, the benefit is paid directly to you, but it might take up to 120 days for the payment to process.

Can the Energy Assistance Program help prevent my power from being cut off?

According to the organization, EAP recipients are protected from having their electricity disconnected from Dec. 1, 2025, to March 15, 2026.

What do you need to apply for the Energy Assistance Program in Indiana?

To apply for EAP benefits, fill out an application along with providing your proof of income for the past 90 days and a copy of your utility bills. According to IndyEAP, applicants do not need a photo ID, social security card, copy of their lease, nor their birth certificate.

The Save Our Seas (S.O.S.)","Though the U.S. federal government remains in a shutdown after funding lapsed in October, the Senate has continued to process legislation.

At the end of October, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and U.S. Senator Sheldom Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) introduced a bill to renew authorization and funding for the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act for another five years.

“This will allow the EPA to continue combatting marine debris by implementing four programs to improve recycling, keep trash out of rivers and streams, and keep plastics out of our drinking water and wastewater,” U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan said during a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works meeting 29 October.

Sullivan and Whitehouse introduced the original legislation back in 2020, and it was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump during the final days of his first term.

“It was the most comprehensive ocean cleanup act in the history of our country,” Sullivan recalled during the meeting.

The law directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) program, which has provided more than USD 100 million (EUR 87 million) in grants to local projects already.

“In the first round, every eligible state and territory requested funding, demonstrating bipartisan need for tackling dangerous plastic waste,” Whitehouse said.

According to the Recycling Partnership, the EPA received 452 applications for funding under the SWIFR program, with requested funding totaling USD 950 million (EUR 828 million).

“The SWIFR grants are critical to bettering America’s recycling system so that we can prevent materials from ending up in landfills or the environment and keep them in the economy where they belong,” The Recycling Partnership Chief Recycling Officer Cody said in a statement of support for the reauthorization bill. “Delivering on the EPA’s promise to better the American economy and environment, the recycling programs funded through SWIFR reduce waste, strengthen domestic supply chains, and allow communities to develop infrastructure that meets their needs.”

Despite the high demand for grant funding, the program was only authorized for five years and is set to expire. Sullivan’s and Sheldon’s legislation would extend that authorization through 2030.

The Committee on Environment and Public Works approved the bill at the 29 October meeting, clearing it for a vote by the full Senate.

However, the legislative push for reauthorization of the EPA program comes amidst the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to gut the agency. Under Trump’s direction, thousands of EPA employees have been laid off or bought out, and the White House has moved to lay off more staff via reduction in force (RIF) notices during the ongoing government shutdown. The Trump administration has proposed cutting the agency’s funding by more than 50 percent in fiscal year 2026.

“Recycling is a key focus of this program, so it is frustrating that two dozen EPA employees in the Recycling Office were just marked for layoff,” Sheldon said at the Congressional meeting. “This behavior in a program with broad bipartisan support enforcing a law signed by President Trump is why EPA’s credibility is so shot.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers introduced similar legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the original Save Our Seas 2.0 Act. The Save Our Seas (S.O.S.) 2.0 Amendments Act would reauthorize the program, encourage outreach to Tribes, establish a new office for the Marine Debris Foundation, and allow the Marine Debris Program to utilize nontraditional contracts.

The House has not taken action on the bill, but it was passed by the Senate in May.",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/fb4fb4ef8cc1f22c8f6035d14dc8ab1a.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:01:29.161252

Germany has emerged as a regional leader in the adoption and implementation of advanced technologies that drastically improve efficiency. The nation has become an exemplar of how to integrate renewable energy resources like solar power, and now, a large German energy company has announced a new battery optimization platform for Iberian solar networks.

German energy experts have called on the government to increase investments in solar power

While the rest of the world stagnates in its embrace of the renewable energy sector, Germany has emerged as a global leader. The country has become universally renowned for its engineering excellence and unparalleled attention to detail.

However, the German nation is falling short of expectations in the energy sector to diversify its energy portfolio, leading to calls by industry experts to increase investments in solar and wind power. However, a German energy trader has announced its plans to expand its reach into Spain and Portugal.

Entrix GmbH has launched its expansion into several European energy markets

Entrix is a German company with vast experience in the energy sector, and now the company has announced a new battery optimization platform for its Iberian solar power network, as well as in Portugal. The company plans to take advantage of a new AI-driven battery optimization process that will enable it to successfully enter the Iberian and Portuguese energy markets.

Entrix is expanding its already impressive European solar portfolio

The company already has several solar projects on the go in Warsaw and Milan, and the Iberian office will lean on the vast expertise of its CEO, who formerly managed Uber in Spain, to ensure a successful entry into Spain’s solar market.

The company will lean on its vast battery storage assets in Germany, Poland, and Italy, which combined account for around 2.5 GW and 7.2 GWh. The world has seen the renewable energy sector gaining momentum in recent years, as the sector aims to overtake the conventional energy sector to reshape the global energy sector for the better of everyone.

Entrix’s plans for Spain can count on the already impressive energy storage pipeline in the region, which exceeds 36 GW, including over 20 GW of projects with grid connection.

“Spain and Portugal are key markets in Entrix’s European expansion. We believe our technology can play a vital role in advancing the energy transition in the region – by helping to build a strong storage market that enhances grid stability, flexibility, and the profitability of storage investments.” – Entrix CEO Steffen Schuelzchen

Europe has become the spiritual home of the renewable energy sector, as evidenced by the recent news that Germany, where Entrix is based, has inaugurated a massive solar cluster in Brandenburg. Entrix utilizes the latest in artificial intelligence to optimize its battery storage facilities and capacity, making it an exemplar of how to benefit from the wave of AI power sweeping across the world.

Overall, U.S. LNG exports in October were up 1 million tons, or 11%, from a revised 9.1 million tons in September.

Shipping data provided by Bloomberg shows 84 LNG tankers departed Louisiana export terminals in the four weeks between Oct. 2 and Oct. 29, representing 67% of total U.S. loadings in the period. In the same four weeks, 38 LNG tankers departed Texas export facilities, while six shipments left terminals in Virginia and Georgia, the data shows.

While U.S. LNG shipments continued to increase in October, more of the Haynesville shale gas that feeds the export terminals changed hands during the month.

JERA, one of the world’s largest LNG buyers, agreed in October to pay $1.5 billion to GEP Haynesville and Williams for assets around the South Mansfield gas field in Louisiana, as reported by The Center Square. In March, Rockcliff Energy III, a subsidiary of Tokyo Gas, purchased a 70% interest in Chevron’s East Texas Haynesville shale assets.

“A land rush into the Haynesville by Asia companies with LNG commitments continues with JERA acquiring the South Mansfield joint venture from GEP Haynesville and Williams for $1.5 billion,” said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence, in a research note.

“Asia-based buyers have become the dominant force for acquisitions in the play, willing to outbid domestic producers to secure natural gas feedstock linked to the Gulf Coast’s growing LNG hub. For these buyer groups, a premium for assets is justified to hedge against a longer-term increase in Henry Hub as Haynesville inventory is depleted and to ensure a cost-effective source of supply,” Dittmar wrote.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2021/12/Venture-Global.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:01:46.318031

Exelon seeks power supply role

Exelon serves more than 10.7 million customers through six regulated transmission and distribution utilities: Atlantic City Electric, Baltimore Gas and Electric, Commonwealth Edison, Delmarva Power & Light, PECO Energy and Potomac Electric Power Co.

The company is continuing to press for a role in providing power in deregulated states like Maryland and Pennsylvania, where utilities are barred from owning power plants.

“All states need to leverage all available options to bring control, certainty and customer benefits to securing power,” Calvin Butler, Exelon president and CEO, said Tuesday during an earnings conference call with analysts.

Utilities can help states ensure they have adequate power supplies through investments in energy efficiency, distributed and community solar and storage, or by owning more traditional generation plants, Butler said.

A pending solicitation for dispatchable generation in Maryland appears to have fallen short of its goal, Butler said. Bids were due at the Maryland Public Service Commission on Oct. 31.

Constellation Energy offered 714 MW of gas-fired, combustion turbines and four 200-MW, four-hour battery storage projects. The storage projects have a 58% effective load carrying capability — a measure of reliability during peak demand periods — while the solicitation called for resources with a minimum 65% ELCC.

Alpha Generation offered a 35-MW uprate at its gas-fired Keys Energy Center, and Total Civil Construction and Engineering made a confidential offer, according to filings at the PSC.

Maryland Department of Natural Resources staff is set to make a recommendation in December on which projects to advance for a fast-track certificate of public convenience and necessity review at the PSC.

“This is all about solving the problem and bringing energy costs under control for our customers,” Butler said. “We are more than willing to step up.”

Data center pipeline grows

Besides the 18 GW of data center load that is in official phases of engineering with paid deposits, Exelon utilities have 6 GW of potential data center customers that are close to signing transmission service agreements that lay out the terms and conditions for being connected to the grid, according to the Chicago-based company.

The TSAs help weed out speculative data center projects while insulating the rest of the utility customer base from costs related to serving the data centers, according to Jeanne Jones, Exelon executive vice president and CFO.

The first TSA developed by an Exelon utility is between PECO Energy and Amazon Data Services, Jones said. The agreement outlines how Amazon will pay for any grid upgrades that are needed to supply power to its planned data center in Falls Township, Pennsylvania.

Vistra is set to supply power to the data center from the 1,320-MW, gas-fired Fairless power plant in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, which it bought from Lotus Infrastructure Partners on Oct. 22.

The TSA is under review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The partnership was supposed to lead to an affordable EV, too, but fell apart before that could seriously progress.
Mibe noted that reducing battery cost is an obvious linchpin in any strategy to create more affordable electric vehicles.
“Given this slowing down in the electrification market, it’s hard to decide when we would make them available to the market,” Mibe said.
“Honda has chosen to split their resources across all of these different pathways—electric vehicles, combustion vehicles, and hybrid vehicles,” he said.","A few years back, as part of an effort to demonstrate that it was taking EVs more seriously than it had previously demonstrated, Honda’s global CEO Toshihiro Mibe gathered members of the automotive press in Tokyo for a status seminar. He noted its partnership with General Motors as a hallmark, with joint plans to build vehicles not only on GM’s current Ultium platform, but to collaborate on future affordable EV underpinnings for later in the 2020s.

He discussed Honda’s plans to pilot solid-state batteries, an innovative and potentially transformative area in which he felt Honda could dominate. And he hinted at potential strategies for expanding hybrid production, particularly into its larger American market SUVs and trucks.

In the intervening years, none of that has really happened. So when Honda invited me to another such confab at this year’s Japan Mobility Show, I vehemently accepted. I arrived with a lot of questions. I managed to parse out a few answers.

What went wrong GM, and what's next for EV partnerships?

Less than a year-and-a-half after it formally began in April of 2022, Honda and GM summarily cancelled their $5 billion EV collab, having birthed only one badge-engineered mid-five-figure vehicle each for Acura and Honda, the Blazer EV-based ZDX and Prologue. (The ZDX has already been canceled.)

Mibe was a bit cryptic as to why this fell apart. “We found out that, even if we collaborated together, it was very difficult to come up with one clear winning and profitable strategy in EVs,” he said.

2025 Honda Prologue Elite

He did, however, hint a bit at what went wrong. As a company known for a deep commitment to R&D and to out-of-the-box thinking, Honda might have bristled a bit at partnering with (or supplicating itself to) GM. “In terms of technology, Honda would like to have the leading position,” Mibe said. “So ideally, if Honda has developed the technology, it can be shared with other OEMs. That would be best.” He added that the company remained open to “exploring different ways to work with other partners,” but didn’t name any names.

Telemetry vice president of market research Sam Abuelsamid concurs that the Honda/GM partnership may have been a poor match, in part because neither company could find a play for its alleged strengths in new technologies. Honda’s expertise in fuel cells didn’t yield any tangible results, and GM’s advanced work in autonomous driving imploded as its Cruise subsidiary flamed out.

The Acura ZDX is one of two products to come from Honda's brief tie-up with General Motors. The partnership was supposed to lead to an affordable EV, too, but fell apart before that could seriously progress.

“I think that Honda also looked at the challenges that GM was having on the software side on the Ultium platform and the intense weight of that platform, and probably decided, we can do something better on our own or with a different partner,” Abuelsamid added.

One new company that Honda has already partnered with is LG Energy Solutions, with whom it has a joint venture in Ohio. “LG is the first manufacturer building LFP [lithium-iron-phosphate] cells at scale in North America,” Abuelsamid said, mentioning the more stable, longer-lasting, and less expensive nature of this battery chemistry as potential benefits. “So, it’s absolutely possible that Honda, and other joint venture partners like Stellantis and GM, will use some LFP capacity to provide a lower cost option for some of their EVs.”

Will Honda make an affordable EV for the U.S. market?

Mibe noted that reducing battery cost is an obvious linchpin in any strategy to create more affordable electric vehicles. And while he noted that Honda is currently considering a range of potential technological and chemical solutions for that, he was no longer touting a strong position in any particular solution. This includes the brand’s formerly heavy reliance on solid-state batteries as the key to the future.

“We are working on increasing the capacity of all EV batteries, and solid-state batteries are part of that,” Mibe said. “They are in the research stage, and it is going quite well. We already have established a pilot production line. But even if the technology is good, the cost remains high. In order to get that into the market, we need to have the proper volume in order to justify the investment.” Continuing to kick the can down the road, he said that Honda hoped to launch a solid-state-powered product “by around 2030 or so.”

Even if this occurs, this may not be a core differentiator for the brand. “Everybody’s working on solid state,” Abuelsamid said. “Honda is still cracking away at that. But so is Nissan and Toyota and everybody in that space.” Mercedes and Stellantis, too, have made moves toward SSBs.

The Honda 0 Series is the company's first long-range, mass-market EV line. But while it's a big deal for Honda, it's not going to be an affordable people's car. Think more $50,000-$60,000.

As far as developing an affordable EV in the short term, Honda seems to be not only monitoring the current regulatory retrogradism in Washington, but abiding it. “What’s making it a little bit difficult is that the EV subsidies are now gone,” Mibe said. “With the Trump administration in place, we have the sense that maybe EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years into the future. So, the timing for doing anything right now would be difficult.”

In fact, Mibe stated outright that the brand is waiting until at least the midterm elections in late 2026 to make any further decisions about progressing with such programs. “We need to look at how the administration would act in view of the latest environmental activity,” he said, as if the vehemently anti-clean energy Trump administration could be called on to change in any significant way by a Democratic-led Congress. “That would have an impact on our EV strategy, so we need to monitor the situation carefully to make any decisions.”

Whether by strategy or coincidence, other automakers are not playing the same wait-and-see game. Instead of sitting on their thumbs, they are aggressively pursuing affordability. The new Nissan Leaf, the Chevy Equinox EV and the revival of the Chevy Bolt, Hyundai’s announced $9000 price cuts on the Ioniq 5, Kia’s planned introduction of the EV3 and Ford and Slate’s forthcoming electric trucks are all examples of appealing EVs in the sub-$35,000 or even sub-$30,000 range.

A $30,000 micro-truck sounds like the sort of cheerful, affordable product Honda would make. But for now, it's waiting out a tide of EV uncertainty.

“From what we’ve seen of the electric products that are coming from Honda, they don’t look like they’re focused on the really affordable end of the market,” Abuelsamid said. “They’re more in the middle, like $50,000 or $60,000. And I think that’s going to be the toughest segment going forward because customers for those vehicles were probably more sensitive to the presence of the tax credits.”

While I was in Japan, Honda unveiled a smaller, more affordable electric SUV to add to its battery-only 0 Series lineup, the Alpha. This vehicle will be aimed mainly at the Indian market, now the world’s third largest after China and the U.S.

The company was predictably tight-lipped on how it was going to remove cost from the vehicle, though Abuelsamid suspected that it might include reducing battery price through the use of LFP or NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) cells, and declining to include some of the more advanced electronics—like the zonal architecture—that will underpin other 0-Series models, substituting them with “more legacy components.”

But when asked if Honda had any plans to bring this reduced-price vehicle to the States, Mibe was quite confident in his response. “We think the 0 Series Alpha is a bit too small for the US market because of the size of the car,” he said. “We are not planning to sell the 0 Alpha to the US.” And while he said that the company would “like to consider this $30,000 EV in the future,” he did not provide any specifics as to how it would accomplish this goal, or with what product.

The Honda 0 α is a smaller electric SUV, but it's not coming to America.

Instead, the brand is still moving forward with its intention to bring its far pricier (and very handsome) 0 Series sedan and SUV to market later in the decade. “Our plan is to launch the 0 Series according to our current plan,” Mibe said. “However, probably the initial volume will be less than we had imagined earlier.”

At least Honda isn’t planning on pulling a Stellantis, and undermining its electrification efforts by stuffing gas engines into its nominally electric vehicles. “The 0 Series is designed for EVs,” Mibe said when I asked him about this. “So there is no plan to install a hybrid in the 0 Series.”

And while Honda won’t be bringing its adorable, cheap Super-One micro-hotrod EV to the US, it hasn’t ruled out the idea of performance EVs. “I think it remains an important area for racing, so research into EV-based sports cars has continued, and we have many prototypes already made internally,” Mibe said.

The Honda Super One is delightful, but it won't be coming to the U.S.

He even touted a potential electric performance tech transfer derived from Honda’s participation, with Aston Martin, in the forthcoming hybridized F1 season. “In order to win, we must have good EV technology in this power unit. And this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate Honda’s electrification technology.”

Still, don’t get your hopes up for a new electric CRX anytime soon. “Given this slowing down in the electrification market, it’s hard to decide when we would make them available to the market,” Mibe said.

So what is Honda’s electrification strategy?

One word: Hybrids.

“We are thinking of a strategy to increase the number of hybrids,” Mibe said. The first step in this is a complete revamp of the automaker’s hybrid system, which will move to a larger battery pack, coupled to more efficient I-4 and V6 gasoline engines, and, in larger models—including SUVs, trucks, and sedans—seemingly endowed with rear electric motors for all-wheel-drive capabilities. Mibe said that this will occur by 2027, and will offer both savings and benefits. “Hybrid cost will come down by 20%, and the performance will get enhanced.”

For now, Honda is leaning on hybrids to drive its own electrification efforts.

Mibe stated that Honda hoped to increase its global hybrid sales from the current level of around 800,000 units to over 2 million units by 2030. Of course, this alone will not get Honda to its ongoing goals of total carbon neutrality by 2050. “If we look at our North American market as a total, we will maintain at least the current level of carbon or maybe decrease it a little from what it is now,” Mibe said. He vaguely mentioned ideas of biofuels and carbon capture as potential solutions.

Abuelsamid worries about the long-term viability of this focus, especially as it pertains to EV development. “Honda has chosen to split their resources across all of these different pathways—electric vehicles, combustion vehicles, and hybrid vehicles,” he said. “And that makes it more difficult and more challenging to do the longer-term EV stuff when you still also have to do the near-term spending on combustion and hybrid.”

One obvious place where Honda could use its hybrid technology: Its larger vehicles like the Pilot, Passport and Odyssey, which are all powered by old-school naturally aspirated V-6s.

What does all of this mean?

In the short term, it means that Honda, like others in the industry, is seemingly using the current administration’s ill-conceived antipathy to electrification as cover for its ongoing retreat from the category. I’m not convinced this makes good long-term business sense, globally, given the pressures from other markets, including China.

With U.S. automakers pulling EV investment from Canada and Mexico, and moving production to the U.S. to comply with the President, it seems possible that our neighbors will be motivated to collaborate with the Chinese to keep factories running and workers employed. “The Chinese are making really good, lower cost EVs, and if our OEMs don’t keep moving down that path, the Chinese are eventually going to find some pathway into the North American market,” Abuelsamid warned.

Moreover, ignoring the seemingly inevitable progress toward electrification occurring in the rest of the world in favor of abiding by the whims of a capricious and bilious autocrat does not seem strategic. If we are no longer making desirable, global vehicles, Abuelsamid said, “the US becomes an island unto itself. We’ll be stuck with products that no one else in the world wants to buy, we’ll have the Chinese at our front and back doors, and we’re not going to have any product to compete with them here or abroad.”

The solution? Tune out the blather and focus on the big picture. “I think to some degree the industry needs to ignore the noise coming from Washington,” Abuelsamid said. “Clearly the current administration wants them to ignore electrification, ignore sustainability, and ignore climate change. But the rest of the world is not doing that, so they have to continue to invest heavily in all of that.”

Energy Transfer reported net income attributable to partners for the three months ended September 30, 2025 of $1.02 billion compared to $1.18 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net income per common unit (basic) was $0.28.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $3.84 billion compared to $3.96 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners, as adjusted, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.90 billion compared to $1.99 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The decreases in Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners, as adjusted, were driven by the impact of several one-time items during the third quarter of 2025.

Growth capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2025 were $1.14 billion, while maintenance capital expenditures were $293 million.

Operational Highlights

Energy Transfer’s volumes continued to grow during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.

NGL and refined products terminal volumes were up 10%, setting a new Partnership record.

NGL transportation volumes were up 11%, setting a new Partnership record.

NGL exports were up 13%, setting a new Partnership record.

Interstate natural gas transportation volumes were up 8%.

Intrastate natural gas transportation volumes were up 5%.

Midstream gathered volumes were up 3%, setting a new Partnership record.

In November 2025, Energy Transfer announced plans to construct a new 250 MMcf/d processing plant and related facilities in the Midland Basin. Mustang Draw II is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2026.

In September 2025, Energy Transfer executed agreements to expand its Price River Terminal in Utah which will double its export capacity of American Premium Uinta (“APU”) oil. The project includes new railcar loading facilities, a new heated storage tank with approximately 120,000 barrels of capacity and two additional 6,000-foot storage unit tracks.

Energy Transfer is also currently commissioning the third of eight, 10-megawatt natural-gas fired electric generation facilities in West Texas.

Strategic Highlights

Energy Transfer has now executed multiple agreements with Oracle, including previously announced agreements, to supply natural gas to three U.S. data centers, two of which are in Texas. Under these long-term agreements, Energy Transfer will deliver approximately 900 MMcf per day of natural gas. Supply for these agreements is expected to be sourced from our extensive intrastate pipeline network, and construction of a new pipeline lateral from Hugh Brinson and our North Texas pipeline is already underway.

Energy Transfer recently entered into a 20-year binding agreement with Entergy Louisiana to initially provide 250,000 MMBtu per day of firm transportation service to fuel their facilities in Richland Parish, Louisiana, subject to limited conditions precedent. The agreement would begin in December 2028 and includes an option for Entergy to expand the capacity in the future.

In August 2025, in support of customer demand for additional reliable natural gas service, the Partnership announced construction of a new natural gas storage cavern at its Bethel natural gas storage facility, located near Dallas-Fort Worth. The project will double the facility’s natural gas working storage capacity to more than 12 Bcf and is expected to be in service in late 2028.

Financial Highlights

In October 2025, Energy Transfer announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3325 per common unit ($1.33 annualized) for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, which is an increase of more than 3% compared to the third quarter of 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, the Partnership’s revolving credit facility had an aggregate $3.44 billion of available borrowing capacity.

The Partnership now expects to be slightly below the lower end of its previously stated Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion. The Partnership expects its 2025 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $4.6 billion.

In support of the significant strategic growth opportunities, Energy Transfer expects to invest approximately $5 billion of growth capital in 2026. The majority of this capital is expected to be spent on natural gas-directed projects, which will further enhance the Partnership’s leading infrastructure business in Texas and throughout the U.S.

Energy Transfer benefits from a portfolio of assets with exceptional product and geographic diversity. The Partnership’s multiple segments generate high-quality, balanced earnings with no single business segment contributing more than one-third of the Partnership’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025. In addition, Energy Transfer generates approximately 40% of its Adjusted EBITDA from natural gas-related assets. The vast majority of the Partnership’s segment margins are fee-based and therefore have limited commodity price sensitivity.

The following analysis of segment operating results includes a measure of segment margin. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented.

Transported volumes of gas on our Texas intrastate pipelines increased primarily due to more third-party transportation.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impact of the following:

a decrease of $101 million in realized natural gas sales and other primarily due to lower optimization volumes with shifts to long-term third-party contracts from the Permian and narrower price spreads; and

an increase of $11 million in operating expenses primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes and maintenance project costs; partially offset by

an increase of $10 million in transportation fees primarily due to the volume shift to long-term third party contracts from our optimization group on our Texas system; and

an increase of $4 million in retained fuel margin primarily due to higher gas prices.

Transported volumes increased primarily due to more capacity sold and higher utilization on several of our systems due to increased demand.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impact of the following:

an increase of $68 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $43 million increase related to the resolution of a prior period ad valorem tax obligation on our Rover system, an $11 million increase in transportation expense and an aggregate $15 million increase in other items, primarily including ad valorem taxes, maintenance projects and revaluation of system gas; partially offset by

an increase of $28 million in segment margin primarily due to a $25 million increase in transportation revenue from several of our interstate pipeline systems due to higher contracted volumes and a $6 million increase in operational gas sales. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in interruptible usage and parking revenue.

Gathered volumes increased primarily due to newly acquired assets, as well as additional and upgraded plants in the Permian region, partially offset by lower dry gas gathering in the Northeast and Ark-La-Tex regions. NGL production increased primarily due to recently acquired assets and increased Permian plant utilization.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our midstream segment decreased due to the net impact of the following:

a decrease of $70 million in other income due to the recognition of proceeds from a business interruption claim in September 2024;

an increase of $48 million in operating expenses primarily due to recently acquired assets and assets placed in service, as well as the impact of certain estimates recorded in the prior period which were subsequently adjusted. The increase also included a $9 million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $6 million increase related to increased volumes and repairs in the Permian region; and

a decrease of $2 million in segment margin due to lower dry gas volumes in the Northeast and Ark-La-Tex regions; partially offset by

an increase of $34 million in segment margin primarily due to recently acquired assets and higher volumes in the Permian region;

an increase of $7 million in segment margin due to higher natural gas prices of $32 million, partially offset by lower NGL prices of $25 million;

a decrease of $9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a $3 million decrease resulting from one-time expenses in the prior period, as well as a $3 million decrease in legal fees and a $2 million decrease in insurance expenses; and

an increase of $5 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates due to the one-time recognition of fee credits associated with a contract restructuring.

NGL transportation volumes increased primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region. Also, fractionated volumes were slightly lower due to maintenance at our Mont Belvieu fractionation complex in the current period.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to the net impact of the following:

an increase of $92 million in transportation margin primarily due to higher throughput and contractual rate escalations on our Mariner East and our Gulf Coast pipeline systems; and

an increase of $11 million in terminal services margin primarily due to a $6 million increase in fees from loading volumes for export at our Nederland and Marcus Hook terminals and a $5 million increase from higher throughput and storage at our refined product terminals; partially offset by

an increase of $51 million in operating expenses primarily due to $17 million in one-time investigation and remediation costs, a $19 million increase in costs driven by higher volumes across our NGL system, a $6 million increase from the timing of project related expenses, a $4 million increase in ad valorem taxes on assets placed in service and a $4 million increase in employee costs;

a decrease of $9 million in fractionators and refinery services margin primarily due to lower throughput due to more downtime; and

a decrease of $3 million in marketing margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) primarily due to the timing of the gains from the optimization of hedged NGL and refined product inventories.

Crude oil transportation volumes were consistent due to continued growth on our Texas pipeline system, gathering systems and from the ET-S Permian joint venture with Sunoco LP, partially offset by lower volumes on our Bakken Pipeline. Volumes on our Bayou Bridge system were also lower due to higher Gulf Coast refinery maintenance. Crude terminal volumes were lower primarily due to Gulf Coast refinery maintenance and lower volumes received from our Bakken Pipeline system.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment decreased due to the net impact of the following:

a decrease of $18 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities) due to decreased transportation revenue, primarily from our Bakken Pipeline and Bayou Bridge systems; and

an increase of $12 million in operating expenses primarily due to a $4 million increase in maintenance project costs, a $4 million increase in materials costs, a $3 million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $3 million increase in employee costs due to higher headcount; partially offset by

a decrease of $3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower insurance expenses.

The investment in Sunoco LP segment reflects the consolidated results of Sunoco LP.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our investment in Sunoco LP segment increased due to the net impact of the following:

an increase of $29 million in segment margin (excluding unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments) primarily due to increased fuel volumes and increased margin from transmix and blending activities;

an increase of $11 million in Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates related to ET-S Permian; and

a decrease of $5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense, primarily due to one-time NuStar acquisition costs incurred in 2024; partially offset by

an increase of $12 million in operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expenses, due to an increase in operating expenses from the timing of the acquisitions of NuStar and Zenith European terminals.

The investment in USAC segment reflects the consolidated results of USAC.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our investment in USAC segment increased due to an increase in segment margin primarily due to higher market-based and CPI-based rates.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our all other segment increased due to the net impact of the following:

an increase of $8 million due to lower acquisition-related expenses;

an increase of $7 million in lease income on recently acquired assets; and

an increase of $5 million in our dual drive compression business due to higher service fee revenue; partially offset by

a decrease of $11 million due to an increase in the intersegment elimination from increased earnings of Sunoco LP’s 32.5% share of ET-S Permian, which is consolidated in our crude oil transportation and services segment and reflected as an unconsolidated affiliate in our investment in Sunoco LP segment; and",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20251105661225/en/686926/22/Energy_Transfer_Logo_Horizontal_Stack.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 19:00:48.200629

The investment in Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies is the latest stake taken by the U.S. in a handful of private companies — including another rare earths company and chipmaker Intel — since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. The White House has made it a priority to bolster the nation’s supply chain in a market dominated by China.

Rare earths are used in fighter jets, guided missiles, drones and nuclear submarines as well as smartphones and wind turbines.

The influx of cash will allow Vulcan and ReElement to ramp up their annual magnet production to 10,000 tonnes annually, the companies said.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

The deal announced this week comes just days after Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed to cut tariffs on China, which Beijing reciprocated by allowing the export of rare earth elements.

Before Xi and Trump met last week, China had imposed restrictions that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China, even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies. However, it didn’t eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his initial round of tariffs.

China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

The deal includes a $620 million loan from the Department of Defense, $50 million of federal incentives from the Department of Commerce and $550 million in private capital.

The Defense Department will receive warrants in both Vulcan and ReElement, with Commerce getting a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan.

In July, the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine. The unusual direct investment in the company made the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials.

A week later, MP Materials announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.

U.S. Steel, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals are among the companies the U.S. government has taken equity stakes in under Trump.

Those investments have drawn skepticism from economists, former government officials and even members of the president’s own party.

While it’s not unprecedented for the government to offer financial support to business and industries, historically those investments usually came during major economic crises.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Rare-Earths.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 19:00:35.950029

The 24% month-over-month decline in EV sales isn’t just a statistic—it’s proof that American EV adoption remains heavily dependent on government subsidies.
We predicted this collapse back in June when Senate Republicans first pushed to end the tax credit.","U.S. motor vehicle sales plummeted in October 2025 as the elimination of federal EV tax credits sent electric vehicle demand into freefall and broader economic uncertainty kept car shoppers away from dealerships. The data reveals the immediate aftermath of one of the most significant policy shifts in American automotive history.

Light vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units last month, according to market analysis firm Omdia. This marks the lowest sales pace in 15 months and represents a stark 4.5% decline compared to October 2024. The drop signals that the automotive market’s brief summer surge has given way to a prolonged slowdown driven by policy changes and mounting economic pressures.

Electric Vehicle Sales Collapse Following Tax Credit Elimination

The most dramatic decline came in the electric vehicle segment. Unadjusted sales of electric vehicles dropped to 74,897 units in October from 98,289 units in September—a stunning 24% collapse in just one month. The timing directly correlates with the September 30, 2025 expiration of federal EV incentives.

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” approved by Congress and signed into law on July 4, 2025, eliminated the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and the $4,000 used-EV credit. These subsidies, implemented during the Biden administration, had been instrumental in driving EV adoption over the past several years by reducing the effective purchase price for consumers.

Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Financial, directly attributed October’s weakness to the policy change.

“Sharply lower electric vehicle sales, following the expiration of the federal tax credit on October 1, reduced dealer volumes over the month,” Ayers said in comments reported by Reuters. “With concerns about the labor market building, the near-term outlook for auto sales could be soft as more consumers stay away from auto showrooms this holiday season.”

Economic Headwinds Compound Sales Pressures

Beyond the EV tax credit expiration, multiple economic factors are converging to suppress vehicle demand. The overall unadjusted light vehicle sales declined 4.5% year-over-year in October, suggesting the slowdown extends beyond just electric vehicles.

The labor market has shown signs of weakening, with layoffs remaining relatively low but hiring activity tepid. Economists cited by multiple sources point to economic uncertainty, the impact of tariffs on vehicle prices, and companies increasingly embracing artificial intelligence as factors reducing demand for labor. These conditions are making consumers more cautious about major purchases like vehicles.

Adding to the uncertainty, a 35-day federal government shutdown—on track to become the longest in U.S. history—has created an economic data blackout. Last month’s sharp decline in retail vehicle sales would typically trigger detailed government analysis, but the shutdown has halted normal economic reporting. The Chicago Federal Reserve estimated that retail sales excluding motor vehicles increased just 0.3% in October after a projected 0.4% gain in September, but comprehensive data remains unavailable.

Consumer Sentiment And Labor Market Concerns Mount

Labor market stagnation has persisted since August, with economists identifying several contributing factors. A Conference Board survey last month showed consumers’ perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October, with the unemployment rate near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.

Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, warned of additional challenges ahead.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” Zwemmer said. “New vehicles are one of the most exposed sectors to tariffs. So far, foreign and domestic automakers have largely absorbed the costs through their profit margins, but this isn’t sustainable.”

The combination of higher effective vehicle prices (due to the loss of EV tax credits), ongoing tariff pressures, elevated interest rates, and labor market concerns creates a particularly challenging environment for automotive sales heading into the traditionally strong holiday shopping season.

September Pre-Buy Surge Creates October Hangover

The October decline was partially predictable. Throughout August and September, industry analysts and EVXL warned of an impending “pre-buy” surge as consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the September 30 deadline. That surge materialized, with EV sales spiking in the third quarter and pulling forward demand that would have otherwise occurred in Q4.

Multiple automakers offered aggressive incentives in the weeks leading up to the deadline, with Tesla prominently displaying banners warning buyers to “Take Delivery by September 30, 2025” to secure the $7,500 credit. The resulting September sales boom left dealerships with depleted inventory and consumers who might have purchased in October or November having already completed their transactions.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking this story for months, and October’s numbers validate every warning we issued. Back in early July, we reported on the impending September 30 deadline and predicted exactly this pattern: a rush of purchases before the cutoff followed by a dramatic sales collapse.

The 24% month-over-month decline in EV sales isn’t just a statistic—it’s proof that American EV adoption remains heavily dependent on government subsidies. When you effectively raise the price of every EV by $7,500 overnight, demand craters. This wasn’t a surprise to anyone paying attention.

What makes this particularly significant is the timing. Just one week before these October sales figures emerged, we reported on GM laying off 3,300 EV workers and idling battery plants that had received billions in investment. GM CEO Mary Barra told shareholders that EVs “remain our North Star” during the company’s Q3 earnings call, yet the automaker slashed EV production capacity by 50% at its flagship Factory Zero plant within weeks.

This disconnect between corporate messaging and actual behavior is a pattern we’ve documented repeatedly. When Ford faced a supplier crisis, the company immediately prioritized gas-powered F-150 production over the electric F-150 Lightning. Both GM and Ford are revealing their true priorities when market conditions tighten: profitable internal combustion engines win every time.

The broader context matters too. We’re now in the midst of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history—35 days and counting—which began on October 1, the exact same day the tax credits expired. This isn’t just creating economic uncertainty; it’s producing a data blackout precisely when we need transparency about how consumers are responding to these dramatic policy shifts.

The path forward looks increasingly challenging. Without the $7,500 credit, EVs must compete on price and merit alone against gas-powered vehicles. Some manufacturers like Hyundai responded by slashing prices on the 2026 Ioniq 5 by nearly $10,000, but those price cuts eat directly into already-thin margins. How long can automakers sustain that approach?

We predicted this collapse back in June when Senate Republicans first pushed to end the tax credit. The question now is whether the industry can stabilize or if we’re looking at a multi-year setback for EV adoption in America while China continues to dominate global EV production with robust government support.

As always, the event emphasized that conservatives and Republicans should and do care about climate. As he described the event in his newsletter, “It’s primarily for conservatives, but we have people here from every stripe. And the main point to conservatives is this is a good way to engage, to show how much we do care about leaving the earth better than we found it, and that you don’t have to leave your conservative values behind to do it.” David Ryser, a resident of Sandy, Utah, affirmed Sen. Curtis’ comments in an opinion piece published in Deseret News, “I’ve attended every summit, and Curtis’s goal has been clear: bring conservatives to the table to lead on practical climate solutions.”

“Not only do you not have to give up your conservative credentials to be good at this,” Curtis added, “We actually have some really good ideas,” and, “We’re going to come up with different answers that you typically have seen because we’re conservative.” He told ABC4, “I think it’s important – the word ‘conservative’ is very, very important. It was essential, as we started doing this, that we were differentiating ourselves as a different voice in this space.” He pointed out the importance of having a seat at the table, because, “when you’re not here, people are making decisions for you that you don’t like.” As Heather Reams, President and CEO of the Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) Forum, summarized in a panel at the summit, “The climate changing is a really big challenge globally, and one side of the aisle shouldn’t be solving the problem. Like hard issues, we should be solving the problem by working together in Congress and legislatures.”

With every year’s event, Sen. Curtis wins more conservatives over to the climate cause. “Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it,’ and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we care deeply about the Earth,” Curtis described. With 600 people in attendance this year, the potential impact is enormous.

The growth in conservative support for climate issues is also evident in the Conservative Climate Caucus. In 2021, then-Representative Curtis founded the caucus to educate House Republicans on climate policies and legislation that align with their values and to bring Republicans to the table in these discussions. He reminisced, “From the first time I muttered ‘climate’, I’ve been dealing with an uphill battle.” When he first surfaced the idea of the caucus, he added, “My team said, that’s great, John, you’ll get four or five Republicans that will join that. When I left the House of Representatives last year, 85 House Republicans had joined.”

At the summit, Sen. Curtis also shared that his own passion for climate issues came from his father, who “didn’t know it, but he was an environmentalist.” He described, “I remember my father just instilling in me this sense of the grandeur of this earth and how lucky we were to be in Utah.”

Among the primary topics at the event was America’s energy needs. One of the more prominent attendees, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, explained, “We all want a cleaner, healthier world, with a great future for our kids and grandchildren, and we want to energize the world.” He commented, “To build energy, you need to build big things” domestically instead of outsourcing them to other countries with lower environmental standards. “Green is to build these energy-intensive and large physical materials in our own states, with great regulations and great innovation, and in a clean fashion.”

As Sen. Curtis told reporters after last year’s summit, “I believe that there is a solution for energy needs that’s affordable, reliable and clean, doesn’t leave us dependent on another country for fuel and is right in harmony with conservative values.” This year, he stated, “The market is driving three things: affordable energy, reliable energy, and clean energy. And if you think government can out-regulate that, I believe you’re wrong.” Essentially, “We need every electron we can get.” Sen. Curtis also expressed his concerns about the Department of Energy’s recent termination of $7.5 billion in awards to clean energy projects.

CEO and General Manager of Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), a joint action agency that helps members meet their wholesale power needs, Mason Baker explained that the organization’s strategy is a “portfolio-based approach to developing resources,” which he described as similar to the “all-of-the-above strategy.” Essentially, a diverse mix of resources “can result in the most economic, affordable, long-term, sustainable power supply for the members.” It entails avoiding overreliance on a single approach amid changing administrations every four years, enabling pivots in response to changing weather, and maintaining fuel diversity to meet a quickly escalating energy demand. In a panel discussion, Jayson Branch, vice president of finance at PacifiCorp, detailed how different resources can interplay well together: “We’ve used our thermal resources like coal generation or gas generation. We’ve changed our speeds at which we can ramp those resources up and down… It allows us to integrate more and more renewables, which are obviously free energy resources, into the system.” Sen. Curtis concluded, “I’ve learned along the way that you don’t rule out any energy sector.”

Sen. Curtis addressed some of the criticisms of energy sources, noting that renewables are improving reliability issues by adding storage, that we will solve the cost issues surrounding nuclear, and that “there is a role for fossil fuels in our energy future” with technologies like carbon sequestration and direct air capture. Secretary Wright expressed support for specific technologies, like small modular reactors and power purchase agreements for nuclear. Secretary Wright elaborated, “We are going to see a nuclear renaissance. Utah is absolutely going to be a key part of that… Nuclear’s going to become sexy again.” He added, “I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal. And frankly, Utah is the leader in that.” Sarah Jewett, senior vice president of strategy at geothermal company Fervo Energy, explained that “geothermal energy is an incredible solution that is not in the future, but it is here today. It is a baseload, reliable solution that is rapidly becoming more affordable… Geothermal power is about to proliferate in a really, really meaningful way, and Utah is the place where that proliferation will begin.”

Permitting and quick project builds were also central topics. UAMPS’s Baker emphasized, “As we think about trying to keep up with the demand that’s coming, we have to get faster at permitting these projects… And once these projects are permitted, we need to have comfort that the permits are going to be honored.” Reneging on permits, like that of Revolution Wind, will create investment uncertainty and ultimately drive prices up. Secretary Wright explained that permitting reform needs to be bipartisan, “Real permitting reform means both of the major political parties come together to discuss what their are, what they think the roadblocks are to development of this infrastructure, and how can we make it easier.” He also advocated for “energy addition, not energy subtraction,” noting, “We’re doing everything we can to get new generation on the grid as fast as possible. We’re doing things to get more power generation out of existing assets.” After attending the event, Sandy, Utah resident Marc Peterson wrote in a letter to the editor published in the Salt Lake Tribune, “I appreciated the focus on building all available technologies as quickly as possible.”

Among the other topics at the summit were healthy forests and wildfire mitigation. In April, Sen. Curtis introduced the Senate version of the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act, alongside Senators Tim Sheehy (R-MT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Alex Padilla (D-CA). Among other initiatives, the legislation would establish programs to reduce wildfire risks in high-priority “firesheds,” deploy research and demonstration initiatives for wildfire prevention, detection, and mitigation technologies, create a Wildfire Intelligence Center that would streamline federal response, and expand support for projects that protect forest health and contribute to reforestation. On October 21, the bill advanced through the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.

In a panel discussion at the summit, Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s Devlin Daneshforouz explained the importance of the legislation from the utilities’ perspective: “It allows us to do more of the wildfire mitigation work that we need to do, quicker. Wildfire seasons are getting longer, and the periods where we can operate and do the work needed to prevent them from happening are getting shorter.” The company plans to invest more than $2 billion in this type of work by 2027. Matt Weiner, from the nonprofit Megafire Action, added that the average wildfire permitting process takes about 1,000 days, pointing to the Forest Service’s fuel break maintenance strategy, announced in 2020, which took four years to approve. Notably, $9 million of treatment work could have saved $40 billion in damage resulting from this year’s Eaton fire in Los Angeles.

In a call with reporters, Sen. Curtis explained, “It’s about managing our forest in a way that is in harmony with those who definitely want to preserve and protect them, and by the way, count me as one of those. But also in a way that doesn’t tie hands, that helps these people make good decisions and do so quicker.” This is especially essential following the release of the Utah Wildfire Annual Report, which found a 54% increase in wildfires over the past year. At the summit, Sen. Curtis said of the bill’s likelihood of passage, “I think the odds are very, very high.”

Several participants have recognized the importance of the summit. Stewardship Utah’s Eliza Cowie told FOX 13 News, “I think it is an important step in a larger process of addressing our climate solutions.” Carmen Val Dez, senior policy associate with the Healthy Environmental Alliance of Utah, added, “Climate doesn’t impact just one party or the other.”

In his op-ed, Sandy resident David Ryser reflected, “Sen. Curtis deserves credit for involving conservatives in climate discussions. Utahns want leaders who champion innovation, protect our land, and provide energy that is safe, healthy, and economical. By embracing all practical solutions and letting free markets work, conservatives can lead — demonstrating that caring for the land we cherish is a truly conservative principle.”

As Sen. Curtis summarized after the event, “The Conservative Climate Summit continues to show that conservatives are leading with practical, durable solutions for our environment and economy. Utahns care deeply about clean air, healthy forests, and reliable, affordable energy—and we know those goals are not in conflict. By championing innovation, empowering local communities, and responsible land and resource management, we can protect what makes Utah special without sacrificing our prosperity. The summit is about action over ideology, and this year’s program proved no different.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/G39QO2lXQAELfyP-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 18:19:47.652669

This applies not only to electricity supply, but also to district heating, gas infrastructure and charging points for electric vehicles, the advisory body consisting of economists and legal experts concluded.
In the electricity sector, “dynamic grid fees” and progressive digitalisation are seen as key steps.
Dynamic grid fees could help steer supply and demand and ultimately allow for “a happy hour” for electricity consumers, Duso argued.
“We need a targeted decommissioning of gas grids as well as binding plans by grid operators,” Duso said.","The transition to renewable power sources requires a comprehensive reform of the electricity system in Germany to better align prices with power output, the country’s monopoly commission has said in an expert opinion on the energy sector for the government.

“Only by tackling the root causes of high energy prices can we achieve durable changes. Merely doctoring symptoms is not enough,” said commission head Tomaso Duso. More competition and more efficiency are needed to make the energy transition a success, the competition watchdog found. This applies not only to electricity supply, but also to district heating, gas infrastructure and charging points for electric vehicles, the advisory body consisting of economists and legal experts concluded.

In the electricity sector, “dynamic grid fees” and progressive digitalisation are seen as key steps. “The system currently rewards a behaviour that brings grids to their limits,” commission leader Duso said. Today’s grid fees would not offer incentives for using available grid capacity more efficiently, leading to curtailment of wind power in northern Germany while gas or coal plants are fired up in the south. Dynamic grid fees could help steer supply and demand and ultimately allow for “a happy hour” for electricity consumers, Duso argued. A digitalised grid would allow for introducing more flexible fees – and could help the country avoid the “politically difficult” debate about splitting into multiple power price zones, he added.

The monopoly commission also lamented a lack of competition among operators of EV charging infrastructure, especially along Germany’s motorways, where most projects were awarded to the same company without a tendering process. The commission called for more tenders and welcomed the planned launch of a price transparency office for customers. A similar price transparency platform would be needed for district heating, where monopolies are becoming a risk due to the disappearance of oil and gas heaters. At the same time, more and more gas grids will fall idle as customers switch to other heating technologies, raising the question of who pays for phasing out the obsolete infrastructure. “We need a targeted decommissioning of gas grids as well as binding plans by grid operators,” Duso said.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-11-05 16:19:47.809206

Storage revenue surges

Nevada-based Ormat is an independent power producer that operates a 1.6-GW portfolio of geothermal, waste heat recovery, solar and energy storage resources with assets in the United States, Kenya, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It aims to nearly double its energy generation and storage capacity by the end of 2028, executives said on a third-quarter earnings call Tuesday.

Ormat earned $24.1 million profit in the third quarter, up 9.3% from $22.1 million a year ago. Its Q3 2025 revenue was $249.7 million, an increase of nearly 18% from the third quarter of 2024.

Ormat saw strong performance in its products and energy storage segments, which respectively account for 25% and 8% of its total sales. Storage was the standout, posting 108% growth year over year thanks to favorable seasonality and higher capacity prices in the PJM Interconnection.

The electricity segment accounts for 67% of Ormat’s sales. It was noticeably weaker this quarter due to a September storm that knocked out the grid near the company’s southern California assets, curtailments related to transmission upgrades in Nevada and lower energy prices in Hawaii.

On Tuesday, Ormat Chief Financial Officer Assaf Ginzburg said the curtailments could cost Ormat $40 million to $50 million this year. But CEO Doron Blachar characterized the issues as one-offs and said the company did not expect a repeat in 2026.

Ormat expects to book about $167 million from tax equity financing and tax credit transfer transactions this year, higher than previously forecast. It sees $50.4 million in net tax benefits from the investment and production tax credits for energy storage and geothermal authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and extended in full through 2033 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Ormat expects to grow its energy generation and storage capacity by 15% to 17% annually through 2028. In its core electricity segment, it sees 162 MW of solar growth and 240 MW to 340 MW of geothermal growth. Though a significant portion of its planned geothermal additions are slated for non-U.S. markets like Indonesia, Blachar said Ormat feels good about its projects in resource-rich Nevada despite a recent 10-fold increase in geothermal proposals entering NV Energy’s interconnection queue.

Updates on two enhanced geothermal partnerships

Ormat announced enhanced geothermal, or EGS, partnerships with SLB and Sage Geosystems earlier this year.

“We have achieved significant progress in advancing our EGS strategy,” Blachar said on Tuesday. He cautioned, however, that the partnerships likely would not accrue to Ormat’s capacity pipeline until after 2028.

The SLB partnership is a joint venture that Blachar said would blend SLB’s drilling and subsurface engineering expertise with Ormat’s thermal power plant design, development and operation. The first phase is a pilot project that could be operational in late 2026 at Ormat’s Desert Peak plant in Nevada — a significantly shorter headway than building a new facility for the project. If successful, Ormat and SLB would jointly develop commercial-scale power plants for independent power producers, utilities and large industrial customers.

The Sage pilot would follow a similar timeline, but the Texas-based startup is still deciding on a site, Blachar said. In August, Sage CEO Cindy Taff told Latitude Media that it was considering three sites in Nevada and Utah. If the pilot pans out, Ormat could then develop, build, own and operate geothermal power plants and energy storage facilities — including long-duration storage — using Sage’s EGS technology.

In both cases, Blachar said, each commercial-scale EGS facility could have hundreds of megawatts of capacity, compared with a few tens of megawatts at most traditional geothermal sites.

But that base is growing quickly as Ormat plans to add 660 MW to 760 MW of capacity over the next three years, upsizing its storage portfolio from 290 MW today to as much as 1,050 MW by the end of 2028. Ormat commissioned a 60 MW/120 MWh project in Texas last quarter and plans to bring an additional 175 MW/580 MWh online across three projects in California and Texas by the end of 2026.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s foreign sourcing rules remain a concern for Ormat given industrywide dependence on Chinese components, Blachar said.

The coming weeks – the G20 Africa Energy Investment Forum and the G20 Summit – will test whether words can translate into tangible action.","As leaders prepare to gather for the G20 Summit in South Africa, an urgent and pragmatic conversation is taking shape: how to harness natural gas and LPG as immediate, scalable solutions to deliver power and clean cooking across Africa – and, in doing so, make energy poverty history. The African Energy Chamber (AEC) will bring this debate to the forefront at the G20 Africa Energy Investment Forum in Johannesburg on November 21, serving as a key follow-up to African Energy Week and a precursor to the G20 Summit.

Why Gas and Clean Cooking?

Nearly one billion people in Africa still lack access to clean cooking solutions, with devastating health, economic and environmental consequences. International agencies have highlighted that accelerating investments in clean-cooking fuels – including LPG – is one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives, reduce indoor air pollution and relieve women and girls from the daily burden of collecting fuel. The IEA has underscored that scaling clean-cooking investment can materially move the continent toward universal access.

At the same time, natural gas offers a near-term route to expand reliable electricity access. New gas-fired power plants, distributed gas-to-power projects and smaller-scale gas solutions can be deployed faster than many large renewables-plus-storage models, especially where grid expansion and storage remain constrained. For countries with domestic reserves or proximate pipeline and LNG infrastructure, gas can underpin industrialization – powering factories, processing plants and agriculture – and support the broader economic transformation that sustained energy access requires.

A Realistic, African-led Approach

The AEC and African Energy Week have pushed a pragmatic message: Africa’s energy strategy should be determined by its priorities – development, jobs and access – rather than a one-size-fits-all decarbonization timetable. The upcoming G20 forum is designed to translate that pragmatism into investment commitments, linking G20 capital and policy dialogue with concrete projects on the ground. AEW’s recent programming and the forum’s launch materials emphasize deal-making, infrastructure and scaled solutions for both power and clean cooking.

“Some 750,000 to one million Africans die every year from lack of clean cooking fuels – and this must end,” states NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the AEC. “LPG is a proven, affordable solution that can save lives today while building the foundation for a cleaner energy future. Africa will lead this change. We are going to use LPG, scale it across the continent and we will not stop.”

The challenge – and the opportunity – is turning calls for LPG and gas-to-power into bankable projects that attract G20 investors. That requires coordinated policy frameworks, public-private partnerships to de-risk early projects and targeted finance instruments that make small-scale clean-cooking businesses and LPG distribution commercially viable. The forum on November 21 will be an important test of whether the G20 and African partners can align on investment vehicles that accommodate the continent’s need for pragmatic transition solutions while attracting capital at scale.

Making Energy Poverty History

For Africa, ending energy poverty is a development imperative. Faster access to power through gas-to-power, paired with rapid roll-out of clean cooking fuels like LPG, can produce immediate health, economic and gender-equity benefits while giving countries the fiscal space to scale renewables and storage over time. For investors and G20 partners, the appeal is twofold: these are high-impact, near-term interventions with clear social returns, and they create the infrastructure backbone for a longer-term, diversified energy mix.

The coming weeks – the G20 Africa Energy Investment Forum and the G20 Summit – will test whether words can translate into tangible action. The forum’s focus on advancing pragmatic, African-led investments in gas-to-power and clean cooking solutions marks meaningful progress toward making energy poverty a challenge of the past rather than a defining feature of Africa’s future.",https://energychamber.org/wp-content/uploads/Clean-cooking-aec.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 00:58:22.308727

According to Ellis, California now imports about one million barrels of oil per day, with roughly 20 percent of its jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel coming from India—where about 40 percent of crude oil originates from Russia.
“If our defenses can’t fly when needed and we only have a three-day fuel supply—we’re in bad shape,” he said.
Supervisor Phillip Peters added that Kern County is also pursuing designation as a natural resource development zone to reaffirm its strategic importance to U.S. energy and aviation fuel security.

According to Ellis, California now imports about one million barrels of oil per day, with roughly 20 percent of its jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel coming from India—where about 40 percent of crude oil originates from Russia.

Supply Strain and Security Concerns

Ellis told supervisors that several U.S. military installations, including Travis Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, rely almost entirely on California refineries for jet fuel.

“If our defenses can’t fly when needed and we only have a three-day fuel supply—we’re in bad shape,” he said.

Kern County Seeks Federal Action

Supervisor David Couch introduced a motion supporting a white paper co-authored by Ellis and two other state lawmakers, California Energy and Fuel Policies: A Clear and Present Threat to National Security and Force Readiness. The motion, approved unanimously, directs the county to send letters urging federal review of California’s refining and energy regulations to the president, Congress, and the governor.

Supervisor Phillip Peters added that Kern County is also pursuing designation as a natural resource development zone to reaffirm its strategic importance to U.S. energy and aviation fuel security.

Ellis said the solution to relieving the state’s aviation fuel strain lies in easing restrictions on oil and gas producers to maintain refinery operations and stabilize supply chains.

“There are some solutions,” he said. “The solutions are, simply get rid of some of the regulation through federalizing oil and gas. If we can do that and we can empower the other areas in the state to produce diesel, and we can get some of the air regs off of our refineries. Guess what? We win,” he said.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/AD32_StanEllis_2-768x678-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:06:24.749609

Litter does more than just look bad. It harms wildlife and ecosystems, lowers property values, increases cleanup costs, and can even block storm drains, causing flooding. Chemicals and microplastics from litter also contaminate soil and water, creating long-term environmental damage.

That’s why organizations like Keep Tiger Town Beautiful and Keep Jaguar Nation Beautiful are leading the charge for a cleaner, greener Baton Rouge and why Entergy Louisiana was proud to join them.

Entergy volunteers kicked off day one in Tigerland alongside Keep Tiger Town Beautiful. The volunteer-led group of “litter warriors” hosts weekly cleanups across Baton Rouge and provides supplies for anyone interested in organizing their own event.

What began as a typical cleanup quickly turned into a treasure hunt. Alongside the usual bottles, cans, and paper, volunteers collected doors, a shopping cart, window blinds, and even children’s toys. By the end of the morning, more than 20 bags of trash were cleared from the neighborhood.

“Entergy’s support is such a blessing for our team and our city. Their investment helps us maintain a clean, healthy city residents can take pride in,” said Jennifer Richardson, Keep Tiger Town Beautiful founder.

The following day, Entergy volunteers showed up to support Keep Jaguar Nation, a part of Scotlandville Community Development Corporation’s efforts to address the pressing issue of blight and environmental neglect in the Scotlandville neighborhood of North Baton Rouge. This initiative mobilizes residents through organized cleanup events, fostering collaboration and neighborhood pride while transforming neglected areas into cleaner, safer, and more welcoming spaces.

“Partners like Entergy provide generous financial support so we can purchase supplies for our cleanups, and they come with an employee volunteer group to help us tackle and complete large tasks,” said Pat McCallister-LeDuff, Scotlandville CDC President. “Entergy is a great community partner that is bringing our neighborhoods out of darkness.”

“It was an honor to volunteer today,” said Joseph Williams IV, Choctaw Storekeeper. “Giving back to the Scotlandville community was especially meaningful as a former resident. I’m already looking forward to the next event.”

EBR Mayor-President’s office, Metropolitan Councilmembers as well as Baton Rouge Police Department, and Baton Rouge Fire Department representatives also rolled up their sleeves to support the cleanup effort.

To help sustain these important community initiatives, Entergy Louisiana contributed $5,000 to both Keep Tiger Town Beautiful and Keep Jaguar Nation Beautiful. Together, we’re not just cleaning streets, we’re strengthening communities, protecting the environment, and powering a brighter, cleaner Baton Rouge through hands-on community action.

Will it be permanent legislation that is updated periodically?

This is an interesting question that I have received numerous times since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). It’s an excellent and very forward-looking question about the future of U.S. agricultural policy. My thoughts are that, based on the nature and scope of the OBBBA, it is unlikely that the stand-alone, comprehensive Farm Bill will be eliminated entirely in the near future. However, the OBBBA has fundamentally changed the landscape.

Rationale for Expecting a Stand-Alone Farm Bill

Significant Provisions Remain Outside OBBBA. While the OBBBA included major, multi-year extensions and enhancements to core areas like Commodity Programs (ARC, PLC), Crop Insurance, and certain Tax Provisions for agriculture, it left several critical titles and programs either partially addressed or untouched. These include:

Conservation (many programs, despite some funding being extended by the Inflation Reduction Act)

Nutrition (like SNAP, although OBBBA may have included budget-related changes)

Rural Development

Research, Extension, and Education

Forestry

Horticulture/Specialty Crops

The Need for Bipartisan Updates. The traditional Farm Bill process is a rare instance of comprehensive, bipartisan legislation. Agricultural committees in Congress are generally motivated to draft and pass a full bill to address new issues and fine-tune existing programs across all titles, a process that a large, omnibus bill like OBBBA often bypasses.

Talk of a “Skinny Farm Bill.” Following OBBBA’s passage, there have been discussions in Congress about passing a “skinny Farm Bill” to reauthorize the programs that the OBBBA did not include or fully address, indicating that the full process is still seen as necessary.

The Nature of Future Legislation

The OBBBA is seen as extending and making some farm policy changes permanent or long-term (e.g., through 2031 for some commodity programs). The Farm Bill is not permanent legislation in the sense of never expiring. Congress typically writes a new bill every five or six years, suspending the old, permanent law (from the 1930s and 40s) for the duration of the new bill. The OBBBA’s actions effectively act as a very long-term extension and update for its included titles. Because the OBBBA resolved some of the most expensive and contentious titles (Commodity and Crop Insurance) for several years, it may reduce the urgency and political leverage for future stand-alone Farm Bills. Future Farm Bills will now likely start with the policies established by the OBBBA as their new baseline, focusing their debates and funding changes on the remaining titles and any new issues that emerge.

Specific Farm Bill Titles or Programs Not Included in the OBBBA

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) focused primarily on the titles of the Farm Bill that have direct budgetary impacts and could be passed through the reconciliation process. Indeed, the OBBBA, in its agricultural provisions, focused heavily on the major spending titles. As a result, many other important titles from the 2018 Farm Bill (and previous versions) were not fully reauthorized or were only partially addressed, leaving programs for a future bill.

The key Farm Bill titles and areas that were generally not included or were left for a separate, traditional Farm Bill, often referred to as a “skinny Farm Bill,” are as follows:

Title III: Trade:

While OBBBA may have created or adjusted some trade promotion funding (like a new Agricultural Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program), the full reauthorization of key programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMD) was largely left out or addressed only as part of a temporary or replacement measure.

Title V: Credit:

Programs for farm credit, which provide government-backed loans and guarantees, were generally not the primary focus of the OBBBA’s agricultural title.

Title VII: Research, Extension, and Related Matters:

Many of the core research and extension programs and institutions (like funding for land-grant universities, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, and various research agencies) were not comprehensively reauthorized, though some targeted research funding for specialty crops and facilities may have been included.

Title VIII: Forestry:

The Forestry title, which deals with public and private forest land management, was mostly excluded. For example, the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program, which provides payments to counties with federal forestland, was specifically noted as being handled in separate legislation.

Title IX: Energy:

The Energy title programs, which support renewable energy and bio-based products, were generally not the focus of the OBBBA, though changes to tax credits (like the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit) did have energy implications.

Title XII: Miscellaneous (Including many “Orphan Programs”):

This title includes a wide array of programs for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, livestock and poultry disease preparedness, and other assistance that are often considered “orphan programs.” Many of these programs were not addressed in the OBBBA and required separate action.

Key Reason for Exclusion

The primary reason these titles were often excluded is that the OBBBA was passed through the budget reconciliation process. This process is limited by the Byrd Rule, which means that most provisions must directly affect federal spending or revenues and cannot primarily be matters of policy. Many of the programs in the excluded titles are either:

Policy-focused, not directly budgetary.

Discretionary spending programs, which do not have the same immediate budgetary impact as mandatory programs, such as commodities and SNAP.

In short, a subsequent “skinny Farm Bill” would likely be needed to address the policy updates and fully reauthorize these other crucial titles.

Conclusion

It is highly likely that there will be a stand-alone Farm Bill in the future, but its focus and scope may differ due to the OBBBA. It will remain temporary legislation that will be updated periodically (typically every five years), but key parts of the farm safety net are now secured for a longer time horizon than usual.",https://rfdtv.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/fca47d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/794x446+58+0/resize/730x410!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrightspot-go-k1-rfdtv.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F2e%2F407ac341454aa4753964057a84a4%2F8-farm-bill-hope.JPG,N,,2025-11-05 17:00:34.716408

According to the recently released 2025 Clean Jobs Midwest-Minnesota report , nearly 64,000 Minnesotans now work in fields such as energy efficiency, wind and solar development, electric vehicles, and grid modernization. These are family-supporting jobs that exist in every part of the state, from Duluth and elsewhere in Greater Minnesota to the Twin Cities — and they continue to grow twice as fast as the overall economy.

This success is not an accident. It is the direct result of consistent, forward-looking energy policy at the state level. By setting a clear path to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, Minnesota has created the market confidence that businesses and workers need to invest and grow.

That stability is more important than ever. At the federal level, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed earlier this year abruptly ends tax incentives for energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and wind and solar technologies. When the clean-electricity investment and production tax credits were signed into law in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, they were designed to support an all-of-the-above approach to electricity generation as well as storage technologies, as long as they produced electricity with no emissions. They also provided market participants with a decade of certainty regarding the phaseout of the tax credits, which was scheduled to begin in 2032.

However, the act specifically targeted only clean-energy technologies for rapid phaseout, with electric vehicle tax credits already ended and accelerated expiration timelines for other clean technologies, hampering American energy innovation and increasing energy costs for consumers. This kind of policy whiplash makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan and invest in hiring new workers, as well as developing capital and time-intensive projects that benefit our local communities and ensure a low-cost, flexible, and resilient energy system.

In the midst of all the uncertainty caused by federal-policy instability, Minnesota’s commitment to a steady clean-energy transition has and will continue to be critical in helping shield our state from volatility. By investing in low-cost and reliable energy efficiency, renewable energy, storage, and a portfolio of other clean-energy technologies, we are not only creating local jobs but keeping energy costs affordable for families and businesses.

In fact, a recent Politico analysis of federal data found that states investing most heavily in wind and solar have lower electricity costs. The data confirm what Minnesotans are already experiencing: Innovative clean-energy technologies make our energy system more reliable, more resilient, and more affordable over time.

As energy demand is projected to rise dramatically in the years ahead — especially with the growth of artificial intelligence, data centers, and electrification — the role and skills of clean-energy workers will only become more vital. These are the people building the infrastructure that will power our future while growing and strengthening our economy and energy independence.

Minnesota’s record-setting year for clean-energy jobs is proof that when we combine clear policy direction with local innovation and determination, we can lead through uncertainty and come out stronger. Our clean-energy workforce is one that all Minnesotans should be proud of, building new technologies and a more stable and prosperous future for all citizens of our state.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/570e8f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1807x1135+0+0/resize/1697x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F4a%2F6cf25f354ec9b972ef274560bf25%2F110625-op-dnt-masttoon.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:06:00.867735

For example, the IU Health Incubator at IU LAB will assist up to 40 human health biosciences startups per year and help them grow into major companies.
Last month, IU LAB's LifeTech Accelerator launched in partnership with Plug and Play, BioCrossroads and IU Health.
IU LAB also works to bring IU research to market.
IU is at the nexus of Indiana's progress, aligning industry, research and talent to solve tomorrow's problems today.","The IU Impact: IU is changing the way higher education works with industry. By producing research partnerships and academic pathways, we're translating our discoveries to the real world and training students to fill critical workforce needs in Indiana.

Indiana is entering a new era of dynamic growth led by the biosciences, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and hospitality industries. Just last year, Indiana's biosciences sector generated over $99 billion in economic activity, while its hospitality industry welcomed 30 million visitors who contributed $5.8 billion of economic impact. Increased demand presents opportunities to innovate, and Indiana University is rising to the occasion to help Indianapolis and the state thrive.

By creating new ways to ensure that students graduate with relevant experience, developing cooperative initiatives that strengthen key sectors and delivering research-backed solutions to issues affecting our region, IU is responding to the state's needs in real time and helping define its future.

Where academia meets industry

IU is reimagining how higher education can serve a state's business environment by helping boost existing businesses and creating and attracting new ones.

The IU Launch Accelerator for Biosciences is the front door for industry. Supported by a $138 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc., this first-of-its-kind academic-industry initiative is elevating the state as a national biosciences hub. In collaboration with leading central Indiana bioscience organizations - like Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, BioCrossroads and IU Health - its goal is to find new discoveries and commercialize therapeutics and products that improve Hoosiers' health while creating jobs and driving investment in the state.

""IU LAB will unlock the potential of human health innovation by connecting ideas, talent and technology across disciplines and sectors,"" IU LAB President and CEO David Rosenberg said. ""It will do more than advance research; it will drive advancements and commercialization in biosciences that will ultimately shape the future of care, industry and Indiana through collaboration.""

IU LAB is already drawing in new companies. For example, the IU Health Incubator at IU LAB will assist up to 40 human health biosciences startups per year and help them grow into major companies. In July, the incubator's pre-accelerator in partnership with gener8tor launched a seven-week program where founders received tailored training to refine their businesses models and learn to raise capital.

Last month, IU LAB's LifeTech Accelerator launched in partnership with Plug and Play, BioCrossroads and IU Health. This 14-week intensive program will connect up to 30 startups to mentors, workshops, pitch sessions and corporate partners to accelerate their growth.

IU LAB also works to bring IU research to market. In tandem with the Convergent Bioscience and Technology Institute, the Institute for Human Health and Wellbeing, and the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute at IU Indianapolis, it's leveraging faculty research to patent lifechanging technologies.

The Joint Center of Excellence for Point of Care Precision Medicine, a center co-created by IU and the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, will be housed at IU LAB. The center seeks to transform healthcare outcomes by taking an interdisciplinary approach to discovering and developing new therapies, diagnostics and manufacturing processes, as well as become a genesis for startup ventures to grow.

""IU LAB is a powerful catalyst for Indiana's biosciences sector,"" said Vince Wong, president and CEO of BioCrossroads. ""By connecting promising startups with the resources and partnerships they need to develop and scale, IU LAB is helping unlock Indiana's full potential as a life sciences leader.""

Breaking barriers to innovation

IU's strategic partnerships help researchers seamlessly translate their discoveries - accelerating breakthroughs and strengthening Indiana's innovation ecosystem.

A Master Collaboration Agreement between the university and one of the state's largest medical device companies, Cook Medical, is making it easier to propel innovation, removing administrative barriers that can prevent ideas from flowing back and forth.

This all-services model includes research and development, research services, technical certifications, credentialing, workforce training and development, and technical consulting.

Researchers at IU already collaborate with Cook on cutting-edge technology. The Fibers and Additive Manufacturing Enabled Systems, or FAMES Lab, at the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering worked with Cook to develop microscopically thin sensors that would revolutionize how surgeons operate.

Another IU-led initiative is bringing together the state's academic leadership with industry expertise to strengthen central and northern Indiana's musculoskeletal health impact.

The Indiana Musculoskeletal Health Partnership for the Advancement of Care & Treatment is a statewide, IU-led consortium with more than 100 partners, including Eli Lilly, Zimmer Biomet, BioCrossroads, OrthoWorx, IU Health and the Regenstrief Institute. The consortium aims to bridge the gap between unmet orthopedic health needs and the technologies - like implants and wearable diagnostics - that can solve them.

Preparing Indiana's best and brightest

When it comes to talent development, IU is a driving force for businesses across central Indiana and the entire state.

At IU Indianapolis, where 90% of graduates remain in Indiana to build their careers, co-op partnerships across sectors equip students with authentic workforce experience, while creating talent pipelines to the state's top employers in biomedical, business and hospitality industries.

Students interested in careers in finance, human resources or information technology can develop their skills through a co-op at Eli Lilly and Company. White Lodging, a hospitality company that operates the JW Marriott and four other hotels in the city, established a co-op for students studying tourism, event and sport management, preparing them for careers in Indianapolis' bustling hospitality industry after graduation. The Kelley School of Business connects students to real-world job experiences at Elanco through its Kelley Indianapolis Business Plus program.

At a press conference, longtime farmer and rural advocate Kent Yeager said rising production costs have completely changed the way farmers run their operations.

“Inputs are so expensive anymore,” Yeager said. “It’s changed dramatically over the last 25 or 30 years in how much it costs to raise a crop. It makes it really easy for that number to be negative if we don’t have good prices, and those prices are affected by a lot of things we can’t control.”

Yeager said the lack of clear market and government data, combined with the ongoing federal government shutdown, makes it even harder for farmers to plan for the next growing season.

Farmer Andrew Stewart echoed those concerns, noting that uncertainty in fertilizer supplies and energy costs has hit producers hard.

“We’ve been trying to look at alternatives. Chicken litter and other organic fertilizers are getting more popular, but with bird flu, you never know how many chickens will be out there to produce the manure,” Stewart said. “Then there’s the cost of transportation and application. If we can control our inputs a little bit, that helps, but everything is connected.”

He added that environmental and industrial shifts are unintentionally raising costs. “All our diesel engines now require DEF, which is made from urea, and that’s raised the cost of urea for fertilizer,” Stewart said. “Now we’re seeing phosphorus being used for electric car batteries, and down the road that could raise fertilizer costs too.”

Cattle producer Tim Schwab said trade policy and consumer education are equally important to the future of Hoosier agriculture.

“We need to educate consumers, not just about beef, but about all the products coming off the farm,” Schwab said. “Trade policies need to be market-driven and science-based. We raise the highest-quality soybeans and beef. If we let the markets work and base our policies on science, we’ll be a lot better off.”

Despite the current federal shutdown, the 36th in U.S. history, Stewart said most farmers are determined to keep working.

“Farmers are resilient,” he said. “We’re going to keep producing whether the government is open or not. There are things we have to put off, but we’re still trying to produce the highest-quality corn and soybeans we can.”

Still, the shutdown has disrupted key services. Yeager noted that some Farm Service Agency offices are closed and market reporting has stopped for crops and livestock. “Thankfully, meat inspectors are considered essential,” he said. “So processing plants are still operating.”

Schwab also spoke about the toll of the avian flu outbreak, which continues to affect poultry and egg producers nationwide.

“When we have to depopulate because of something like that, the stress is unreal,” Schwab said. “We care about our animals, and it takes a human toll.

Developed in collaboration with governments, employers, and industry stakeholders, the standard provides a clear and consistent way for the workforce to build a strong knowledge and understanding of sustainability.

Meeting a global challenge

Every nation is navigating its own path to lower carbon emissions. Yet the global ambition remains the same: to reduce carbon emissions and move towards cleaner energy solutions.

“Around the world, countries are at different stages of their energy transition journey,” explains Ewen Hay, OPITO’s Director of Products and Services. “But the shared aspiration is clear. As a result, there’s a global desire to educate and inform the workforce about alternative energy solutions in a consistent way.”

OPITO’s new Sustainability Training Standard gives employers across safety-critical industries a practical, flexible route to prepare their people for the present and future demands of the energy transition.

Building sustainability expertise across the workforce

Designed for learners at all stages – from early careers to experienced professionals – OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard is open to all, with no entry requirements.

The standard’s learning outcomes cover a comprehensive range of sustainability topics. Learners explore:

The global context for sustainability and climate change

The rationale for reducing carbon emissions

Key alternative energy sources, including hydrogen, wind, solar, and carbon capture and storage (CCS)

Local and global policies driving the transition to net-zero emissions

Participants learn how sustainability principles apply within industry and wider business settings. They also understand the contribution different energy sources make to both national and international carbon reduction goals.

“All learners who complete this training will have a greater understanding of sustainability in a global business context,” says Hay. “The standard provides participants with a really comprehensive understanding of alternative energy sources, the future energy mix, and aspirations of local governments to meet climate change targets.”

Global consistency, local relevance

OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard offers employers consistent sustainability education for global teams while tailoring the learning experience to reflect local contexts. The standard combines international best practices with local strategies to make learning both globally consistent and regionally relevant.

For Hay, this balance is essential. “The standard is a trusted, globally relevant source of information that can also be contextualised to fit regional differences,” he explains. “Employers can be confident that their people are learning from an industry-recognized standard, with scope to reflect regional carbon reduction aspirations.

Developed in close collaboration with industry

Like all its products, OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard was developed through close collaboration with industry stakeholders, and with governments and employers around the world.

This partnership-led approach underpins OPITO’s wider mission to support safety-critical industries through high-quality, globally-recognized training frameworks.

While the Sustainability Training Standard is a standalone product in its own right, it can complement some of OPITO’s other offerings – like its Introduction to Energy qualifications – for learners who wish to explore energy industry topics in more detail.

Preparing the workforce for the future

For employers, the energy transition brings both challenge and opportunity. The workforce must evolve in step with industry changes as new technologies and energy sources emerge.

“Now is the time for employers to train their workforce and get them ready for the changes ahead,” says Hay. “OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard provides a valuable vehicle for organizations to give their people the knowledge they’ll need to work confidently across the future energy mix.”

Empowering learners for the energy transition

The launch of the Sustainability Training Standard reinforces OPITO’s commitment to supporting an industry in transition. As the global energy mix continues to diversify, OPITO remains focused on developing new, relevant solutions that reflect emerging technologies and changing workforce demands.

“We’re firmly focused on meeting the needs of employers and learners as the energy sector evolves,” Hay concludes. “This is just one step in OPITO’s ongoing journey to equip the global workforce with the skills and knowledge they need to play their part in shaping the future.”

Lead in soil, left by lead-based paint, can cause neurological damage, especially in children, for example. Meanwhile, contaminants called PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and dubbed “forever chemicals” for their high persistence, are linked to cancer, problems with the immune response and in pregnancy, among other issues.

Zhiming Zhang, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, devises methods for removing these and other substances from soil and water.

When picked up and transported by stormwater, PFAS can enter drinking water sources. In studies of New Jersey stormwater runoff, he and colleagues identified multiple PFAS compounds, among which the concentrations of PFOA and PFOS exceeded many times over the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s four parts-per-trillion maximum contaminant level for drinking water. Meanwhile, his group is testing ways to remove these contaminants, including breaking them down with bacteria or specialized oxidation treatments. They are also experimenting with filtering PFAS out of water by, for example, binding them onto materials leftover from the treatment of drinking water, which would otherwise go to a landfill..

Separately, his group is extracting lead from soil with vetiver grass along with the use of biodegradable agents that aid this process. Over three years, this method cut the lead in a community garden plot in Jersey City down to about one-fourth its original concentration. After completing a remediation project like this one, they recycled the plants’ lead-containing roots by turning them into a type of charcoal known as biochar that then can be used to filter contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) from wastewater. The leaves, which uptake very little lead, are used to make bioethanol, a type of fuel. The use of the entire vetiver plant after soil lead extraction aims to form a circular economy model.

“We try to minimize waste and make the most use of the resources we have during the environmental protection process” Zhang says.

""There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,"" Isaac said.","The Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder.

The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.

Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.

The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.

Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.

""There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,"" Isaac said. ""Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.""

Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.

""We're going to keep all options on the table,"" Isaac said. ""This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.""

The government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.

The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from ""other jurisdictions"" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.

""We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,"" the executive said.

Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.

But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.

The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.

Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.

But there are still industries that release waste into the air and water.","One of the highest-risk components of nuclear waste is iodine-129 (I-129), which stays radioactive for millions of years and accumulates in human thyroids when ingested. In the U.S., nuclear waste containing I-129 is scheduled to be disposed of in deep underground repositories, which scientists say will sufficiently isolate it.

Meanwhile, across the globe, France routinely releases low-level radioactive effluents containing iodine-129 and other radionuclides into the ocean. France recycles its spent nuclear fuel, and the reprocessing plant discharges about 153 kilograms of iodine-129 each year, under the French regulatory limit.

Is dilution a good solution? What’s the best way to handle spent nuclear fuel? A new study by MIT researchers and their collaborators at national laboratories quantifies I-129 release under three different scenarios: the U.S. approach of disposing spent fuel directly in deep underground repositories, the French approach of dilution and release, and an approach that uses filters to capture I-129 and disposes of them in shallow underground waste repositories.

The researchers found France’s current practice of reprocessing releases about 90 percent of the waste’s I-129 into the biosphere. They found low levels of I-129 in ocean water around France and the U.K.’s former reprocessing sites, including the English Channel and North Sea. Although the low level of I-129 in the water in Europe is not considered to pose health risks, the U.S. approach of deep underground disposal leads to far less I-129 being released, the researchers found.

The researchers also investigated the effect of environmental regulations and technologies related to I-129 management, to illuminate the tradeoffs associated with different approaches around the world.

“Putting these pieces together to provide a comprehensive view of Iodine-129 is important,” says MIT Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, a first author on the paper who holds a joint appointment in the departments of Nuclear Science and Engineering and of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “There are scientists that spend their lives trying to clean up iodine-129 at contaminated sites. These scientists are sometimes shocked to learn some countries are releasing so much iodine-129. This work also provides a life-cycle perspective. We’re not just looking at final disposal and solid waste, but also when and where release is happening. It puts all the pieces together.”

MIT graduate student Kate Whiteaker SM ’24 led many of the analyses with Wainwright. Their co-authors are Hansell Gonzalez-Raymat, Miles Denham, Ian Pegg, Daniel Kaplan, Nikolla Qafoku, David Wilson, Shelly Wilson, and Carol Eddy-Dilek. The study appears today in Nature Sustainability.

Managing waste

Iodine-129 is often a key focus for scientists and engineers as they conduct safety assessments of nuclear waste disposal sites around the world. It has a half-life of 15.7 million years, high environmental mobility, and could potentially cause cancers if ingested. The U.S. sets a strict limit on how much I-129 can be released and how much I-129 can be in drinking water — 5.66 nanograms per liter, the lowest such level of any radionuclides.

“Iodine-129 is very mobile, so it is usually the highest-dose contributor in safety assessments,” Wainwright says.

For the study, the researchers calculated the release of I-129 across three different waste management strategies by combining data from current and former reprocessing sites as well as repository assessment models and simulations.

The authors defined the environmental impact as the release of I-129 into the biosphere that humans could be exposed to, as well as its concentrations in surface water. They measured I-129 release per the total electrical energy generated by a 1-gigawatt power plant over one year, denoted as kg/GWe.y.

Under the U.S. approach of deep underground disposal with barrier systems, assuming the barrier canisters fail at 1,000 years (a conservative estimate), the researchers found 2.14 x 10–8 kg/GWe.y of I-129 would be released between 1,000 and 1 million years from today.

They estimate that 4.51 kg/GWe.y of I-129, or 91 percent of the total, would be released into the biosphere in the scenario where fuel is reprocessed and the effluents are diluted and released. About 3.3 percent of I-129 is captured by gas filters, which are then disposed of in shallow subsurfaces as low-level radioactive waste. A further 5.2 percent remains in the waste stream of the reprocessing plant, which is then disposed of as high-level radioactive waste.

If the waste is recycled with gas filters to directly capture I-129, 0.05 kg/GWe.y of the I-129 is released, while 94 percent is disposed of in the low-level disposal sites. For shallow disposal, some kind of human disruption and intrusion is assumed to occur after government or institutional control expires (typically 100-1,000 years). That results in a potential release of the disposed amount to the environment after the control period.

Overall, the current practice of recycling spent nuclear fuel releases the majority of I-129 into the environment today, while the direct disposal of spent fuel releases around 1/100,000,000 that amount over 1 million years. When the gas filters are used to capture I-129, the majority of I-129 goes to shallow underground repositories, which could be accidentally released through human intrusion down the line.

The researchers also quantified the concentration of I-129 in different surface waters near current and former fuel reprocessing facilities, including the English Channel and the North Sea near reprocessing plants in France and U.K. They also analyzed the U.S. Columbia River downstream of a site in Washington state where material for nuclear weapons was produced during the Cold War, and they studied a similar site in South Carolina. The researchers found far higher concentrations of I-129 within the South Carolina site, where the low-level radioactive effluents were released far from major rivers and hence resulted in less dilution in the environment.

“We wanted to quantify the environmental factors and the impact of dilution, which in this case affected concentrations more than discharge amounts,” Wainwright says. “Someone might take our results to say dilution still works: It’s reducing the contaminant concentration and spreading it over a large area. On the other hand, in the U.S., imperfect disposal has led to locally higher surface water concentrations. This provides a cautionary tale that disposal could concentrate contaminants, and should be carefully designed to protect local communities.”

Fuel cycles and policy

Wainwright doesn’t want her findings to dissuade countries from recycling nuclear fuel. She says countries like Japan plan to use increased filtration to capture I-129 when they reprocess spent fuel. Filters with I-129 can be disposed of as low-level waste under U.S. regulations.

“Since I-129 is an internal carcinogen without strong penetrating radiation, shallow underground disposal would be appropriate in line with other hazardous waste,” Wainwright says. “The history of environmental protection since the 1960s is shifting from waste dumping and release to isolation. But there are still industries that release waste into the air and water. We have seen that they often end up causing issues in our daily life — such as CO2, mercury, PFAS and others — especially when there are many sources or when bioaccumulation happens. The nuclear community has been leading in waste isolation strategies and technologies since the 1950s. These efforts should be further enhanced and accelerated. But at the same time, if someone does not choose nuclear energy because of waste issues, it would encourage other industries with much lower environmental standards.”

The work was supported by MIT’s Climate Fast Forward Faculty Fund and the U.S. Department of Energy.

The government closure dragged into its 36th day Wednesday, shattering the record set during the last Trump administration for the longest shutdown ever. And there’s little indication this one will end anytime soon.

Federal workers across the government are furloughed, missing paychecks and unsure whether they’ll get back pay after White House suggestions that it’s not a sure thing.

The impacts of the shutdown have been uneven across the government — including at energy and environmental agencies — as the administration has found cash to keep some programs funded and officials have prioritized some favored projects over others. Some energy and environmental work has stopped entirely, while other projects are expected to grind to a halt as funding dries up.

Meanwhile, Democrats’ big wins in off-year elections Tuesday could shift the political calculus as the stalemate continues. Congressional Democratic leaders, emboldened by Tuesday’s results, kicked off the day Wednesday with their latest demand for a bipartisan meeting with President Donald Trump to talk about the shutdown.

Here’s what the longest shutdown looks like at energy and environmental agencies on day 36:

Interior Department

Despite roughly 29,000 Interior Department employees on furlough since Oct. 1, the department has barreled ahead with Trump priorities, including energy development.

That has included reopening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and issuing more than 600 drilling permits across public lands.

But elsewhere the shutdown has frozen normal business. Interior has missed court appearances and is losing an estimated $1 million a day in revenue that national parks usually collect during the busy fall season.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum sent an email Friday commiserating with the department’s furloughed staff.

“Whether you serve in the field, in regional offices, or here in Washington, your absence is felt,” he wrote.

The note comes on the heels of Burgum making several statements to the media characterizing the shutdown as an opportunity for the Trump administration to cut costs. Burgum was planning to lay off more than 2,000 department employees, but that agenda was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Department officials said Tuesday they will no longer pursue layoffs during the shutdown.

Some critics have taken Burgum to task for advancing energy projects and visiting an oil summit in the United Arab Emirates and an energy gathering in Bahrain during the lapse in federal funds.

“Approving more than 600 drilling permits and dozens of new leases while parks operate with skeleton crews shows this shutdown is being used to benefit oil and gas executives at the expense of our public lands,” Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement.

Bureau of Land Management

Interior’s Bureau of Land Management has continued to work on big-ticket items, such as a suite of policy directives opening hundreds of thousands of acres in Alaska to drilling, as well as smaller-scale moves like planned oil and gas lease sales, timber harvests, and mining permits.

Burgum announced last month that he was signing an order to reopen the coastal plain of ANWR to drilling, reversing the Biden administration’s halt on development.

He also announced that the agency is advancing construction of the 211-mile-long Ambler mining road to provide access to a remote mining district in northwestern Alaska.

Mining of critical minerals has remained a priority during the shutdown, and the bureau Monday approved the expansion of a barite ore mine in northeastern Nevada. In that case, the bureau used a streamlined permitting process, following the president’s call to shorten environmental reviews of simpler projects to 14 days.

BLM also announced this week it would hold an oil and gas lease sale in January involving parcels in Montana and North Dakota. That lease sale is now open for a 30-day public protest period.

Fish and Wildlife Service

While oil, gas and mineral permitting barrels forward, agencies including the Fish and Wildlife Service have missed court-set or statutory deadlines for action.

Environmental groups, for instance, have been pressing the Trump administration on allegations that officials ignored the National Environmental Policy Act when the state of Florida constructed an immigrant detention facility near the Everglades National Park.

Citing the shutdown, government attorneys convinced the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to extend an important brief-filing deadline originally set for late October.

“The Department of Justice does not know when such funding will be restored by Congress,” DOJ attorneys advised the appellate court.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, too, has missed various deadlines set under legal settlements, including a decision whether to list the Bornean earless monitor as threatened or endangered and finalizing critical habitat for the endangered rusty patched bumble bee.

“The agency is starved of the money and staff needed to meet those deadlines,” said Jake Li, a former FWS official who is now vice president of conservation policy at Defenders of Wildlife. “Long before the shutdown, FWS struggled with this problem daily, and now it’s amplified multifold.”

National parks

The National Park Service has attracted significant public attention amid the shutdown, with more than 9,000 park staffers furloughed. The Trump administration ordered parks to remain mostly accessible to the public, tapping recreation fees to pay skeleton crews for cleaning. Those crews haven’t stopped some illegal activity spiking in parks, such as parachuters in Yosemite.

Some conservation groups, worried about damage to facilities, urged visitors to stay home during the peak fall foliage that drives the highest visitation days of the year for some parks.

Private groups and local governments have secured funds to pay national park staff in some cases, as a stopgap until the government reopens. West Virginia secured cash to keep Harpers Ferry National Historical Park and the New River George National Park and Preserve open. Similar efforts supported Muir Woods National Monument in California and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. States have helped pay for parks in previous shutdowns as well, but those arrangements have sometimes sparked discord over whether states should be repaid.

Parks without outside funding have been burning through their fee funds to keep facilities partially staffed. As long as the shutdown lasts, the agency is also losing new revenue to replace that money, because parks can’t collect fees during the shutdown. They are bleeding roughly $1 million per day from uncollected entrance and recreation fees, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.

EPA

EPA has managed to stay open during the shutdown, but its operations are slowly grinding to a halt.

Tapping carryover funds, the agency has adopted an unusual “phased” approach to furloughs. Consequently, employees working on Trump administration priorities, such as drafting rule rollbacks and approving permits, remain on the job while others have been sent home.

That has spiked anxiety among staffers who don’t know if they will receive a paycheck or furlough notice during the funding lapse, according to EPA employees granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

One agency staffer said managers have been unable to answer questions about who will be sent home and when. “Headquarters is basically flying by the seat of their pants, but we all knew that already,” they said.

On the eve of this shutdown, essentially all staffers received an unsigned email to report to work for the time being. Furloughs, however, have now spread across the agency through its program offices and regional branches.

American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, EPA’s largest union, conducted an internal survey of EPA employees two weeks ago, and 60 percent of roughly 1,000 respondents said they were furloughed. In turn, the union estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 EPA employees have been sent home during the shutdown.

Administrator Lee Zeldin has said EPA’s biggest wave of furloughs came last month, capturing 4,000 employees. He has warned that another round is coming as the shutdown lingers.

“A total lapse of funding is an 89 percent reduction of our agency, which means that a lot of the president’s priorities, the American public’s priorities, wouldn’t be able to be met,” Zeldin said in a Fox News interview over this past weekend.

The administrator was referring to the agency’s shutdown plan, which would furlough more than 13,000 EPA employees once carryover funds run out.

EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement the agency has been “intentional and aggressive” focusing on statutory obligations and presidential priorities during the shutdown. EPA’s statement didn’t address questions about how many employees have been furloughed and when carryover funds will expire.

Slowed operations

Parts of the agency’s operations have been stalled as spending starts to run thin. The publication of proposed and final rules in the Federal Register — a key step in allowing for public feedback and ensuring that new regulations take hold — has slowed to a trickle.

More than a month ago, for example, EPA dropped a bid to give the coke industry more time to meet hazardous air pollutant regulations strengthened last year during President Joe Biden’s tenure. But because the decision to reinstate the original compliance timetable has yet to appear in the Register, it has not taken effect.

EPA press aides acknowledged receipt of a Tuesday email but did not reply to questions regarding the publication delay.

The shutdown is also slowing proceedings in Clean Air Act lawsuits. Except for “very limited circumstances,” Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, according to a filing early last month in legal challenges to another Biden administration regulation that tightened the annual soot exposure standard.

A federal appeals court agreed to DOJ’s request to postpone an upcoming deadline until funding is restored.

Water, chemical safety work

In EPA’s Office of Water, the shutdown has halted the distribution of grants to states, water utilities and local governments. The situation comes as EPA is months behind in allocating funding this year to states to remove and replace lead pipes under the state revolving funds.

EPA has also stopped approving new water quality standards and water pollution cleanup plans for specific bodies of water, per its shutdown plan. But the water office has continued to work on certain Trump administration priorities, having held a webinar on Oct. 14 about EPA’s plans to give coal companies more time to comply with a major water pollution rule.

It’s not clear how widespread the impacts have been when it comes to water-related permits, according to some observers.

“We have not heard of any issues yet. I think this is because of the carryover funding the agency was using,” Julia Anastasio, executive director of the Association of Clean Water Administrators, an association for state officials charged with protecting surface waters, said in an email.

“We know that several regional offices and parts of [the water office] were operating on carryover funds and that those funds are starting to run out,” Anastasio added.

Meanwhile, staffers who work on new chemical reviews and pesticide registrations have been churning out approvals, as evidenced by documents published in the Federal Register this week. But employees in that same office who work on pollution prevention programs — roughly 30 percent of the office’s workforce — have been furloughed.

The shutdown has added to the often lengthy wait times for EPA to process records requests under the Freedom of Information Act, with the agency citing “unusual circumstances” in noting that FOIA office employees may be furloughed.

Meanwhile, waste from industrial facilities has gone unchecked as meetings with polluters have been canceled, according to a third EPA employee who has been sent home. They recently stopped by one of the sites they had been monitoring.

“I watched the stack spew stuff into the air for a little bit before driving on,” said the staffer.

Energy Department

At the Energy Department, the shutdown has dealt the biggest blow to hundreds of staffers in the office that oversees the nation’s nuclear weapons.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright late last month said the agency was finding “creative ways” to pay contractors at the National Nuclear Security Administration through the end of October. Wright’s comments arrived on the heels of the department furloughing 1,400 employees in the division. About 375 staffers are being exempted and will remain on the job at NNSA.

DOE later clarified that it had tapped money for contractors from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July.

Ben Dietderich, a spokesperson for DOE, said in a statement that NNSA contractors across the agency have enough funding to work through the end of November and that the agency is continuing to safeguard the nation’s nuclear deterrent.

“Due to the Democrat shutdown, a portion of the [NNSA] federal support contracts lapsed on October 31st. These contractors, which account for less than six percent of the NNSA’s contracts, primarily serve administrative roles,” said Dietderich. “Our contractors across NNSA’s labs, plants, and sites have funding through the end of the month. DOE/NNSA continues to safeguard our nation’s nuclear deterrent.”

Staffers throughout other parts of the agency say they’re girding for possible furloughs, but that hinges on how much funding their individual offices have left to continue operating.

They are also eyeing possible layoffs.

DOE last month notified staffers in at least six offices, including those focused on solar, wind and hydrogen, that they could be reassigned, fired or transferred.

The agency also accused those divisions of “wasteful spending” and “regulatory overreach” under the Biden administration, even though many of the offices don’t write regulations and are focused on research, and small-scale testing and demonstration of new technologies.

One DOE staffer said they’ve received no information “since those letters went out something like three weeks ago.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/67/29/a2feec7c44ad9efba65bb938fa21/u-s-congress-12899.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:19:30.435407

Participants in nonunion GRAPs increased by 40.7% from FY 2019 to FY 2024, compared to 10.7% for union programs.
Completers of nonunion GRAPs increased by 31.7% from FY 2019 to FY 2024, compared to 13.4% for union programs.","On Nov. 5, ABC sent a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions ahead of its Nov. 6 hearing, “Registered Apprenticeship: Scaling the Workforce for the Future.”

In the letter, ABC thanked the committee for examining how apprenticeship and workforce development programs can help meet the nation’s growing demand for skilled construction workers. “Registered apprenticeships are one important part of a diverse workforce development ecosystem,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs. “But rigid structures and lengthy completion times discourage participation by employers and workers alike. Congress should modernize and expand the system to support all high-quality training models that successfully prepare Americans for rewarding construction careers.”

ABC’s 67 chapters educate craft, safety and management professionals using innovative and flexible learning models, such as just-in-time task training, competency-based progression and work-based learning. These talent development initiatives occur alongside ABC’s more than 450 federal and state government-registered apprenticeship programs, or GRAPs, that prepare American’s nationwide for safe and productive work in more than 20 occupations. Further, ABC members invested an estimated $1.6 billion in construction industry workforce development to upskill 1.3 million course attendees in 2023, including hundreds of GRAPs, independently administered by ABC member companies.

However, it is clear that, at current rates of participation and completion, federal and state GRAPs still fail to meet the construction industry’s short- and long-term skilled workforce development needs. According to an annual ABC analysis of U.S. Department of Labor data, ABC estimates that, in fiscal year 2024, 290,000 apprentices were enrolled in federal and state GRAPs that yielded less than 40,000 completers—well short of the 439,000 workers needed in 2025 alone.

ABC and its members’ investment in GRAPs is reflected by DOL data displaying significant growth in nonunion GRAPs between FY 2015 and FY 2024.

The DOL’s data presents five-year trend lines indicating stronger proportional growth in the number of nonunion GRAPs, apprentice participants and apprentice completers compared to union-affiliated GRAPs since FY 2019.

In FY 2024, 84% of the construction industry’s GRAPs were nonunion providers. The number of nonunion GRAPs has grown by 25% since FY 2019, compared to a 7% decrease in union-affiliated GRAPs since FY 2019.

Participants in nonunion GRAPs increased by 40.7% from FY 2019 to FY 2024, compared to 10.7% for union programs.

Completers of nonunion GRAPs increased by 31.7% from FY 2019 to FY 2024, compared to 13.4% for union programs.

In FY 2024, 29.74% of all construction industry GRAP participants were in nonunion programs.

Further, while construction unions represent just 10.3% of the U.S. construction workforce, they continue to operate a majority of the nation’s registered apprenticeship programs, accounting for roughly 69% of participants.",,N,,2025-11-05 14:06:19.137643

Since joining the Moore administration, Pinsky has been an integral part of the state’s efforts to expand its clean energy portfolio.
Miller, Pinsky recalled, threatened to spend $100,000 to defeat him.
In the Senate, Pinsky focused mostly on education, the environment, and political reform, notching some victories and some defeats.
Shortly after Moore was elected governor in 2022, he turned to Pinsky to head the Maryland Energy Administration.","Paul Pinsky, who went from a back bencher in the General Assembly, out of step ideologically with most of his colleagues, to a major architect of consequential legislation, and who now is a key member of Gov. Wes Moore’s administration, will end his 39 years of state service later this month.

Pinsky, 75, informed his staff Wednesday morning that he is stepping down as director of the Maryland Energy Administration, a job he has held since 2023 after three dozen years in the legislature.

In an interview, Pinsky noted that most of his contemporaries have retired from full-time work – and said there’s much he wants to do in the years ahead beyond serving in public office.

“I’m the last person standing,” he said. “I do this with mixed emotions. I’m still having fun. I think I’m a good leader. But I don’t want to drop dead in a year without being able to do X, Y and Z.”

Even at the start of his political career, Pinsky called himself a progressive, when few Maryland Democrats would, only to see the party move gradually in his direction. In the years ahead he hopes to impart wisdom he’s gained from his experiences as a liberal leader in a state whose political establishment is centrist and often resistant to change.

“I want to do some writing about the lessons I’ve learned over the years, particularly for younger activists who want to run for state or local offices,” he said.

Pinsky has at times been called “the Bernie Sanders of Maryland,” and their careers have dovetailed to an extent. Pinsky said that, like Sanders, his “mantra” has been “putting people’s needs ahead of corporate greed.”

Drawing on his skills as a longtime political organizer, Pinsky has co-authored some of the most significant legislation in recent Maryland history, including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan and the Climate Solutions Now law that sets aggressive climate mandates for the state. Since joining the Moore administration, Pinsky has been an integral part of the state’s efforts to expand its clean energy portfolio.

But he was a political outlier when he was elected in 1986 to represent Prince George’s County’s District 22 in the House of Delegates, far to the left of his Democratic colleagues and party leaders. He teamed up with a fellow freshman, Brian Frosh (D-Montgomery), who went on to become state attorney general, and later with another young lawmaker, Chris Van Hollen (D-Montgomery), now Maryland’s senior U.S. senator, to form a liberal “Three Musketeers” in the legislature.

They were often at odds with the House speaker, Clay Mitchell, a conservative Democrat from the Eastern Shore. Pinsky shakes his head thinking about those days, recalling being on the losing end of several 131-10 votes.

The longtime state Senate president, Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D), a fellow Prince Georgian, sought unsuccessfully to keep Pinsky from moving up to the Senate in 1994. But Pinsky persevered, advancing slowly but surely into Senate leadership – and in 2019, Miller would hand Pinsky the gavel to the powerful Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee.

Miller, who died in 2021, eventually found his colleague to be frank and reliable – one of the most dependable members of the Senate.

“He’s come a long way,” Miller said in a 2019 interview. “We still disagree on a lot of personal views, but I trust him implicitly. He’s an honest man.”

Pinsky grew up in the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia and came to Washington, D.C., in 1968 to attend George Washington University. At GW, he participated in multiple student protests, falling in with a crowd of left-wing activists who became lifelong friends.

From 1976 to 1995, Pinsky was a history teacher for the Prince George’s County Public Schools – and learned the vagaries of local politics by spending four years as president of the county teachers’ union. While teaching and coaching basketball at Fairmont Heights High School, Pinsky met his future wife, Joan Rothgeb, a fellow teacher who later became an administrator in the school district – and was also a scholastic basketball coach. Pinsky later became an organizer with the Montgomery County teachers’ union.

By his own account, Pinsky often found himself on the fringes of the political debate in his early years in Annapolis, focusing on things like predatory corporate practices and whether Maryland National Guard troops should be deployed to war-torn Central America.

In 1990, after Sanders, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, was elected to Congress, Pinsky was one of a handful of Washington, D.C.-area progressives asked to organize a “Welcome to D.C.” event for Sanders. It drew 800 supporters to Eastern Market, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and current and former members of Congress. Years later, in 2016, Pinsky was an elected delegate for Sanders’ presidential campaign at the Democratic National Convention.

In 1994, Pinsky prepared to challenge his district’s incumbent senator, Thomas P. O’Reilly, the chair of the Finance Committee, in the Democratic primary. Miller, Pinsky recalled, threatened to spend $100,000 to defeat him.

At a bullroast for U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) that year, Pinsky confronted Miller, who had asked him how he was doing.

“I’d be better, Mike,” Pinsky replied, “if you’d stay the hell out of my race.”

Miller eventually backed off; O’Reilly wound up resigning before the end of his term to join the State Workers Compensation Commission, and Pinsky was appointed to replace him. He won a full term that fall – and Van Hollen and Frosh joined him in moving up to the Senate.

In their first Senate term, the three lawmakers and several of their colleagues sought to derail a deal to bring two professional football stadiums to Maryland – Pinsky arguing at the time that taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize “pleasure palaces for plutocrats.”

They fell short, but the vote was by no means a sure thing, and Pinsky said he quickly saw the advantages of being in the Senate.

“The Senate is much more fun, when you’re one of 47 [members], when they need 24 votes to pass things,” he observed. “It’s harder for you to be marginalized.”

Pinsky, Van Hollen and Frosh remain good friends, and at the time, Pinsky said, he felt exhilarated being able to collaborate with them. “It made it easier and more fun to strategize.” Van Hollen has called Pinsky “a kindred spirit.”

Pinsky said the smaller size of the chamber also enabled him to forge personal relationships with colleagues he wasn’t in sync with ideologically – including Miller.

In the Senate, Pinsky focused mostly on education, the environment, and political reform, notching some victories and some defeats. When Miller made Frosh, the Senate’s leading environmentalist, chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee in 2003, Pinsky knew he had to pick up the mantle.

“I was like, what?” Pinsky recalled. “You’re it. It was a weight on me, frankly. I felt a duty, an obligation to do more on the environment.”

In 2006, he authored the Healthy Air Act, which imposed strict emissions controls on Maryland power plants and paved the way for the state to join the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which sells carbon credits to polluters. The revenues are largely used to fund clean energy.

Pinsky also passed a bill making it easier for Maryland teachers to receive national board certification.

He gained clout over the years through his seniority, at the same time his relationship with Miller grew closer. Pinsky said he and Miller would run into each other at University of Maryland basketball games, and would make time to chat. Pinsky’s wife was diagnosed with cancer several years ago (she died in 2020, at the age of 63); Miller’s cancer diagnosis also created a bond between them.

“Over the years, Mike softened, I softened,” Pinsky reflected. “You came together. With Mike, you always knew where you stood.”

In 2015, Miller appointed Pinsky vice chair of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, which had a broad portfolio, and four years later, after the committee chair, Sen. Joan Carter Conway (D-Baltimore City), lost her reelection bid, he handed Pinsky the gavel.

The committee did a lot of heavy lifting during Pinsky’s tenure, passing the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which Pinsky had spent years crafting with fellow lawmakers, educators, business and civic leaders, and developing the state’s principal climate law.

Pinsky in his final years in the legislature also passed a measure making community college free for most Marylanders, expanded Miller’s Chesapeake Bay Conservation Corps to become a climate corps, and shepherded through a bill requiring Maryland to plant 5 million new trees. He also led the legislative effort to roll back then-Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) edict that all school systems should delay the opening of the school year until after Labor Day – creating controversy by comparing Hogan to Southern state governors in the 1950s and ‘60s who stood in the doorways of schools to prevent Black students from entering.

Pinsky said there was no single “Aha!” moment that made him think he had arrived as a serious policymaker after years as a bombthrower.

“It was a gradual transition,” he said, adding, “I never not wanted to be a bombthrower. I always wanted to put people ahead of corporate interests.”

But Pinsky marveled thinking about a time, when he was the committee chair, that a highly-compensated utility executive sat in his office, pressing his case for an initiative that Pinsky opposed.

“I thought to myself, what are you doing here?” he recalled. “How did I get here?”

Pinsky credited the activists he worked with on several issues to help him achieve his legislative successes. “Half my time is spent mobilizing with the base, because they’re going to make my life easy,” he said.

But Pinsky can still tally his legislative losses. He tried for years to bring “combined reporting” to Maryland – where related corporations are treated as single entities for tax purposes, a provision more than 20 other states have. Pinsky remains frustrated that lawmakers have been so reluctant to embrace this reform, which would provide substantial additional revenues.

Pinsky unsuccessfully fought legislation that gives gas companies subsidies from ratepayers to build infrastructure. His bills to ban candy and soda and corporate advertising from public schools failed. Political reform measures – including public financing for legislative campaigns – stalled.

“You have a progressive agenda, you get a few things done, but you also encounter roadblocks,” Pinsky said. “I was hoping some of the things I was talking about would become more mainstream.”

When Miller decided to step down as Senate president in 2019 after 33 years, Pinsky was among a handful of Democrats who kicked the tires on a possible bid to replace him, but eventually abandoned the idea. Baltimore City Sen. Bill Ferguson eventually won Democratic Caucus support unanimously to succeed Miller.

Shortly after Moore was elected governor in 2022, he turned to Pinsky to head the Maryland Energy Administration. Pinsky, who had spent the past year shepherding the climate bill to final passage – and winning an eighth Senate term – was ready for a new challenge. But he also conceded that his desire to “push the envelope” during the Climate Solutions Now debate “created some tensions in the legislature,” which made it a good time to move on.

The MEA director’s role varies from administration to administration. Under Hogan, the MEA became a sleepy agency that shed staff, moved from downtown Annapolis to South Baltimore, and mainly dispensed modest clean energy grants.

Under Moore and Pinsky, the MEA is growing and has played a more central role in the administration’s clean energy and climate strategy.

Just last week, the two announced a $17 million grant program to expand community solar energy use in the state. Although there is an undeniable environmental benefit, the leaders cast the program as a cost-saving measure for certain ratepayers.

“The reason we are so focused on the issue of energy affordability is because we hear from our constituents about it every day,” Moore said. “That’s why we’re taking this important step forward to make energy more sustainable and bring prices down in communities across the state.”

Pinsky last week also headlined a news conference at a union hall in Baltimore, with Van Hollen and environmental leaders, reiterating the state’s commitment to building offshore wind energy projects despite the Trump administration’s opposition.

Pinsky admitted that when he was invited to lead the agency, he didn’t know much about energy policy, despite his years pushing environmental initiatives. But he quickly came to see that energy and climate are inextricably linked, and he has been happy in his role – offering effusive praise for the staff at MEA.

“I’m lucky in getting some pretty smart people around me, who make me look good,” he said. So many staffers, Pinsky said, believe in the agency’s mission, “which is so damn cool.”

But that will soon come to an end. Pinsky has no immediate plans – other than some household chores and spending a week in Belize with his adult daughters, who both live in Washington, D.C. (given his family’s progressive leanings, one daughter once asked him if it would be OK if she took a job in the private sector, Pinsky recalled with a laugh).

In his heart, Pinsky is still a protestor and an organizer – he attended two different “No Kings” rallies in his neighborhood in October. And that will continue even when he’s out of state government.

“You leave whatever mark you can leave,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dsc_0146-1024x6831762367486.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=JqEY6yPC,N,,2025-11-05 20:58:35.682101

The long-held vision of offshore wind turbines being central to these goals endures — for now.","U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race in New Jersey on Tuesday running on a platform of keeping electricity prices down. Environmental groups see Sherrill’s election as a triumph for the Garden State’s struggling offshore wind sector.

Sherrill, a four-term Democrat and a U.S. Navy veteran, arrived on the political scene in 2017 and advocated for offshore wind projects on Capitol Hill. As a gubernatorial candidate, she was one of only three Democrats who explicitly endorsed offshore wind on campaign websites early in the race.

Her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, ran on a promise to ban future offshore wind development. His campaign website sells ​“stop offshore wind” tote bags, t-shirts, stickers, and beverage koozies. Sherrill handily beat Ciattarelli, winning 56% to 43% at press time.

“In-state produced power through offshore wind and other renewable technologies is the only path forward to ensure carbon reduction while prioritizing price stability, economic growth, and resource adequacy,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, an advocacy group whose work is funded in part by wind developers.

Sherrill will take office next year without any offshore wind projects operational or under construction along the state’s roughly 130 miles of coastline. That’s in stark contrast to the other East Coast states that, like New Jersey, have incentivized offshore wind development through tax breaks and have planned grid and clean-energy goals around the sector’s growth. Massachusetts, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island all have installations completed or currently underway.

New Jersey’s incumbent Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, was once a fierce proponent of offshore wind but has ostensibly distanced himself from the sector in recent months as President Donald Trump’s war on offshore wind proved, in some ways, insurmountable for a lame-duck governor.

The Trump administration has frozen the permitting pipeline for all of New Jersey’s earlier-stage offshore projects. Atlantic Shores, the state’s only fully approved wind farm, had one of its federal permits revoked in March by the Environmental Protection Agency. Shell, the project’s codeveloper, officially withdrew from the project last week.

As governor, Sherrill’s ability to counter federal anti-wind policies will be limited. But she can make sure the state remains a player in the industry, which is still advancing in nearby New York. In that state, one project, South Fork Wind, is fully operational, and another, Empire Wind, is under construction.

Sherrill, for example, could expand funding for programs that train workers for wind jobs. She could increase legal pressure against the Trump administration for obstructing certain projects, as Rhode Island and Connecticut have done. New Jersey’s Attorney General Matthew Platkin, along with 17 other attorneys general, is already suing the Trump administration over its broad-reaching executive order that froze federal permitting for wind power.

Her campaign promise to freeze New Jerseyans’ utility rates through a State of Emergency declaration on Day 1 and to push back on federal overreach signifies a willingness to come out fighting.

“Governor-elect Sherrill campaigned on the need for bold action to reduce family energy costs. [The American Clean Power Association] welcomes the Governor-elect’s recognition that clean power is key to meeting demand and keeping costs low,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the trade group, in a statement released shortly after Sherrill’s acceptance speech on Tuesday night.

In January, Sherrill will take the reins from Murphy, who set New Jersey on a path to building a 100% zero-emissions power grid by 2035 but ultimately failed to generate any new offshore wind power. New Jersey voted on Tuesday for a candidate who aims to keep the state’s climate ambitions alive.

Africa’s share of the voluntary carbon market tripled between 2020 and 2024.

Credits are increasingly funding clean cooking and off-grid electrification.

British lender Tandem Bank announced in late October 2025 that it had offset all its 2024 operational emissions by purchasing over 3,300 tons of carbon credits from Climate Impact Partners. The credits were generated from household solar projects in Kenya and Uganda, which provide thousands of homes with reliable electricity while reducing kerosene use. Revenue from the sale of these credits helps sustain and expand such community-based clean energy initiatives.

Carbon credits have become an important climate finance mechanism linking companies in the Global North to high-impact projects in the Global South, particularly across Africa. Issued following independent verification of emission reductions, these credits are purchased by companies to compensate for residual emissions. The voluntary carbon market, where Tandem operates, channels growing private investment into clean energy efforts—mainly in clean cooking and decentralized electrification.

Some African projects are also part of regulated international frameworks such as Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. One example is the Spark+ Africa Fund and Envirofit initiative in Ghana, which completed the first issuance and sale of transferable carbon credits (ITMOs) to Switzerland. The credits were generated from improved cookstove projects that reduce firewood and charcoal use while creating local jobs.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), transactions linked to energy-related carbon credits reached $335 million in 2024, representing less than 0.02% of global clean energy financing. However, Africa’s share of this market has expanded rapidly—from $43 million in 2020 to $143 million in 2024—driven largely by clean cooking projects, which account for more than 80% of regional activity.

Though still modest globally, the carbon credit mechanism is becoming a tangible driver of clean energy access in Africa, supporting off-grid electrification and clean cooking projects that generate not only environmental but also economic, social, and health benefits.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/ebefc1bb0951bb307bd61dd0a1b42ac5_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:20:09.621250

Xcel Energy anticipates that the projects will qualify for federal tax credits, 30% for the Blue Lake battery, 40% for the Sherco battery and solar projects.
Xcel Energy’s plan to expand Sherco Solar with a fourth phase will increase its total capacity to 910MW by 2029.
Sherco Solar, launched in 2024, is the largest solar power plant in the Upper Midwest.
Earlier in October, Xcel proposed building out a 200MW network of distributed battery storage across Minnesota.","Additionally, Xcel states the proposal would add 135.5MW of battery storage at the company’s Blue Lake facility in Shakopee and expand the company’s Sherco Solar facility with an additional 200MW solar array in Clear Lake Township.

This would bring the total BESS deployed to 735.5MW. The company would begin construction on the BESS projects in 2026, aiming to be operational by late 2027. The projects will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell technology.

The batteries will utilise existing grid connections, enabling Xcel Energy to store energy generated from its wind, solar, nuclear, and natural gas facilities across the Upper Midwest. This stored energy can then be released during times of high demand.

According to Xcel, the Sherco battery projects are expected to generate over 150 union construction jobs and approximately US$200 million in local tax revenue.

Additionally, the Blue Lake project is projected to create around 55 construction jobs and contribute US$60 million in local taxes.

Xcel Energy anticipates that the projects will qualify for federal tax credits, 30% for the Blue Lake battery, 40% for the Sherco battery and solar projects.

The company claims it passes these tax credits directly to customers as reduced bills.

Xcel Energy’s plan to expand Sherco Solar with a fourth phase will increase its total capacity to 910MW by 2029. This expansion is projected to generate approximately 300 union construction jobs and bring about US $90 million in local economic benefits.

Sherco Solar, launched in 2024, is the largest solar power plant in the Upper Midwest. The first two phases are already operational, with a third phase under construction that aims to begin supplying electricity to customers in 2026.

Earlier in October, Xcel proposed building out a 200MW network of distributed battery storage across Minnesota.

Under its ‘Capacity*Connect’ proposal, Xcel Energy aims to install up to 200MW of small-scale battery storage across Minnesota by 2028, networked and aggregated as a virtual power plant (VPP) to operate as a front-of-the-meter (FTM) resource.

Partnering with Sparkfund, Xcel explains that these distributed energy resources will help meet increasing electricity demand, provide reliable service, optimise existing infrastructure, and boost local employment.

When this plan was announced, John Farrell, Co-Director of The Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), noted in a post on social media networking site LinkedIn:

What's happening?

California established the California E-Bike Incentive Project, a program designed to provide e-bike voucher incentives to low-income residents, in 2022, opening applications in December 2024.

The program was funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and offered eligible residents up to $2,000 toward the purchase of an e-bike.

According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, CARB spokesperson Lisa Macumber said interest in the program far outstripped the number of available vouchers.

""We had over 150,000 people trying to get into the program, and we only have 1,000 vouchers. It's challenging. It's like getting tickets to a Taylor Swift concert,"" she explained.

Less than a year later, however, the ambitious initiative was unceremoniously axed, and its funding reallocated.

Executive Director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), Kendra Ramsey, told KQED that the decision appeared to stem from the end of federal EV tax credits. Ramsey said that of the $30 million allocated for e-bike vouchers, $17 million will go to an electric vehicle incentive.

Ramsey stated that it was ""really unfortunate"" that federal policy undermined Californians' access to ""really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option.""

She and others with knowledge of the decision were surprised that the popular program was ending, and suggested CARB's silence on the matter spoke volumes.

""It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,"" said San Francisco Bicycle Coalition executive director Christopher White.

Why is this important?

Individuals with knowledge of the program admitted it was imperfect, but as Ramsey emphasized, it offered a clean transportation option to those without the means to buy an electric vehicle.

Unused funds from California's e-bike initiative were expected to go to Clean Cars 4 All.

Typically, it's extremely good news when states pour funding into EV incentives — but in this instance, those funds come at the expense of subsidizing e-bikes, a form of transport accessible to those who cannot or do not wish to drive or own a car.

For all their upsides — and there are many — electric vehicles don't cover all travel needs.

E-bikes offer unique benefits like allowing commuters to get a workout in on the way to work.

What's being done about it?

According to BikingInLA, bicycle advocacy groups have yet to respond to the news, which didn't appear to have been announced in a cohesive manner.

California riders can contact lawmakers to object to the decision.

However, even without vouchers, upgrading to an e-bike is an underrated choice for many commuters and city dwellers. TCD partner Upway is a great place to look for an affordable option, especially since it sells both new and used models often starting as low as about $700.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hsERJKiUuF8KIrtJ1Hnqew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/89b5d82e6964b67a247da15a95219373,N,,2025-11-05 15:20:11.636239

The EPA finalized its original TTR in 2023, under the authority of the AIM Act of 2020. The rule established sector-based GWP limits across all key HVACR-related equipment sectors that use high-GWP HFC refrigerants.

The framework of the original TTR was the culmination of a decade-long process of phasing down HFCs globally and in the U.S. As a result, it incorporated direct feedback and recommendations from stakeholders across all sectors, including food retail, where many are actively working toward their own corporate sustainability goals.

Per the TTR’s compliance deadlines, some key regulations have already taken effect in 2025. These include the 700 GWP limit on residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump equipment, and the 150 GWP limit on self-contained refrigeration.

Recent data suggests that these sectors have not only transitioned successfully to lower-GWP refrigerants but are also experiencing associated business benefits. For example, Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI) reported that as of July, 82% of air conditioning and heat pump shipments were for A2L-based equipment — up from 13% in January. A recent ATMO report also noted that 4.6 million self-contained R-290 cabinets are installed in North America.

Although the new EPA proposal upholds the sector-based GWP limits of those that have already taken effect, it recommends significant delays for transitions that had been planned for the next several months.

Proposed TTR

The EPA’s proposed changes to the TTR extend compliance deadlines five to six years, while raising GWP limits across key sectors in the interim. Some of these changes are detailed below.

Retail food, supermarket racks:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new supermarket systems with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2027.

Proposed changes: 1,400 GWP limit for new supermarket systems, starting January 1, 2027; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting January 1, 2032.

Retail food, condensing units:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new condensing unit systems with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2026.

Proposed changes: 1,400 GWP limit for new condensing units, starting January 1, 2026; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting January 1, 2032.

If implemented in retail food sectors, the interim 1,400 GWP limit would allow HFCs such as R-448A/R-449A to be used through 2032. R-448A/R-449A is considered a lower-GWP HFC alternative to R-404A, which was phased down through previous state-led efforts.

Cold storage warehouse equipment:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new equipment with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2026.

Proposed changes: 700 GWP limit for new equipment, starting on January 1, 2026; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting on January 1, 2032.

For residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, the proposed changes call for removing the installation and/or sell-through restrictions of legacy HFC manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025.

In addition, the new EPA proposal included modifications to the following sectors:

Refrigerated transport — intermodal containers: changes the exemption temperature from -50°C to -35°C.

Industrial process refrigeration: extends the compliance date for equipment with a refrigerant charge of 100 lbs. or less used in the manufacture of semiconductors, from 2026 or 2028 to 2030. Also extends compliance dates for refrigerated centrifuges and laboratory shakers from 2026 to 2028.

Notably, the EPA did not propose changes to the original rule for other sectors, which still face near-term GWP reductions:

Stationary variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioners and heat pumps: 700 GWP limit with an installation compliance date of January 1, 2027;

Data centers, computer room air conditioners, and information technology cooling: 700 GWP limit as of January 1, 2027;

Automatic commercial ice machines (smaller sizes): 150 GWP limit as of January 1, 2026;

Food processing and dispensing equipment: 150 GWP limit as of January 1, 2027; and

Ice cream makers: cannot use 38 restricted refrigerants as of January 1, 2028.

Industry Challenges

The new TTR proposal raises concerns over the ability to align demand for HFCs with the global phasedown schedule, particularly in the retail food refrigeration sector. Extending compliance across key sectors to 2032 as proposed — with a 1,400 GWP threshold for food retail — would directly conflict with the global HFC phasedown established under the AIM Act.

The next step in the HFC phasedown will be in 2029, which will mandate a reduction of supplies down to 30% of the baseline levels. If implemented as proposed, these competing policies could cause demand to outpace supply. Rather than mitigating future refrigerant shortages and price spikes, extending HFC usage another five to six years could have the opposite effect, including:

Potentially intensifying refrigerant pricing and availability pressures for servicing existing systems throughout their useful lifecycles; and

Increasing the potential for stranded assets and early equipment obsolescence.

This raises the question: will there be enough new 1,400 GWP (i.e., R-448A/R-449A) supplies to satisfy increased demand, while staying under the HFC phasedown cap? Refrigerant recovery efforts would need to be practiced and enforced much more rigorously.

Although industry stakeholders can comment on this proposal through November 17, much of the industry has already prepared for the January 1, 2026, compliance deadlines of the final rule, which are currently in effect. For example, new lower-GWP remote condensing units are already entering the distribution channel as planned to meet the January 1, 2026, installation date requirement. If this timeline is delayed by six years as proposed, it could create confusion and potentially strand much of the lower-GWP inventories, as demand for these units might decrease.

From a manufacturing standpoint, the wheels supporting a transition to lower-GWP equipment are already in motion. Significant advancements and investments have been made in the past five years, including an improvement in the efficiency and performance of CO2 refrigeration systems. The industry is also preparing to launch A2L-optimized racks and condensing units.

Most manufacturers in the equipment supply chain have begun sunsetting their legacy HFC offerings. Reworking and restoring these production/manufacturing lines during the interim extension period could incur significant additional costs, which could ultimately be passed on to the end users of this equipment.

Balanced Path

As the EPA states in their reconsideration of the TTR, their goal was to provide flexibility by extending compliance deadlines. However, any short-term benefits could soon be offset by the collective potential for HFC shortages, stranded assets, and other unforeseen supply chain disruptions. Copeland empathizes with the challenges facing small grocers but believes that user-friendly, lower-GWP equipment options, which are cost-competitive with legacy HFC systems, are available today.

Collectively, our industry has already made significant investments, utilizing the opportunities to enhance system reliability, performance, and efficiency — with added application flexibility. We hope that the EPA recognizes the significant progress that has been made and upholds much of the original framework of the TTR. We believe it’s in the industry’s best interest to reconsider the proposal to balance short-term challenges with longer-term, and long-standing, priorities.",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/11/04/Recovery-cylinders-from-Golden-Refrigerants.JPG?height=635&t=1762286794&width=1200,N,,2025-11-05 14:06:27.580926

This marks the EPA’s first enforcement action and settlement with a company for violations of the 2020 rule.

The Accidental Release Reporting Rule, promulgated by the CSB in February 2020 and codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 1604, is part of the chemical accident prevention requirements under section 112(r) of the CAA. The rule requires owners and operators of stationary sources to report to the CSB, within eight hours, any accidental release of regulated or other extremely hazardous substances into the ambient air (including the atmosphere inside or outside a stationary source) that results in fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damage. Reporting a release to the National Response Center (NRC) does not satisfy the rule but does enable streamlined reporting to the CSB. Although the CSB promulgated the rule, the EPA maintains the authority to enforce it.

The announced settlement alleges that on June 8, 2023, an accidental release of natural gas from a Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) facility pipeline in San Jose, California caused a serious injury to a PG&E employee. PG&E reported the release to the NRC the same day, provided a follow up report to NRC two days later, and filed an incident report with the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration on July 3, 2023, and a final revision of that report later in 2023. However, according to the settlement, PG&E did not report the release to the CSB within eight hours, as the rule requires. The CSB’s press release on the settlement states that the company’s failure to report timely occurred “[d]espite being advised by the CSB that the company was required to report the release.” The settlement states PG&E submitted its report to the CSB on April 2, 2025. Under the settlement, which takes the form of a Consent Agreement, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 for the violation of the timely reporting requirement.

The EPA’s press release quotes EPA Deputy Assistant Administrator Cecil Rodrigues for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance: “This settlement clearly signals that EPA will hold companies accountable for not providing CSB with essential information, which can lead to the potential for loss of life, injury, or property damage.” The press release also notes, “Failure to report incidents such as these hinder the CSB’s ability to investigate accidental releases, determine probable causes of those releases, and recommend measures to prevent future occurrences.” And finally, “This settlement further reinforces the partnership between the CSB and EPA in promoting chemical safety and preventing accidental releases.”

Earning the favor of 70% of voters in Tuesday’s election, Proposition 4 requires the state to allocate $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades.

Those can include flood mitigation, new water sources, wastewater treatment plant expansions and conservation.

While significant, the new money is not enough for needs across the state though it will play a major role in keeping water affordable, said Dan Buhman, Tarrant Regional Water District general manager, after election results.

“State funding has saved us millions of dollars,” he said. “It’s an important investment that the state makes in our water supply reliability and affordability.”

In the weeks approaching the election, local officials expressed concern about the need to do more to secure new water sources.

“(Prop 4) is only a drop in the bucket,” said state Rep. Ramon Romero, D-Fort Worth, during the Fort Worth Report’s recent 1 Million & Counting Growth Summit. To keep up with the city’s increasing population, he stressed, “We have a long, long way to go.”

Among the largest challenges to securing water supplies are costs and the amount of authority given to local officials, Buhman said at the event.

The local water district’s resources provide water to 2.5 million residents in the North Texas area, but that’s not enough to keep up with needs, according to state projections. Tarrant County will need over 673,000 acre-feet of water — which is about four times as large as the capacity of Eagle Mountain Lake — by 2080.

The state’s new funds to address that need will help overcome some of the cost as that money goes to the Texas Water Fund, which was created by lawmakers in 2023 to address the state’s rapidly growing population, water demands and aging transmission lines.

However, building expensive new reservoirs — the natural or human-made lakes used to store water — may still be difficult to accomplish. Such projects, which can top billions of dollars, often face opposition due to land acquisitions and environmental impacts.

“What we saw this last legislative session is the desire to invest money, but also a desire to kill water ideas,” Buhman said at the event.

For example, a failed bill would have required the Texas Water Development Board — the agency responsible for statewide water planning — to scrap reservoirs from planning if construction had not begun within 50 years.

That would have included the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, a project that’s been in planning for the Dallas-Fort Worth area since the 1960s but has faced ongoing pushback from communities in the East Texas area of the state where it is planned to be built.

Tarrant County officials consider projects in other parts of the state, but costs for new water resources skyrocket the further they are, Buhman urged.

“Our duty is to provide water at a reasonable cost,” he said at the summit. “If the state can invest money … and participate in that increased cost … that makes a lot of sense to me.”

How does Proposition 4 work?

By 2027, officials must allocate the first $1 billion of state revenue that exceeds $46.5 billion in sales taxes annually to the Texas Water Fund.

About half of that money set aside each year will be dedicated for major projects, such as fixing leaky transmission lines, wastewater and desalination plants, flood control and new reservoirs.

The Texas Water Development Board administers the Texas Water Fund, directing dollars toward projects for local communities.

Texas’ population is projected to grow by 53% between 2030 and 2080, from 34 million to 52 million, according to state estimates.

Securing resources and fixing broken or deteriorating water systems are among the state’s greatest needs, according to a report from nonprofit think tank Texas 2036. Addressing those needs requires $154 billion in funds within the next 20 years.

Now, state water board officials must determine which communities have the greatest need for the new fund, creating competition.

Earning a chunk of the annual $1 billion could largely help some of the new projects being planned at the water district, such as new reservoirs and out-of-state resources.

“All of those (projects) are eligible,” Buhman said. “It will just be a question of which ones the (state) wants to fund.”

Millions of American homeowners may not be aware that key financial incentives and tax credits will no longer be available at the end of this calendar year.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA’s federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key — homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

“AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,” said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

“A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,” said Sherman.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear.","Fossil fuels still power much of the world, even though renewable energy has become cheaper in most places and avoids both pollution and the climate damage caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas.

To understand this paradox, it helps to look at how countries – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China and European nations – are balancing the pressures of rising electricity demand with the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.

US embraces fossil fuels

The United States makes no secret of its fossil fuel ambitions. It has a wealth of fossil fuel reserves and a politically powerful oil and gas industry.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has been promoting oil and gas drilling and coal production, pointing to rising electricity demand to justify its moves, particularly to power artificial intelligence data centers.

Reviving the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the Trump administration has now embraced a “mine, baby, mine” agenda to try to revive U.S. coal production, which fell dramatically over the past two decades as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy rose.

The Department of Interior on Sept. 29 rolled out a plan to “unleash American coal power” by opening 13 million acres of federal land to mining. The Department of Energy also pledged $625 million to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants.

However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have public health costs. Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States.

The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is ending many renewable energy tax credits and pulling federal support for energy research projects.

I work in the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets.

The Trump administration’s 2026 U.S. budget request would slash funding for energy research, development and demonstration to $2.9 billion — just over half the budget allocated in 2025. These energy research investments would fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s or early 2000s, even when accounting for inflation.

China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion

While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies. Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China dominate global solar panel production and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles.

Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh.

The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to double by 2030, even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth.

However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its production and emissions from coal continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned 21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants, with projections of over 80 GW for the full year.

This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to phase down its coal use between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.

China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.

Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources

The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a global energy crisis as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.

In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the broader REPowerEU plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.

Renewables are now the leading source of electric power in the EU, though natural gas and oil still account for more than half of Europe’s total energy supply.

The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas. Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%.

The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which hit a record high in the first half of 2025, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.

Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks

This month, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise.

The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while expanding oil and gas production and exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas region, the mouth of the Amazon River.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is not on track to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why.

Negotiators are expected to debate measures to curb methane emissions and support the transition from fossil fuels. But whether the discussions can eventually translate into a concrete global phaseout plan remains to be seen. Without credible plans to actually reduce fossil fuel dependence, the annual climate talks risk becoming another point of geopolitical tension.

Key Takeaways from the REWI Summary In recent decades, extensive research has examined how land-based wind energy interacts with wildlife and their habitats.
Responsibly sited and operated land-based wind energy projects are essential to safeguarding the future of birds and people.","The 2025 U.S. State of the Birds report revealed that birds are suffering rapid population declines across the United States from impacts like habitat loss. Audubon’s science shows that two-thirds of North American bird species are at risk of extinction unless we take bold action to cut pollution and slow the rise in global temperatures. Increasingly extreme weather conditions and shifting seasons are already altering ecosystems and threatening species’ survival.

When done responsibly, developing more land-based wind energy can help protect birds from these escalating threats. As demand for energy continues to grow, it is essential that we plan thoughtfully for how to meet those needs. Wind energy is one of many ways that human activities interact with bird populations and habitats, with other structures like buildings having greater impacts, and research efforts over the last several decades have continued to improve understanding to avoid or minimize risks. That's why Audubon advocates for planning and siting projects based on the best available science and working with local communities to ensure that development benefits both people and wildlife.

The latest publication from the Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute (REWI), Wind Energy Interactions with Wildlife: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions Based on the State of the Science, provides a comprehensive summary of publicly available information about how land-based wind power interacts with birds and bats in North America. It also highlights the latest strategies to avoid and minimize impacts like collisions and habitat degradation, underscoring that early and meaningful engagement with state wildlife management agencies, careful planning, research, and collaboration can help advance the clean energy projects we need.

Responsible Land-Based Wind Development

Responsible wind development involves siting and operating projects in ways that advance renewable energy while reducing risks to birds and other wildlife. Best practices and advanced mapping are used to identify low-conflict areas and avoid sites that are critical for birds. Collision-reducing technologies, conservation offsets for any unavoidable impacts, and rigorous monitoring before and after construction also help ensure that projects continue to minimize impacts to birds over time.

Audubon is a founder and Board member of REWI, an independent nonprofit convening renewable energy companies, conservation and science organizations, and public agencies to develop and leverage peer-reviewed science on renewable energy, wildlife, and ecosystems. With over 120 years of conservation science, Audubon works with developers and decision-makers on responsible land-based wind energy development.

For example, Audubon’s collaboration with wind projects in the Tehachapi Mountains of California resulted in experimentation with advanced technologies to detect Golden Eagles and California Condors if they enter a project area in order to turn the turbines off in around 30 seconds. Many of the wind projects also provided conservation benefits to California Condors in advance through captive breeding programs and other measures through a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) permit that provides conservation before any Condors have been harmed. Since then, no Condors have been killed or injured at a wind project and the population has grown through the permit.

Key Takeaways from the REWI Summary

In recent decades, extensive research has examined how land-based wind energy interacts with wildlife and their habitats. Audubon has been part of these efforts since the first meeting of the National Wind Coordinating Collaborative (NWCC), a precursor to REWI, in 1994. REWI’s summary synthesizes publicly available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies conducted by professional biologists and analyzed using rigorous, impartial methods.

For many birds, the current rate of estimated mortality from wind turbines would not be expected to have a population-level impact. The species most frequently affected by turbine collisions tend to be common perching birds like Mourning Doves with large populations and high reproductive rates. For these species, the impact from wind turbines is typically less than 0.02 percent of their total population, which is remarkably low compared to other, far more widespread causes of bird mortality such as building collisions.

However, some bird species are more vulnerable to population level impacts than others. Species with declining populations that are sensitive to any additional sources of mortality or disturbance, such as Greater Sage-Grouse, Ferruginous Hawk, and Lesser Prairie Chicken, are a high priority for Audubon when engaging on a wind project. A 2020 report from USFWS revealed that populations of Golden Eagles are stable, but cumulative impacts from various stressors like lead poisoning, shooting, and electrocution on power lines may contribute to further declines. Because Golden Eagles have relatively small populations and slow reproductive rates, any additional mortality from turbine collisions can have a greater impact on their overall population trajectory.

New technologies are currently deployed at wind projects to minimize the risks for those species that could have elevated levels of impact from wind energy. For example, camera-based systems coupled with machine vision algorithms can detect and classify raptors like Golden Eagles in real time and can substantially reduce fatalities by automatically shutting down turbines. Research continues in additional technologies and operating practices that may avoid and minimize harm to birds like contrast painting of turbine blades.

Responsibly sited and operated land-based wind energy projects are essential to safeguarding the future of birds and people. Researchers, conservationists, and industry partners are working together to develop and implement strategies to avoid, minimize, monitor, and offset impacts. With the best available science, continued collaboration, and community input, we can build a clean energy future that benefits the climate, people, and conservation.",https://media.audubon.org/2025-10/WEB_Aud_Manzana-Wind_240206-0310_Photo-Sydney-Walsh.jpg?width=1200&height=630&auto=webp&quality=90&fit=crop&enable=upscale,N,,2025-11-05 15:20:35.450024

Storage revenue surges

Nevada-based Ormat is an independent power producer that operates a 1.6-GW portfolio of geothermal, waste heat recovery, solar and energy storage resources with assets in the United States, Kenya, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It aims to nearly double its energy generation and storage capacity by the end of 2028, executives said on a third-quarter earnings call Tuesday.

Ormat earned $24.1 million profit in the third quarter, up 9.3% from $22.1 million a year ago. Its Q3 2025 revenue was $249.7 million, an increase of nearly 18% from the third quarter of 2024.

Ormat saw strong performance in its products and energy storage segments, which respectively account for 25% and 8% of its total sales. Storage was the standout, posting 108% growth year over year thanks to favorable seasonality and higher capacity prices in the PJM Interconnection.

The electricity segment accounts for 67% of Ormat’s sales. It was noticeably weaker this quarter due to a September storm that knocked out the grid near the company’s southern California assets, curtailments related to transmission upgrades in Nevada and lower energy prices in Hawaii.

On Tuesday, Ormat Chief Financial Officer Assaf Ginzburg said the curtailments could cost Ormat $40 million to $50 million this year. But CEO Doron Blachar characterized the issues as one-offs and said the company did not expect a repeat in 2026.

Ormat expects to book about $167 million from tax equity financing and tax credit transfer transactions this year, higher than previously forecast. It sees $50.4 million in net tax benefits from the investment and production tax credits for energy storage and geothermal authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and extended in full through 2033 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Ormat expects to grow its energy generation and storage capacity by 15% to 17% annually through 2028. In its core electricity segment, it sees 162 MW of solar growth and 240 MW to 340 MW of geothermal growth. Though a significant portion of its planned geothermal additions are slated for non-U.S. markets like Indonesia, Blachar said Ormat feels good about its projects in resource-rich Nevada despite a recent 10-fold increase in geothermal proposals entering NV Energy’s interconnection queue.

Updates on two enhanced geothermal partnerships

Ormat announced enhanced geothermal, or EGS, partnerships with SLB and Sage Geosystems earlier this year.

“We have achieved significant progress in advancing our EGS strategy,” Blachar said on Tuesday. He cautioned, however, that the partnerships likely would not accrue to Ormat’s capacity pipeline until after 2028.

The SLB partnership is a joint venture that Blachar said would blend SLB’s drilling and subsurface engineering expertise with Ormat’s thermal power plant design, development and operation. The first phase is a pilot project that could be operational in late 2026 at Ormat’s Desert Peak plant in Nevada — a significantly shorter headway than building a new facility for the project. If successful, Ormat and SLB would jointly develop commercial-scale power plants for independent power producers, utilities and large industrial customers.

The Sage pilot would follow a similar timeline, but the Texas-based startup is still deciding on a site, Blachar said. In August, Sage CEO Cindy Taff told Latitude Media that it was considering three sites in Nevada and Utah. If the pilot pans out, Ormat could then develop, build, own and operate geothermal power plants and energy storage facilities — including long-duration storage — using Sage’s EGS technology.

In both cases, Blachar said, each commercial-scale EGS facility could have hundreds of megawatts of capacity, compared with a few tens of megawatts at most traditional geothermal sites.

Strong energy storage growth and pipeline

Revenues in Ormat’s energy storage business more than doubled in the third quarter, albeit from a low base.

But that base is growing quickly as Ormat plans to add 660 MW to 760 MW of capacity over the next three years, upsizing its storage portfolio from 290 MW today to as much as 1,050 MW by the end of 2028. Ormat commissioned a 60 MW/120 MWh project in Texas last quarter and plans to bring an additional 175 MW/580 MWh online across three projects in California and Texas by the end of 2026.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s foreign sourcing rules remain a concern for Ormat given industrywide dependence on Chinese components, Blachar said. The company had “safe-harbored whatever we could” to reduce the near-term impacts on tax credit eligibility, he added, referring to the practice of beginning work on energy projects to grandfather them into existing tax rules.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EIyLtm66cSdYNqYzvzA2Prfwdk-beVWHkw6gZS2HpQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Pcm1hdF9nZW90aGVybWFsLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-05 14:05:43.609292

The 1977 law that Mr. Trump relies on, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, might seem to fail that test, as it does not feature the word “tariffs” or similar terms like “duties,” “customs,” “taxes” or “imposts.”

There is no question that the tariffs will have vast economic consequences, measured in the trillions of dollars. The sums involved are far larger than the roughly $500 billion at issue in President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s student loan forgiveness program, which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, called “staggering by any measure” and struck down for running afoul of the major questions doctrine.

The doctrine, a judicially created principle of statutory interpretation, is of relatively recent vintage. It follows the premise that Congress does not “hide elephants in mouse holes,” as Justice Antonin Scalia put it in a 2001 opinion. That is to say, if Congress wants to give the president power to take major economic action, it will say so plainly.

The actual words “major questions doctrine” did not appear in a majority opinion until 2022, when Chief Justice Roberts cited them to curtail the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to address climate change. Without “clear congressional authorization,” he wrote, the agency could not act.

That ruling was part of a trend. The court also used the doctrine to reject other elements of the Biden administration’s agenda, including its efforts to address the Covid-19 pandemic and student debt.

The court’s commitment to the doctrine will be tested in its approach to the tariffs program.

In a concurring opinion in June in an unrelated case, however, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh proposed a distinction that could lay the groundwork for a decision in Mr. Trump’s favor despite the doctrine.

“The major questions canon has not been applied by this court in the national security or foreign policy contexts,” he wrote, adding, “The usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the president substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/05/multimedia/05scotus-tariffs-major-questions-bvjp/05scotus-tariffs-major-questions-bvjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 14:06:36.145138

Instead of focusing on the electric vehicle as a breakthrough technology, Washington framed it as an environmental issue — one that remains politically divisive.
Electric vehicles are not just clean cars, but rather computers on wheels, connected to data, chips and infrastructure.
Losing the electric vehicle race means losing leverage over critical technology standards, supply chains and industrial jobs.
In China, electric vehicles are now at the center of innovation.","While Beijing built gigafactories, the United States debated tax credits. China saw electric vehicles as an industrial strategy — we saw them as climate policy. Now, China commands 60 percent of global battery electric vehicle sales and dominates the battery supply chain that will power tomorrow’s cars, trucks and buses. America barely reaches 16 percent.

It didn’t have to be this way. It was an American company — Tesla — that reintroduced electric vehicles into modern driving. In 2009, Tesla announced its first all-electric Model S, and began delivering them four years later. Affluent American consumers rushed to buy this new “it” car — but most Americans balked at its high price tag. China jumped at the opportunity to industrialize: it took the concept pioneered by Tesla and transformed it into a mass-market revolution.

By 2015, China had already surpassed the United States in domestic battery electric vehicle sales. Although many of these were Teslas, China’s early adoption signaled where the industry was heading.

That same year, Beijing launched “Made in China 2025,” an industrial policy to accelerate advanced manufacturing capabilities and reduce foreign dependence. But China’s leaders had identified “new energy vehicles” as a strategic sector long before that — as early as 2006 — and followed up with a National Energy-Saving and New Energy Vehicle Development Plan in 2012. When “Made in China 2025” elevated electric vehicles as a national priority, the industry exploded.

Meanwhile, the U.S. took a wrong turn. Instead of focusing on the electric vehicle as a breakthrough technology, Washington framed it as an environmental issue — one that remains politically divisive.

American policy solutions suffered as a result. The $3,400 federal tax credit introduced in 2005 — later raised to $7,500 — was the most ambitious measure we had. (It expired on Sept. 30.) States added rebates and HOV lane access, but these incentives aimed to change consumer behavior, not to strengthen American manufacturing. That narrow framing had global consequences. While we debated environmental incentives, China was building the foundations of a new industrial order. Today, the world’s leading electric vehicle producers are increasingly Chinese.

Electric vehicles are not just clean cars, but rather computers on wheels, connected to data, chips and infrastructure. Losing the electric vehicle race means losing leverage over critical technology standards, supply chains and industrial jobs. This isn’t just about automakers; it’s about national power and the future of our tech ecosystem.

In China, electric vehicles are now at the center of innovation. Companies are integrating augmented reality entertainment systems, artificial intelligence-assisted driving, and even rooftop drone installations, alongside advances in fast charging and battery design. Beijing is now rolling out its intelligent connected vehicle strategy that integrates vehicles with roads and cloud systems through AI-driven networks. If China exports this ecosystem globally, non-connected U.S. and allied vehicles risk being locked out of future markets.

The U.S. must start treating electric vehicles as an advanced technology sector central to our economic competitiveness and innovation power. National leaders should move beyond purchase subsidies to focus on industrial build-out, software-defined vehicle research and development, and secure data infrastructure.

And we don’t have to do it alone. Allies from Japan to Germany face the same challenge. Joint battery production, shared industrial standards, and coordinated investment can strengthen all our industries — together.

Electric vehicles aren’t a climate accessory. They’re the next platform for global technological power. America can’t afford to sit in the passenger seat.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Mr. Richard Francis, Teva's President and CEO, said, “Our innovative portfolio driving the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in the third quarter reflects the accelerating momentum of our transformation and the strength of our innovation-led Pivot to Growth strategy. Our key growth drivers—particularly our innovative medicines—delivered a 33% increase in local currency, underscoring their impact on both patient outcomes and our financial performance. As we continue executing our strategy, we remain firmly on track to reach our 30% non-GAAP operating profit margin by 2027 and ~$700 million of net savings target.”

Mr. Francis added, “Following the conclusion of the IRA pricing negotiations, we are reiterating our strong confidence in our AUSTEDO 2027 target. Our differentiated innovative portfolio is now a defining strength for Teva as we transform into a leading innovative biopharma, while our world-class generics business continues to provide a resilient foundation. With our talented team and unwavering commitment to patients, we are confident about Teva’s future and our ability to deliver enduring value to all our stakeholders.”

Pivot to Growth Strategy

In the third quarter of 2025, we continued to execute on the four key pillars of our “Pivot to Growth” strategy, announced in May 2023. As part of this strategy, in the second quarter of 2025 Teva entered its ""Accelerate Growth"" phase, during which we expect to focus on growing our innovative portfolio, aligning capital allocation to invest in activities we expect to have the highest value, and modernizing our organization and operations to drive both efficiency and cost savings.

Delivering on our Growth Engines - on the first pillar, our key innovative brands – AUSTEDO, AJOVY and UZEDY – continued to demonstrate strong performance. Collectively, these products grew ~33% in Q3 2025 YoY in local currency. For AUSTEDO, we are raising the 2025 revenue outlook by $50 million - $100 million to a new range of $2,050 million - $2,150 million. For AJOVY and UZEDY, we are reaffirming our previous outlooks of $630 million - $640 million and $190 million - $200 million, respectively. The conclusion of the IRA pricing negotiations reinforces confidence in our long-term outlook for AUSTEDO. We are on track for our 2027 revenue target of >$2.5 billion for AUSTEDO and peak year revenue target of >$3 billion. During the third quarter of 2025, the FDA approved an expansion of AJOVY's indication, to include its use as an anti-CGRP preventive treatment for pediatric episodic migraine in patients aged 6 to17 years who weigh 45 kg or more. This approval marks an important step in Teva’s efforts to advance care for neurological conditions.

Stepping Up Innovation - on the second pillar, we continued to accelerate the development of certain key pipeline assets. For olanzapine LAI, we presented new long-term safety data from the SOLARIS Trial with no PDSS observed and anticipate filing its New Drug Application (NDA) in Q4 2025. Teva’s investigational therapy emrusolmin (TEV-56286) received U.S. FDA Fast Track designation for the treatment of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), a rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease with no approved treatments to slow its progression —another step forward in Teva’s commitment to advancing innovative neuroscience therapies. Phase 3 programs for duvakitug (anti-TL1A) in UC and CD were initiated by Sanofi and Teva in October 2025; on track to achieve target enrollment levels in the adult and pediatric populations for DARI’s (Dual-action Asthma Rescue Inhaler) Phase 3 trial at the end of 2025.

Sustaining Our Generics Powerhouse - on the third pillar, we remain focused on strengthening our world-class global generics business with a streamlined portfolio of high-value complex generics and biosimilars, a robust pipeline, and an integrated global manufacturing and commercial footprint. In the U.S., we received FDA approval and launched liraglutide injection (the generic version of Saxenda®), the first-ever generic GLP-1 treatment indicated for weight loss. This milestone strengthens Teva’s complex generics portfolio, expanding access to effective weight management options for adults and adolescents. Our recently launched biosimilars – SIMLANDI® (adalimumab-ryvk), SELARSDITM (ustekinumab-aekn) and EPYSQLI® (eculizumab-aagh) – continue to grow as does our legacy biosimilar portfolio.

Focusing our Business - Lastly, on the fourth pillar, to accelerate our growth, we are actively transforming and modernizing our business through Teva Transformation programs. On May 7, 2025, we announced that these programs are expected to generate ~$700 million of net savings through 2027. We are on track to achieving our targeted savings for 2025.

Teva continues in its effort to sell its active-pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business. Exclusive discussions with a selected buyer on the sale have terminated. Teva is initiating a renewed sales process, maintaining its strategic intention to divest its API business. On December 31, 2024, Teva classified the business (including its R&D, manufacturing and commercial activities) as held for sale.

Third Quarter 2025 Consolidated Results

Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $4,480 million, an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars, or 1% in local currency terms compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues from AUSTEDO and from generic products including biosimilars in our U.S. segment, partially offset by lower revenues from generic products in our International Markets segment due to the divestment of our business venture in Japan, from generic products in our Europe segment, and from certain other innovative products in all of our segments, as well as lower year-over-year proceeds from the sale of certain product rights.

Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2025, net of hedging effects, positively impacted revenues by $106 million, compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2025, including hedging effects, had a positive impact of $21 million on our operating income and non-GAAP operating income compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $2,304 million, an increase of 7% compared to $2,148 million in the third quarter of 2024. Gross profit margin was 51.4% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 49.6% in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit was $2,475 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 6% compared to $2,327 million in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 55.3% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 53.7% in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in both gross profit margin and non-GAAP gross profit margin was mainly due to higher revenues from AUSTEDO.

Research and Development (R&D) expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 were $256 million, an increase of 7% compared to $240 million in the third quarter of 2024. Our higher R&D expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, were mainly due to an increase in immunology projects, partially offset by a decrease in our late-stage innovative pipeline in neuroscience (mainly neuropsychiatry), which was also impacted by a reimbursement from our strategic partnerships in the third quarter of 2024.

Selling and Marketing (S&M) expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $656 million, an increase of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly to support revenue growth in our key innovative products and in generic products.

General and Administrative (G&A) expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $317 million, an increase of 6% compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to costs related to optimization activities of Teva’s global organization and operations in connection with Teva’s Transformation programs, as well as a negative impact from exchange rate fluctuations.

Other loss in the third quarter of 2025 was $7 million, compared to other income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2024. Other income in the third quarter of 2024 included a capital gain from the sale of a business in our International Markets segment.

Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $882 million, compared to an operating loss of $51 million in the third quarter of 2024. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 19.7% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an operating loss as a percentage of revenues of 1.2% in the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to the goodwill impairment charge and higher legal settlements and loss contingencies recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $1,294 million representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.9% compared to $1,214 million representing 28.0%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter of 2025 was due to higher gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.

Financial expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 were $237 million, mainly comprised of net-interest expenses of $209 million. In the third quarter of 2024, financial expenses, net were $272 million, mainly comprised of net-interest expenses of $225 million and a negative exchange rate impact, driven mainly from currencies which we were unable to hedge.

In the third quarter of 2025, we recognized a tax expense of $214 million, on a pre-tax income of $646 million. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a tax expense of $69 million, on a pre-tax loss of $324 million.

Non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2025 was 14.7%, compared to 16.0% in the third quarter of 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2025 was mainly affected by changes in deferred tax balances due to statutory tax rate changes and interest and inflation adjustments related to the agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was mainly affected by the generation of profits in various jurisdictions with different tax rates, an adjustment to Teva’s corporate tax rate in Israel on losses related to non-qualified tax incentive activities in Israel, recording of valuation allowance with respect to certain carry over credits outside of Israel, as well as infrequent or non-recurring items.

We expect our annual non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 to be between 15%-18%, slightly higher than our non-GAAP tax rate for 2024, which was 15.3%, mainly due to a net tax benefit related to deferred tax assets resulting from intellectual property-related integration plans in 2024.

Net income attributable to Teva and diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2025 were $433 million and $0.37, respectively, compared to a net loss attributable to Teva and loss per share of $437 million and $0.39, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. This change was mainly due to higher operating income in the third quarter of 2025, partially offset by higher income taxes, as discussed above. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2025 were $910 million and $0.78, respectively, compared to $798 million and $0.69, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,394 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 5%, compared to $1,327 million in the third quarter of 2024.

As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, the fully diluted share count for purposes of calculating our market capitalization was approximately 1,184 million shares and 1,167 million shares, respectively.

Non-GAAP information: non-GAAP adjustments for non-GAAP net income attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter of 2025 were $478 million and consisted of the following adjustments:

Amortization of purchased intangible assets of $144 million, of which $134 million is included in cost of sales and the remaining $10 million in S&M expenses;

Impairment of long-lived assets of $79 million;

Legal settlements and loss contingencies of $60 million;

Contingent consideration expenses of $16 million;

Equity compensation expenses of $34 million;

Restructuring expenses of $29 million;

Financial expenses of $7 million;

Other non-GAAP items of $51 million; and

Corresponding tax effects and unusual tax items of $58 million.

We believe that excluding such items facilitates investors’ understanding of our business including underlying trends, thereby improving the comparability of our business performance results between reporting periods.

For a reconciliation of the U.S. GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures and for additional information, see the tables below and the information included under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacement for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Cash flow generated from operating activities during the third quarter of 2025 was $369 million, compared to $693 million in the third quarter of 2024. The lower cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2025 was mainly due to timing of sales and collections, as well as higher legal settlement payments, partially offset by lower tax payments and higher profit.

During the third quarter of 2025, we generated free cash flow of $515 million, which we define as comprising $369 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, $274 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and $8 million of proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by $136 million in cash used for capital investment. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated free cash flow of $922 million, which we define as comprising $693 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, $339 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and $38 million in divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by $148 million in cash used for capital investment. The decrease in the third quarter of 2025 mainly resulted from lower cash flow generated from operating activities, as well as a decrease in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets.

As of September 30, 2025, our debt was $16,790 million, compared to $17,783 million as of December 31, 2024. This decrease was mainly due to repayment at maturity of $1,812 million of our senior notes, partially offset by an increase of $791 million due to exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2025, we repurchased $2,290 million aggregate principal amount of notes upon consummation of a cash tender offer, and issued $2,298 million of senior notes, net of discount and issuance costs. The portion of total debt classified as short-term as of September 30, 2025 was negligible compared to 10% as of December 31, 2024. Our average debt maturity was approximately 5.85 years as of September 30, 2025, compared to 5.5 years as of December 31, 2024.

Generic products (including biosimilars) revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2025 were $1,175 million, an increase of 7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly driven by higher revenues from our portfolio of biosimilar products.

Among the most significant generic products we sold in the United States in the third quarter of 2025 were lenalidomide capsules (the generic version of Revlimid®), epinephrine injectable solution (the generic equivalent of EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr®) and Truxima® (the biosimilar to Rituxan®). In the third quarter of 2025, our total prescriptions were approximately 261 million (based on trailing twelve months), representing 6.7% of total U.S. generic prescriptions, compared to approximately 292 million (based on trailing twelve months), representing 7.6% of total U.S. generic prescriptions in the third quarter of 2024, all according to IQVIA data.

AJOVY revenues in our United States segment in the third quarter of 2025 were $73 million, an increase of 27% compared to the third quarter of 2024, mainly due to growth in volume. In the third quarter of 2025, AJOVY’s exit market share in the United States in terms of total number of prescriptions was 32.0% out of the subcutaneous injectable anti-CGRP class, compared to 29.1% in the third quarter of 2024.

During the third quarter of 2025, Teva and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) negotiated a maximum fair price for the AUSTEDO products, based on CMS’s list of prescription medicines selected for price-setting discussions, in which they were originally included.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted EPS, are presented in order to facilitate investors' understanding of our business. We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how we utilize the non-GAAP measures: our management and board of directors use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational performance and, to compare our results against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management; our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using these non-GAAP measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are not providing forward looking guidance for GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items including, but not limited to, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, legal settlements and loss contingencies, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill impairment, without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Power report.","The rationale behind N.B. Power’s controversial decision to build a gas-fired power plant on a 550-acre woodlot is outlined in a recent report from the utility, but critics aren’t buying it.

In December 2024, N.B. Power told reporters the major new gas plant would likely be built in the Scoudouc Industrial Park, about 22 kilometres northeast of Moncton.

But according to the two-page report, the utility decided just two months later that it would instead go with property near Centre Village in rural Tantramar.

N.B. Power and ProEnergy, the U.S. company hired to build and operate the plant, are now building a 1.5-kilometre road to get to the chosen site.

But local conservation groups say a gas plant makes much more sense in an industrial park than in the middle of the Chignecto Isthmus.

“I think that we have to, as New Brunswickers, raise our standards a little bit about where we put these kinds of projects,” said Melanie Jellett, conservation manager with the New Brunswick chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.

“A project of this size should not be built in an ecologically sensitive area like this. It's much better in an area where there's already industrial development.”

The decision to build in Centre Village didn’t become public until N.B. Power formally announced its plans in July 2025, inspiring an outcry from local residents and conservation groups.

Scoudouc, Centre Village topped list of choices

In its “location analysis” report, N.B. Power listed 10 sites that it considered, including Coleson Cove, Lepreau, Millbank, Belledune and Dalhousie. The utility quickly narrowed the field to five worthy of “detailed review.”

Eel River, Bayside, and Memramcook were ruled out because of “transmission constraints” and lack of “proximity to natural gas pipelines.”

That left Scoudouc and Centre Village offering “the greatest value and most suitable conditions.""

Both properties are crossed by N.B. Power transmission lines and the Maritimes and Northeast natural gas pipeline.

Both could also “support the 500-megawatt capacity with minimal transmission investment,” and both are in the southeast, where they could address growing energy demand and “support eastward transfers (to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island),” according to the N.B. Power report.

N.B. Power says it studied the ""regulatory context” for both sites in the summer of 2024, something that would be a key factor in the utility’s decision to go with Centre Village.

The report concluded the Scoudouc site has more wetland than Centre Village, which could require Fisheries Act authorization, resulting in a delay of up to 18 months.

It also notes the “discovery of evidence of pileated woodpecker nests” on the Scoudouc site. That would mean a 36-month waiting period under Canada’s Migratory Bird Convention Act.

N.B. Power said the potential delays at the Scoudouc site were major considerations, and “critical to ensuring project completion by 2028,” when the utility is projecting energy shortfalls in the province.

Speed as a deciding factor questioned

“The biggest thing that's pushing them is this timeline,” said Barry Rothfuss, director of the Atlantic Wildlife Institute, which lies about four kilometres away as the crow flies.

“Everything that they're talking about … has to do with them being able to build an infrastructure project in an expedited manner,” he said.

The Scoudouc and Centre Village sites are “not even comparable” from a biodiversity perspective, said Rothfuss.

“This is a far more ecologically sensitive habitat.”

And the Centre Village site likely contains habitat for important species such as the pileated woodpecker, Rothfuss said.

“We've had photographic evidence and also GPS co-ordinates sent identifying that there is pileated woodpecker activity on this site,” he said.

Centre Village is also a central location on the Chignecto Isthmus, which Jellett said has been identified as an “important area for ecological connectivity” because of wildlife such as moose, bear and lynx that migrate across the land bridge between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Jellett also questioned the report’s conclusions about wetlands, noting that the access road under construction at Centre Village cuts across Harper’s Brook.

A provincial environmental impact assessment is underway for the project, and a technical review committee has issued 97 comments and questions, some still to be answered by ProEnergy.

Even so, Environment Minister Gilles LePage has already ruled out a possible “comprehensive” assessment process.

Rothfuss agreed that “there's no need for a long, extensive EIA process.”

Kunse believes the shift will be revenue neutral, as the sales tax is reduced to zero.
""We're going to raise the fuel tax, but we're going to lower the sales tax.
Typically, with that percentage-based sales tax, the state would come out way better when gas prices were much higher,"" he said.
In addition to the fuel tax changes, a fixed rate for hybrid and electric vehicles will be implemented when they register.","Michigan lawmakers have enacted a significant change to the state's fuel tax structure, eliminating the 6% sales tax on fuel and increasing the motor fuel tax rate to 52.6 cents per gallon, up from the current 31 cents.

The legislation, which takes effect in January, aims to address road infrastructure issues without raising new money at the pump, according to Republican lawmaker Tom Kunse. ""We are not trying to raise new money at the pump. So we just want to take all the money, pay it at the pump and put it on the roads,"" Kunse said.

Kunse believes the shift will be revenue neutral, as the sales tax is reduced to zero. ""We're going to raise the fuel tax, but we're going to lower the sales tax. We took the sales tax to zero. So our goal was to make this revenue neutral,"" he explained.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that the change might not be immediately noticeable to drivers due to the cyclical nature of Michigan's gas prices. ""The way Michigan's gas prices work is they cycle every week and a half to two weeks. They make a big jump up just like they did earlier this week when prices jumped up to $3.29. So you probably won't notice on January 1st, a big jump,"" De Haan said.

According to De Haan, if prices at the pump remain what they are today, people will pay an additional seven cents per gallon.

De Haan also pointed out that the state will not benefit from higher gas prices as it did with the percentage-based sales tax. ""The state will not benefit when gas prices reach $4 or $5. Typically, with that percentage-based sales tax, the state would come out way better when gas prices were much higher,"" he said.

In addition to the fuel tax changes, a fixed rate for hybrid and electric vehicles will be implemented when they register.

Most states do not have a double tax like Michigan's current system, making this overhaul a notable shift in the state's approach to fuel taxation.",https://midmichigannow.com/resources/media/aa3b98e8-c25f-46a1-ba88-285fbe3022e3-GasPrices2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 17:00:52.146000

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced over $7 million has been awarded to projects that co-locate solar and agricultural operations in New York State. Through NYSERDA’s Environmental Research Program, over $2 million was awarded to four projects to demonstrate the potential impacts and benefits of using the same land for renewable energy generation from solar panels and active farming, also known as agrivoltaics. Additionally, a $5 million grant was awarded to Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences to construct agrivoltaics projects at its agricultural experiment stations. Together, the demonstration of and research findings gained from these projects will support a broader understanding of the costs, benefits, and market potential for agrivoltaics as part of New York State’s clean energy transition and economic growth.

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “We are proud to partner with farmers, developers, and research partners to advance projects that support solar as a resource to produce energy in New York State while sustaining agriculture operations for economic growth. By examining different means of integrating agriculture operations and clean energy siting, we will build our understanding of the costs, benefits and market potential of locating two essential industries in the same space.”

Agriculture is a critically important sector of New York's economy, with over 33,000 farms across approximately 20 percent of the state's land area, or close to 7 million acres. Farmers, many who are struggling, have expressed interest in the potential for solar energy to provide an additional revenue stream to help stabilize farm income and sustain farm operations. The New York State Farmland Protection Working Group , overseen by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM), recommended that the State study co-utilizing land for renewable energy generation and agricultural production with the potential to play an important role in meeting New York State’s future energy and agricultural development needs. These awards demonstrate NYSERDA’s commitment to developing information and tools that support decision-making in communities and engaging property owners who are considering co-utilization opportunities for agriculture and renewable energy generation to help them keep their land and stay in business.

Agrivoltaics Demonstration Awards

The awards support integrating both new or retrofitted solar and farm operations such as those with grazing, forage or specialty crop production. Researchers, solar developers, farmers, non-profit organizations and local governments were eligible to submit proposals that include a solar site design, marketable agricultural commodity, estimates of expected agricultural production and solar generation.

The awarded projects include:

Capital Region

New York Power Authority was awarded $750,000 to develop a 1,200-1,500-kilowatt solar array that can power approximately 230 New York homes per year on close to 14 acres of State University of New York College of Agriculture and Technology at Cobleskill campus in Schoharie County, using elevated panels for cattle grazing in rotation with growing corn, spaced to accommodate traditional harvesting equipment.

Finger Lakes

K&MH Martens Farms was awarded $185,000 to incorporate agrivoltaics into the development of a 300-kilowatt solar array for a microgrid to support an on-site grain processing operation. The project also seeks to use the solar array to maximize shade benefits for grazing dairy cattle, enhance productivity of the soil and extend the growing season for cool-season grasses while using construction processes that protect soil and farmland pasture in Yates County.

Hudson Valley

Lightstar Renewables was awarded over $515,000 for a 3,200-kilowatt solar array to produce electricity to be provided to the grid, which is equivalent to that used by approximately 725 New York homes per year. The construction features wider spacing of solar panels to enable the continuation of hay production and harvest on one to two acres of new vegetable operations in Orange County.

Southern Tier and Western New York

United Agrivoltaics was awarded $750,000 to demonstrate adding pigs, poultry, and specialty crops at existing solar sites in Cortland, Schuyler, Tompkins, and Niagara counties that already produce 15,850 kilowatts of community solar and cover a total of more than 100 acres.

These projects enable NYSERDA and researchers to understand the costs, benefits, and lessons learned related to agrivoltaics and share data that can be used to develop best practices. NYSERDA convenes the New York State Agricultural Technical Working Group (A-TWG), an independent advisory body comprised of farmers and farming stakeholders, solar developers, state agencies and non-governmental organizations, to advise and steer efforts in advancing solar energy development in a responsible way that supports New York State's agricultural operations, lands, farmers and communities. The A-TWG commissioned the report Growing Agrivoltaics in New York State published in 2023 that identified opportunities and constraints associated with the increasing uptake of agrivoltaics projects in New York State. The A-TWG also provides input on the Smart Solar Siting Scorecard which is used to evaluate applications for utility scale solar projects for their avoidance and mitigation of agricultural and forest lands. NYSERDA in ongoing consultation with the AGM and the A-TWG will study the results of the awarded agrivoltaic projects to understand the opportunities and market potential for agrivoltaics in New York State.

$5 Million Agrivoltaics Construction Projects

NYSERDA also announced that it has awarded a $5 million grant to Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) to construct agrivoltaic projects at its Agricultural Experiment Station sites in the Hudson Valley and Finger Lakes. These sites will conduct long term research on the dual-use of solar operations and agriculture practices across a range of growing conditions and crops relevant to state agricultural producers.

CALS Hudson Valley Research Lab, in the hamlet of Highland, will construct an approximately 300-kilowatt solar array on about two acres, above high-density apple orchards. Specialized sensors and controls will enable solar panel manipulation for sun and shading preferences and for crop protection from frost and hail weather events. Electricity produced will be used to power research lab operations and surplus power will be supplied to the local electric grid.

Additionally, CALS will construct an approximately 900-kilowatt solar array on the Cornell University campus in the town of Ithaca, and will utilize a tracking system, on about seven acres. Plantings within the solar array will include traditional annual vegetable, field and perennial forage crops. Designed to mimic conditions in a variety of solar array configurations, the system will enable research across a range of disciplines including plant genetics, soil health, and water management strategies associated with agrivoltaics. Electricity produced from the solar array will provide power to Cornell’s campus electric grid. CALS will also evaluate constructing agrivoltaics at its Cornell Agri-Tech research farm in the city of Geneva.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Agrivoltaics projects balance the need for additional renewable energy capacity and the preservation of arable farmland. Farmers are the backbone of New York’s rural communities, and funding support for projects like these is important as we aim to strengthen our understanding of this innovative technology that can enhance agricultural productivity while contributing to the energy diversity of our state’s grid.”

State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “There is a real opportunity here before us as we work to support our farmers while furthering our State’s clean, renewable energy agenda. These projects will help us gain a better understanding of how a farm business and solar can co-locate and allow us to learn best practices along the way to ensure agrivoltaics are a beneficial option for our farmers moving into the future. We look forward to seeing these innovative projects and accompanying research across the State take shape.”

SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said, “SUNY applauds this investment by Governor Hochul and NYSERDA to move forward on our state’s ambitious clean energy and sustainability goals, and to open up additional sources of income for farmers by incorporating technology into agricultural operations. We are especially pleased that SUNY’s Cornell College of Agriculture and Lifestyle Sciences will play a key role in this initiative, with the generous support of $5 million funding, as well as SUNY Cobleskill’s partnership with NYPA to help support the power needs from solar arrays on the campus’ property.”

Senator Kevin Parker, Chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Telecommunications, said, ""In the face of gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, I am proud that New York continues to lead by example when it comes to building a sustainable and equitable clean energy future. While others debate, we deliver. I commend NYSERDA for their steadfast commitment to innovation and their ability to keep moving this state forward investing in our farmers, our environment, and our economy. These projects prove that even in challenging times, New Yorkers rise to the occasion, working together to turn bold ideas into real progress. That’s what leadership looks like.""

Senator Michelle Hinchey, Chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, said, “Agrivoltaics gives us hope as we confront growing challenges to our food supply and energy future, and we’re thrilled that the Hudson Valley—one of our country’s most important agricultural regions—is leading the way on this innovative solution. This major investment in the Hudson Valley Research Laboratory, and other projects across New York, will pioneer the research and science-backed guidance we’ve been advocating for to co-produce food and clean energy on the same land. Congratulations to all awardees, and thank you for keeping New York at the forefront of sustainable innovation.”

Senator Peter Harckham, Chair of the Senate Committee on Environmental Conservation, said, “The use of agricultural land for solar energy projects is not a false choice, as their co-use now helps keep many family farms in operation statewide and also lowers electricity costs for ratepayers. NYSERDA’s newly announced investments in agrivoltaics demonstration projects around New York stand as forward-thinking efforts toward a shared sustainable future.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett, Chair of the Assembly Energy Committee, said, “As Chair of the Assembly’s Energy Committee, and a member of the Agriculture Committee, I have been a longtime advocate for agrivoltaics. Our state has world class soils which have fed New York families for generations and agrivoltaics enables farms to keep growing food while concurrently increasing our renewable energy production. These newly funded demonstration projects push the envelope to expand our understanding of what agrivoltaics can do, and I thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their support of these initiatives.”

Assemblymember Donna Lupardo, Chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee, said, “NYSERDA’s investment in agrivoltaics will dramatically improve our understanding of the potential for dual-use solar on NY farmland. As Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, keeping farmland in production is a top priority, including the co-location of solar arrays with long-established farming commodities. Today’s announcement complements the work we have supported through the Ag & Market budget at Cornell University and will allow other projects to proceed as well. As we navigate NY’s clean energy transition, agrivoltaics could prove to be a viable option for farmers to consider.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick, Chair of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, said, “Agrivoltaics recognizes the importance of both renewable energy and the critical role of our farmers and farmland. This significant environmental and farm investment will promote sustainability, increased land efficiency, and enable much needed diversified revenue sources for New York farmers. I'm equally pleased that the vital work done by institutions of higher education, like Cornell University, is being recognized and supported at a time when the federal government has withdrawn support and denigrated the essential research partnership universities provide.”

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Agrivoltaics will play an important role in New York's agricultural future. Agriculture and solar do not need to compete for land; we can produce a range of crops alongside solar panels, adding more value for farmers. These projects demonstrate the cutting edge of this field and will spur further innovations. We thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for recognizing and encouraging this opportunity as we continue our energy transition.""

American Farmland Trust New York and New Jersey Regional Director Linda Garrett and National Smart Solar Director Ethan Winter said, “American Farmland Trust commends NYSERDA for their substantial investment in agrivoltaics research and demonstration. This funding will advance our understanding of potential for integration of solar energy with agriculture, informing policy makers and communities on beneficial pathways for meeting New York’s ambitious clean energy and regional economic development goals. AFT is a long-time collaborator with New York State and we look forward to engaging the innovators selected for this investment in agrivoltaics.”

Lightstar Chief Strategy Officer Lucy Bullock-Sieger said, “These Lightstar projects represent a shift in what is possible for solar and farmers in New York. This is a new choice that doesn't have to be overly complicated. Let farmers farm and we will start to see how agriculture and solar can work together in concert.""

United Agrivoltaics Owner Caleb Scott said, “At United Agrivoltaics, we see every solar project as more than just clean energy—it’s an opportunity to grow food, strengthen farms, and bring new life to the land. With this support from NYSERDA, we will showcase how farmers and developers can work together to maximize a site’s potential, producing renewable power alongside wholesome local food. Our goal is to share with the world a model that proves solar can serve both our communities and our agricultural future.”

K&MH Farms Owner Klaas Martens said, “Farming is inherently the collection and conversion of sunlight into things that people need. We are excited to test a system that allows us to collect that sunlight both for the production of food and for the production of energy. No farmland is being taken out of production with this project.”

Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Ronald P. Lynch Dean Benjamin Houlton said, “Cornell CALS is proud to partner with NYSERDA to pioneer agrivoltaic research across New York’s diverse agricultural landscapes, including the Hudson Valley and Finger Lakes. These projects reflect our mission to deliver purpose-driven science that explores new possibilities for food and energy production. By studying how solar arrays interact with crops and growing conditions, we will pioneer new tools and technologies to inform optimal siting practices, protect prime farmland, and support dual-use food and energy solutions. It’s a powerful step forward in service of our Land-Grant mission—advancing innovation through collaboration and research, serving the needs of New York’s communities.”

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. NYSERDA conducts policy and analysis-oriented environmental research to provide pertinent information on the impacts and opportunities of clean energy choices and arising energy options. NYSERDA also supports New York State’s farmers in managing their energy use through no-cost technical assistance through the Agriculture Energy Audit Program.

Energy and water requirements for data centers powering AI Data centers supporting AI applications require a considerable amount of electrical power and water for their computer storage and processing.
Number and distribution of data centers It is hard to get complete information on the number of data centers because of the ambiguities in how they are both defined and perceived by the market.
In the future, more interoperability could be built into data centers to ensure more seamless data coordination.
The problem with the narrow geographic scope of data center locations is that it reinforces existing inequities and accelerates the gap between digital “haves” and “have-nots.” Data centers are crucial for future economic development.","Artificial intelligence is the transformative technology of our time. As argued in the Brookings Press book, “Turning Point: Policymaking in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,” it is powering applications in finance, health care, education, transportation, defense, and e-commerce, among other sectors. AI’s ability to process large amounts of information and act independently on that basis is altering communications, service delivery, financial transactions, administrative processing, and a host of other areas.

Undergirding this growing use of AI is the need for state-of-the-art data centers. This paper examines the future of these entities. It examines what they are, their numbers and distribution, the different types of centers, financial investments, barriers to development, workforce impacts, economic implications, and considerations for guiding their future growth. Briefly, we argue for a framework for data centers that addresses challenges such as access to critical minerals, workforce shortages, community benefits, permitting reforms, energy and water needs, electric grid investment, national security considerations, and geographical placement. Improvements in these areas will be crucial to ensuring a smooth transition to a digital economy.

What are data centers?

Data centers host a large number of file servers and networking equipment that can store, process, and analyze text, images, code, and other information sources. Guided by large language models (LLMs) and machine learning, data centers can parse through these materials and act autonomously upon the derived insights. The applications that are hosted at these facilities can summarize text, edit photos or videos, examine data, code software, and perform many administrative and financial tasks in real time. These applications offer tremendous convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness to consumers, businesses, and governments.

“Hyperscale” data centers typically have more than 5,000 file servers within their facilities and can house equipment utilized by many different organizations. With the large-scale growth of generative AI, there is tremendous reliance on data centers that process information quickly and with low latency to enable the use of a wide range of AI services and agents. It is estimated that the generative AI market is accelerating around 40% a year and is projected to increase from $43.9 billion in 2023 to nearly $1 trillion in 2032. This high AI growth rate, generated by skyrocketing digital demand, makes it imperative to expand data centers.

Types of data centers

There are different kinds of data centers. One type is data centers for generative AI, which are based on graphics processing units (GPUs) that can deal with vast amounts of information. These facilities process extraordinary amounts of data in text, numeric, or graphic forms and power LLMs and machine learning. They scour the internet, find logical patterns, summarize information, and act on these insights in real time. AI-directed data centers require high computing power and are energy-intensive. As interest in generative and agentic AI has skyrocketed and major tech companies roll out new AI products, there has been a substantial growth in these types of operations. Data center facilities can be enterprise systems operated on behalf of a specific organization or co-location centers that host the platforms of multiple organizations.

One of the most sensitive developments has been high-security centers for military and intelligence gathering. Governments have substantial security needs and require online platforms that house their most confidential secrets, including information on defense applications, battlefield logistics, foreign adversaries, or domestic terrorists, as well as proprietary systems provided by private firms. Processors need to be super-fast to analyze incoming material and super-secure from hackers, malcontents, and enemies. President Trump’s recently launched AI Action Plan directs the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop new technical standards for government entities.

“Edge centers” are situated close to particular activities they support, in order to reduce the latency of computation and networking. Applications such as autonomous vehicles, stock trading, or manufacturing facilities with widespread use of robots need fast communications. These systems don’t want too much of a lag between a query and its implementation. Human lives may also depend on speed in analyzing certain risks, so these kinds of centers need to be very close to where people are utilizing their services.

Energy and water requirements for data centers powering AI

Data centers supporting AI applications require a considerable amount of electrical power and water for their computer storage and processing. In particular, LLMs and other forms of generative AI need a tremendous amount of power. In 2023, data centers consumed around 4.4% of America’s electrical power, and that percentage is expected to rise substantially in the next years. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, energy growth is likely to increase between 6.7-12% by 2028. Around the world, it is projected that AI’s energy needs could account for as much as 21% of all electricity usage by 2030. According to McKinsey, American data centers will utilize 35 gigawatts of electricity by the end of this decade.

Water is a problem as well. Some data centers consume as much as 500,000 gallons per day, making them a substantial draw on what is a limited resource in many communities. Data centers require a lot of water to cool the buildings and the computers inside. Electronic devices heat up during processing, and when thousands of file servers are grouped in a small area, the cooling needs increase dramatically.

Clean water is in short supply in a number of places. This is especially a challenge in the Rocky Mountain states and on the West Coast. In numerous cities and communities, water rates are rising substantially to deal with short supply and increasing demand. One county in Georgia is raising its rates by 33%, far higher than the usual low single-digit increase, which critics attribute to data center needs. New advances in microfluidics, where coolants are applied directly to chips, may improve our ability to cool semiconductors and make data centers more sustainable and less energy-reliant, but much is still unknown about the efficiency of such advances.

As data centers expand, the question is how to generate the energy and water they need. The bulk of American electricity currently comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas (43%) and coal (16%), followed by wind, solar, and thermal (21% together), and nuclear energy (18%). Diversifying energy sources will be essential to meeting the growing demands of data centers, which cannot operate reliably without significant improvements in U.S. energy production.

Nuclear power appears to be rising as a possible energy source, with AI companies planning to open or reopen new plants in the United States. It offers the advantage of not generating the byproducts of fossil fuel consumption while being available all the time once facilities go online. The Three Mile Island plant suffered a partial meltdown in 1979, but it is planned to reopen in 2028 to power Microsoft’s data centers, provide 3,400 jobs, and generate billions in new tax revenue.

This increase in energy needs is occurring against the backdrop of rollbacks on clean energy sources. One organization estimates there will be 344 gigawatts of lost generating power over the next decade linked to the 2025 federal budget bill. Provisions in the bill, particularly changes to tax credits, undermine the financial viability of solar and wind generators and make it harder for consumers to afford the electricity they generate. At a time of dramatically rising energy needs, it is short-sighted for the Trump administration to cut back on renewable energy sources, especially those that will be needed to operate data centers.

Overall, it is clear that the United States will need a substantial boost to electrical production to meet the increased demand of AI and data centers. Companies may mitigate these needs by developing more efficient cooling, lighting, and semiconductor processors. Greater transparency about their energy and water use would also enable policymakers and researchers to better understand the scope of the challenge and plan for sustainable growth.

Number and distribution of data centers

It is hard to get complete information on the number of data centers because of the ambiguities in how they are both defined and perceived by the market. Since there is no central clearing house regarding the numbers in operation, under construction, or in the planning stage, it is imperative that some type of future dashboard be developed. But according to the available data shown below, therearenow an estimated11,800 data centers around the world, powering AI and the digital economy. The United States leads the world in the number of centers as of June 2025, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and France.Around two-thirds of existing data centersare located in the United States, China, or Europe, and only a small number are foundin Africa, Latin America, India, or other regions in the Global South.As is outlined later in the paper, geographic inequities will be crucial in assessing the global impact of data centers.

Table 2 breaks down data center numbers by U.S. state, based on two different sources: DataCenterMap.com and Aterio. As with the global estimates, the overall numbers vary considerably depending on how data centers are defined, the stage of construction and operations, and the time period being covered. Some inventories appear to include small-scale centers, while others stick to larger facilities.

The state of Virginia has the largest number of data centers, followed by Texas and California. Northern Virginia has emerged as the “Silicon Valley” of data centers because of its proximity to federal government agencies, which make extensive use of data storage and processing, in addition to the availability of land, energy, and water sources that support data center operations.

Table 2 also makes clear that the number of newly announced data centers continues to grow. States and localities are actively competing to attract these facilities in pursuit of economic growth.Several states view data centers as essential to establishing themselves as digital hubs for AI and other emerging technologies.

Copper, steel, and aluminum requirements

Some of the most important barriers to data center expansion involve the critical components used for their construction and deployment. These facilities need a considerable amount of copper, steel, and aluminum for the building and equipment, as well as semiconductors, electronics, fiberoptics, and wiring for file servers, storage devices, and networking equipment.

President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on many commodities has dramatically raised the price tag of data centers. This year, the administration imposed tariffs of 50% on copper and raised rates from 25 to 50% on steel and aluminum. These measures dramatically increase the construction and operating costs for data centers.

The costs of semiconductors and electronic equipment imported into the U.S. have also increased by 25%. These increases are meant to boost domestic production and reduce trade deficits with major trading partners. This could eventually happen, but it is hard to construct new facilities and redirect supply chains in a short period of time, especially simultaneously with the expansion of data centers. While tariff negotiations with individual countries continue, the uncertainties associated with this policy remain a drag on data center construction in the United States.

One worrisome policy concern is that while President Trump’s AI Action Plan prioritizes data center construction, his approach to tariffs makes this effort far more expensive. Alternative U.S. suppliers that could reduce costs are also limited, highlighting the inconsistencies between AI national goals and policy implementation. If the United States is to sustain its global leadership in AI, any barriers to data center development (whether stemming from trade policy or supply chain) will impact the timing and sustainability of construction. Despite billions in investments, logistical and permitting obstacles continue to delay data center buildout and operations, as discussed later in this paper.

The need for critical minerals

A major limiting factor in semiconductor manufacturing is China’s control over critical minerals needed for their production. Materials such as gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, and molybdenum are vital for many products and are not readily available from domestic sources.

Furthering the problem is that getting mining permits in the U.S. and Europe can take many years, while countries such as Canada, Australia, and China have far shorter timelines. The length of time required for U.S. and European mining permits limits domestic production of semiconductors and electronics and harms the ability to expand data centers. In the U.S., there is a growing urgency to expedite mining permits and justify the domestic expansion and construction of data centers. Without reliable access to prime materials, overbuilding is a possibility, and in the absence of long-term commitments from AI companies, vast amounts of land could become “data center deserts” if cheaper alternatives emerge elsewhere.

Workforce shortages

Data centers will spur labor demand, particularly in construction and engineering, where there might be a groundswell in job opportunities and subcontracts. However, the current workforce simply does not have the necessary supply of technical workers. The Trump administration’s current immigration and deportation policies compound this workforce problem, especially when it comes to the software engineers needed to power data centers. While the lack of homegrown talent could be resolved with workers from other countries, the current administration has moved in the opposite direction, deporting workers and slowing the supply of foreigners coming into the U.S.

There aren’t enough electricians in the U.S. to meet the demand for laying wires and construction workers to build data centers. There are also shortages of construction workers, which typically include a large number of immigrant workers. It has been estimated that roughly 30% of construction workers in the U.S. are immigrants, including some who are undocumented. However, mass deportations limit the growth of data centers by draining the supply of individuals needed to build and wire such facilities. In every sector involved in data center development, from tech to blue-collar and trade, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown works against its stated goals of furthering American leadership in AI and expediting the construction of the data centers supporting it. This approach contradicts an early commitment made to the major AI companies, which expect reciprocity for their support of the broader Trump agenda.

To redress the labor shortages threatening data center expansion, the U.S. should expand its job training and vocational education programs. More flexible licensing of workers in the trades should be encouraged across states; for example, electrician certifications could be made easily transferable, allowing for more geographic mobility of workers with the necessary skills. The U.S. Department of Labor, in coordination with state workforce agencies, could support a temporary or flexible labor initiative tailored to large-scale data center construction. A stronger national commitment to the skilled trades overall would go far toward closing existing workforce gaps.

When workers can be found, housing problems are an additional concern. Housing costs have skyrocketed in many places, and trade workers will need affordable and reasonable accommodations, especially in expensive areas where data centers are concentrated, like Northern Virginia. Some firms already provide mobile homes as temporary housing for these individuals; based on the expeditious and lofty agenda to build data centers, this could be a viable option.

Finally, most states require inspectors in construction with the duty to keep workers safe. Many places don’t have enough inspectors, slowing down facility development. Even if completed, projects will be stalled until inspectors certify each facility. This is yet another sign that greater coordination between state and local agencies to address these worker shortages is necessary.

Permitting reforms

Obtaining state and local permitting for data centers can take a long time. There are mandated checks for the environment, worker safety, and community well-being. Companies need to get easements and right-of-way privileges to move forward. Some community groups have organized to stop construction. In Northern Virginia, for example, which is home to a sizeable percentage of the world’s data centers, neighbors of adjoining properties have complained in recent years about water shortages, light pollution, and air conditioning noise. Companies need to make sure their sites are safe and clean, and do not endanger community residents.

In its AI Action Plan, the Trump administration is pushing for expedited permitting. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly voiced that current processes are unnecessarily slow and more needs to be done to help companies that want to build technology facilities. The administration is likely to authorize building sites on federal lands under a fast-track system designed to reduce approval times, freeing up unused terrain for large-scale data centers and helping companies move more quickly from permitting to construction.

Another proposal is to exempt data center projects from certain review requirements dictated by the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. Another is to have national permits for data centers as opposed to locally required ones. While these measures might expedite construction, communities may still oppose the projects, especially if residents are not involved from the beginning.

Electric grid and transmission line investment

Among the most critical infrastructure priorities are modernizing transmission lines and ensuring that the electric grid can operate at the required scale, stability, and reliability. With the dramatic increase in electricity needed for data centers, upgrades to the grid will be necessary. It can sometimes take up to 10 years to build the transmission lines that move electricity from region to region. Such transmitters rely upon steel and aluminum, but researchers say materials such as carbon fiber would be lighter and could move larger amounts of electricity. The U.S. Department of Energy intends to upgrade 100,000 miles of new transmission lines this decade, though AI companies are seeking to build many of these data centers on a much shorter timeframe.

With the growth of AI and the design of new materials, there are new tools that will make transmission lines operate more efficiently. AI can improve operations and facilitate a more efficient and sustainable electrical system, preventing loss of power as electricity is moved geographically. In addition, data centers can use “closed cooling systems” that require less water and keep file servers at the temperatures needed for effective operation. These measures will reduce energy costs and keep water and energy demands down.

It is also possible that there will be improved efficiencies in other areas. The Chinese firm DeepSeek, for example, claims it can process tremendous amounts of information with reduced processing power, lower costs, and fewer electrical requirements. A recent peer-reviewed Nature article co-authored by a company leader said DeepSeek’s “reasoning-focused R1 model cost $294,000 to train and used 512 Nvidia H800 chips,” which is a fraction of what most Western models require to operate. While it is not clear how seriously to take such claims, digital technologies have a tradition of becoming more efficient over time; it is possible that design and processing improvements will increase financial and energy sustainability, thereby easing the current pressures facing data centers. AI companies will face many of the same regulatory and state-level hurdles that energy companies do, as was the case in the expansion of 5G technology, when colocation of radios and power generators became a concern. Securing access to modern and resilient power systems may prove one of the stickier points for AI companies.

Data center costs

Many factors go into the costs of data centers, including acquiring land, construction, equipment, labor, heating and cooling, security, power consumption, permitting, operations, and more. Jeff Howell of Encor Advisors has examined this issue in-depth and found that “construction costs for data centers are estimated to average at approximately $9.5 million per megawatt” in the U.S., and once facilities are built, annual operating expenses can range from $50,000 to $100,000 for a small center to $10 to $25 million for a larger facility.

Recent hyperscale data centers that feature thousands of servers were found to cost $1 billion or more to build. They can cover more than a million square feet of land and feature sophisticated computer processing power. In addition to being very expensive, such facilities have huge upfront costs. Many of these expenditures, such as land and construction labor, vary tremendously within the United States, and the same is true for different places around the world. How close installations are to supply chains affects overall costs, as do transportation, logistics, energy, and taxes.

Billions of dollars are currently being invested in AI, cloud computing, and the data centers that power digital applications. Money is flowing from the top tech firms, investment funds, sovereign wealth funds from other countries, financial institutions, industry partnerships, and more. As of 2024, the financial investment required for data centers reached hundreds of billions of dollars, and that number is expected to increase into the trillions by 2030.

Who pays?

Barring major advances in efficiency, the big question is who pays for the increased data center capacity. Right now, ratepayers shoulder some of these costs. Consumer bills have risen in a number of places, fostering resentment about the additional expenses. David Klaus and Mark MacCarthy have argued that since the major technology companies are building data centers and will benefit from their services, they should shoulder more of the costs. They note that the top AI firms have a market value “seven times that of the entire S&P 500 Utility Sector” and therefore have the financial means to pay for the increased electrical power. As an illustration of how this could work, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has proposed that firms operating data centers larger than 1 gigawatt should pay 85% of their electricity costs, up from the current 60%. This change would shift a greater share of financing to technology firms with the capacity to absorb it.

To guard against the consumer backlash over rising electrical bills, several companies are using bonds to finance their long-term investments. Meta, for example, has floated $26 billion in bonds to pay for its new data centers. That allows the company to gain access to capital upfront, with expected revenue gains from AI applications paying for the bonds overtime. That model puts the payment onus more on companies but also assumes the cash flow from new AI revenue will be sufficient to cover bond repayments. If AI accelerates as currently are projected, that should be a relatively safe bet.

Because of the high investment costs, many of the current hyperscale data centers are set up by the large technology firms themselves. According to the scholars at Vanderbilt University, platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform own around two-thirds of the cloud computing market, which serves as the digital infrastructure for the data center sector. Data centers rely upon cloud storage and processing facilities to power AI and other emerging applications, making it essentialy to ensure these markets function efficiently and effectively.

Who benefits?

Consumers, businesses, and government actors will likely benefit if the development of large-scale data centers spurs advancements in AI applications, machine learning, data analytics, and robotics, which in turn could lead to more efficient manufacturing, autonomous transportation systems, the development of new drugs, personalized learning, and much more. There will be faster broadband for ordinary consumers and greater processing power for businesses, governments, and health and educational institutions, especially if the assets of telecommunications companies are effectively leveraged.

Our goal should be to extend the benefits of the digital revolution to everyone, allowing people to share in technological innovation without facing exclusion or harm.

This is where the question of community benefits for residents living near data centers must be made clearer. For example, can local electrical grids be upgraded as part of the broader infrastructure improvements needed to power these facilities? Could irrigation systems be modernized in areas slated for data center construction? Who decides what community investments are made, and how are tech companies and the government working to support local education and workforce development so that residents can access new trade and professional opportunities?

As more data centers are built, multiple stakeholders, spanning AI companies to civil society organizations, should consider the risks of accelerated growth. There should be community surveys to understand people’s concerns and ways for public utility commissions to gather feedback from affected neighbors and incorporate that information into their rate decisions. In other words, communities should not view these buildings as isolated entities, but rather as valued assets that bridge local dynamics with global concerns, as well as an opportunity for local development.

Job impact

One area of community benefit that might be less promising is job creation. Even in large-scale centers, construction jobs often total around 1,500 skilled trade workers and 100 operational jobs. Since centers largely consist of file servers and networking equipment, it does not take a lot of employees to staff them. Hyperscale data centers may comprise a million square feet of space and cost a billion dollars to build, but they are not likely to create a large number of jobs outside of construction, which is why other community benefits may be more salient for regions expanding their data center footprint.

Climate and environmental risks

Natural disasters are major threats to data centers. The prevalence of U.S. data centers in places such as Texas, California, and Virginia makes them susceptible to hurricanes in the Southeast, floods in Texas and Virginia, and earthquakes along the West Coast.

As climate change fuels more destructive floods and storms, companies must carefully select the construction sites of new data centers. In disaster-prone areas, it is also crucial to build in data and operational redundancy in case particular centers go down due to weather problems.

National security considerations

Increasingly complicated geopolitical dynamics are affecting data centers. Shifting alliances and the polarization of global relations alter the United States’ risk profile. Competition with China has intensified, and so have concerns about national defense, cybersecurity, and international competitiveness. Decisions about where to build data centers carry national security implications, raising questions about the nature of a host nation’s relationship with the United States and its level of democratic governance. Careful deliberation about these subjects is necessary, as the implications on intelligence gathering and defense are significant.

On the hardware side, the Biden administration dealt with some possible security threats by limiting chip exports to adversarial countries. It imposed controls on the kind and sophistication of semiconductors that American firms could sell to Chinese entities, for example. It invested in domestic manufacturing capabilities through the CHIPS and Science Act, in order to boost American capabilities and make sure U.S. companies had access to chips in case of any disruptions in production in Taiwan and South Korea, where the most advanced chips are made.

Trump has altered that strategy in two ways. He has weakened support for CHIPS Act funding and loosened restrictions on chip sales to China. The administration’s argument is that it is better to have foreign competitors reliant on American products than for them to develop their own domestic capabilities. The belief is that these actions will protect American security, while still maintaining export markets to China and elsewhere.

Data portability

It is important for organizations to avoid data center “lock-in” and have the means to move their information and models from platform to platform. While this was a problem in the early days of some social media sites, companies can now export their data and switch to another platform if they choose.

There should be a similar mechanism for convenient data migration so that individuals and organizations are not locked into individual sites with limited migration options. Both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) give people control over their own data and mandate the data portability rights of any individual or organization. This requirement should be extended throughout the U.S. to give people more choices and greater control over their personal information and applications. In the future, more interoperability could be built into data centers to ensure more seamless data coordination.

Europe's distinctive challenges

Europe faces some distinctive challenges in building out data centers, owing to the inadequacy of its current power grid, permitting obstacles, and poor access to capital in order to scale its businesses.

It is expensive to build data centers in many European nations. There are high land costs, cumbersome permitting procedures, high labor and tax costs, and infrastructure development barriers.Similar to the U.S., the members of the European Union must address these obstacles and ensure their businesses have access to the data centers that will power the AI economy.

In general, the European Union has been slow to overcome barriers to data center development and is building these facilities at a far slower rate than the United States. A similar challenge could emerge domestically if U.S. states diverge in how they support data center construction. However, as Table 2 indicates, state-level approaches in the United States have so far remained consistent, enabling effective coordination with federal initiatives to advance these projects.

Investing in the US hinterland and Global South

Most data centers now reside in American states on the East or West coasts or in developed countries that already have ample financial resources. There is a real risk that the U.S. hinterland will be left behind, as well as the Global South, including substantial parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Table 1, for example, shows that there are no African countries with a substantial number of data centers, and the only Global South nations among the top 16 places were Brazil and Mexico.

The problem with the narrow geographic scope of data center locations is that it reinforces existing inequities and accelerates the gap between digital “haves” and “have-nots.” Data centers are crucial for future economic development. It will be hard for nations to be competitive if they do not have their own data centers or if their AI applications lag due to insufficient infrastructure. We need a geographical distribution of data centers that promotes economic growth in the Global South and enables AI for the public good around the world.

To deal with equity issues, Daniel Goetzel of Harvard University has discussed “AI economic zones” as ways to diversify the geography of AI and data centers. The idea is that cities could establish areas similar to urban economic zones where public and private investment could facilitate technology developments and make it easier for those without much access to capital to develop their ideas. Similar approaches may work globally through the World Bank or other international development agencies.

In summary, several obstacles and barriers must be addressed to enable data centers—and, by extension, AI applications—to reach their full potential and support economic flourishing. Challenges involving critical minerals components, workforce shortages, permitting reforms, energy and water needs, electric grid investment, national security, and geographical distribution are allcritically important. Improvements in all these areas will be crucial to the international competitiveness and economic prosperity of the United States.This paper is part of a broader research effort to monitor these and other emerging areas and track community benefits and risks, while measuring progress toward national and international goals.

That includes when it might bring a cheaper EV to our shores, like the newly revealed Honda 0 α.
While the EV strategy is getting admittedly ""difficult,"" according to Mibe, the company will instead try to grow its hybrid business.
""For the time being, we will base our business on hybrid vehicles, and then make decisions about battery EVs,"" Mibe said.
Like so many other things in Honda's world right now, Mibe says it might come along in 2030 or later.","Like every other automaker, Honda is having a bit of a tough time navigating what to do with its electric vehicle plans. During a sit-down with media members ahead of the Japan Mobility Show, CEO Toshihiro Mibe talked at length about the various issues Honda is now facing in this area, thanks to changes to the industry implemented by President Trump and his administration. One of the most notable, of course, is the fact that he killed off the $7,500 vehicle tax credit, and it's forcing Honda to rethink its EV timeline. That includes when it might bring a cheaper EV to our shores, like the newly revealed Honda 0 α.

""With the Trump administration in place, we have the sense that EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years or so into the further future,"" Mibe said through a translator. ""So, if we think about whether do we have to really come up with an affordable EV right away, we get the feeling not really.""

Full Disclosure: Honda paid for my flights, food and hotels while I was in Japan.

Now, Honda is looking toward 2030 as a new inflection point for whether or not it'll begin to consider bringing cheaper EVs to our shores. At that point, Trump will (theoretically) be out of office, and the company will have a better understanding of what U.S. politics and policies are surrounding EVs. It's also looking toward the results of the election held on November 4 of this year to see where things may be headed, but until the end of the decade, we're going to have to make do with the more expensive 0 Series Saloon and SUV. Of course, we don't have pricing for those vehicles yet, but I don't expect them to be comparable to the Accord and CR-V.

""We are, of course, aware that affordable EVs are important for the U.S. market as well. So, in the past, going back several years, we have had a history where we have considered affordable EVs together with GM,"" Mibe said. ""However, when it comes to bringing down the cost of EVs considerably, we need to think about the battery strategy, so unless the battery cost is significantly lower, the total cost of the EV cannot be reduced significantly. That's the reality.""

While the EV strategy is getting admittedly ""difficult,"" according to Mibe, the company will instead try to grow its hybrid business. In 2027, Honda plans to launch a revamped hybrid drivetrain that will be more powerful and efficient than the one currently on sale, and it should bring production costs down about 20%. To help with tariffs, Honda is also planning to increase the amount of U.S.-made content within its hybrids.

""For the time being, we will base our business on hybrid vehicles, and then make decisions about battery EVs,"" Mibe said. At a different point during the sit-down, Mibe talked about decades far in the future, like 2040 or 2050, when electrification would have to ""move faster."" It sure sounds like Honda isn't planning for the total EV revolution to come anytime soon.

In the nearer future, Mibe says hybrid volume will continue to increase through 2030. Right now, Honda sells about 800,000 hybrids per year. The goal is to get that number over 2 million by 2030.

Still, none of this means Honda is changing its plans for the 0 Series lineup. When asked if it is considering offering its flagship EVs with hybrid powertrains, Mibe quickly dismissed the idea, saying the 0 Series was specifically designed as an EV platform, so there's no plan to add any sort of hybrid component.

Currently, Honda has shown three different 0 Series models, and because Honda believes the 0 α Prototype is too small and too cheap to come here, it leaves me wanting a third car in the U.S. lineup. Well, while Mibe wouldn't go so far as to confirm a larger 0 Series SUV, he did say the automaker was doing research and development on the next generation of EVs on a different platform, and perhaps one of those could be a large SUV.

""We will want to come up with a full kind of platform product lineup. We do have plans to come up with those,"" Mibe said. ""However, it won't be soon that we come up with a larger EV."" Like so many other things in Honda's world right now, Mibe says it might come along in 2030 or later.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/hondas-ev-plans-have-been-pushed-back-maybe-five-years-by-trumps-policies/l-intro-1762292881.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 13:08:29.653741

Deep Green designs and operates ultra-efficient, high-density data centers that capture and reuse the heat they produce with negligible water use. The company will partner with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (BWL) to supply free, carbon-neutral heat directly into BWL’s hot water system, cutting carbon emissions and creating lasting community benefits.

Benefits the Lansing community can expect from this development include:

A $120+ million capital investment generating $1 million in additional annual revenue to the city from its partnership with the BWL, as well as significant property tax revenue.

Delivering over $1.1 million in annual natural gas savings to the BWL through reduced demand, equivalent to 5,000 homes and more than 310,000 MCF.

Reducing carbon emissions through recycled heat at a rate equivalent to removing 3,000 cars from the road each year.

Creating good-paying union and high-tech jobs during construction (35+ jobs) and operations (15+ jobs) that drive long-term economic impact.

Supporting local nonprofits and charities with a contribution of $6,000 per MW of contracted data center usage, up to $120,000 annually, with portions going to programs like Pennies for Power, which supports families struggling to pay their utility bill.

“Our mission is to accelerate the decarbonization of heat for the benefit of people and the planet,” said Mark Lee, chief executive officer of Deep Green. “By capturing and reusing heat that would otherwise be wasted, this project transforms Lansing’s energy landscape, turning technology into a local sustainability solution. We’re proud to partner with the city of Lansing and the Board of Water & Light to make this vision a reality.”

The facility will have a negligible impact on water use thanks to a closed-loop cooling system with hyper-efficient performance and near-silent operation. Deep Green also plans to design the site to integrate seamlessly into Lansing’s downtown environment, with an emphasis on safety, aesthetics and community collaboration.

“Economic development and repurposing surface parking lots continues to be a priority. Deep Green’s proposal to develop and better utilize these city lots will provide not only urban infill and density, but will also be a major investment and dynamic innovation in our downtown,” said Lansing Mayor Andy Schor. “This project will generate more than $1 million in additional revenue per year for Lansing, which could be used for so many city needs - from police officers and fire fighters, to corridor improvement and assistance to those that need social services. At the same time, it will meet sustainability goals while reducing future utility rate increases. This unique project will strengthen our local economy, support good-paying jobs, and move us closer to a cleaner, more resilient high-tech future.”

For Lansing BWL General Manager Dick Peffley, the project is an ideal partnership.

“Working with Deep Green allows us to take another big step forward in cutting carbon emissions and reducing natural gas use for our hot water system, which will minimize future rate increases for those customers, and also increase our return on equity to the Lansing community,” said Peffley. “At the same time, we’re able to support attracting a business that is truly the foundation of our region’s high-tech economy.”

Deep Green’s Lansing data center will initially operate within the BWL’s existing generation capacity, eventually transitioning to new, cutting-edge technology on-site, ensuring reliable, efficient service without adding costs to current customers. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2026, provided that final approvals are secured from local and state partners.",https://www.lbwl.com/themes/bwl/images/social-image--logo-square.png,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:23.123649

“In the final days of the Biden-Harris Administration, the EPA put their far-left allies ahead of the American people, giving away Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants worth nearly $30 billion to recipients who were not equipped to receive such large amounts of funding,” said Chairmen Guthrie, Joyce, and Palmer. “By requesting documentation about this grant process from the EPA, Republicans on the Committee on Energy and Commerce are continuing our work to root out waste, fraud, and abuse while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

This letter follows requests sent to eight nonprofits who were awarded more than $20 billion earlier this year through the GGRF.

Key excerpt from the letter:

“The Committee finds the potential for financial mismanagement particularly worrisome, as some of the grantees’ previous revenues were only a small fraction of the GGRF funds they received, which raises questions about whether the grant recipients can adequately manage grant amounts that are significantly larger than their previously documented revenue.”

“The Committee seeks to ensure that the federal government is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and to continue supporting EPA’s efforts in combatting waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF program. To assist with the Subcommittee’s investigation of GGRF and support the Administration’s efforts, the Committee requests the following documents no later than November 19, 2025:

The complete grant file for the three NCIF grantees and the five CCIA grantees, including the application submitted by the organization with all supporting documentation and appendices, any additional information requested by EPA, and any memos on changes to the grant terms and conditions.

Background:

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create and implement a $27 billion GGRF program. Of this appropriation, $20 billion was awarded to just eight grant recipients; with $14 billion awarded to three grant recipients under the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program and $6 billion awarded to five grant recipients under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program.

Governors-elect and current Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) made energy affordability a centerpiece of their campaigns in two seminal off-year elections. The cost of living continued to be a top-of-mind issue for the public, according to recent polling in both Virginia and New Jersey. This was an especially salient concern in both states, as residential customers saw the average price of electricity increase by nearly 13 percent in Virginia and by nearly 21 percent in New Jersey, compared with energy bills the prior summer. This is due in part to soaring fuel costs and the need for grid upgrades to keep up with both an increasing number of extreme weather events and new artificial intelligence data centers. These factors are causing cost problems across the country, but the issue came into the spotlight in these two key states.

Energy affordability and utility costs also featured heavily online and in campaign messaging. According to AdImpact, Republicans devoted nearly 30 percent of all ad spending in the New Jersey gubernatorial race to energy and climate issues, while Democrats spent nearly 26 percent. Additionally, analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that, throughout 2025, progressive social media pages routinely outperformed conservative ones in terms of engagement on posts about rising energy costs.

As energy costs have surged, voters are seeking leaders with clear plans to lower bills in the short term while securing long-term stability and clean, affordable energy. In contrast, the Trump administration is only making energy costs worse. Since returning to office, the administration has drastically stymied efforts to deploy reliable renewable energy and halted critical infrastructure projects around the country, threatening jobs, grid reliability, and clean air all at once. To date, more than 100 million in canceled or delayed clean energy investments have been lost in Virginia and more than $2.6 billion in clean energy investment and nearly 8,000 jobs were put at risk in New Jersey, according to Climate Power. The Republican opponents in the state races also repeated the false choice between climate-oriented policies and affordability, which turned out to be a losing argument with voters.

Policy and messaging

In Virginia, Spanberger framed energy affordability as part of a broader plan to make the state’s economy work for families again. Her “Affordable Virginia Plan” called for addressing utility bills by expanding energy-efficiency programs, modernizing the grid, and ensuring data centers don’t drive up costs for Virginians. She argued that when these actors drive up demand, they should also help fund the infrastructure upgrades that keep the grid reliable. “It is about ensuring that there is a statewide strategy recognizing the trajectory we are on for our energy needs and that Virginia is able to pursue greater independence by generating much more energy to meet the needs of our community now and our communities into the future,” she said.

During the campaign, Spanberger repeatedly warned that the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill would drive up costs for Virginians by cutting federal investments in clean energy. In debates and interviews, she pointed to the administration’s withdrawal of Norfolk, Virginia’s wind project as an example of how these cuts threaten local jobs and stall economic growth.

Following the Trump administration’s lead, Spanberger’s Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, attacked the landmark Virginia Clean Economy Act and committed to staying out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). “The RGGI’s energy tax also made it impossible for Virginia’s natural gas plants to compete with producers in states without an energy tax,” said Earle-Sears, claiming the policy had hurt Virginia’s consumers. Despite this, initial analysis indicated that Virginia’s clean energy sector could support thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment statewide.

Spanberger presented affordable energy not only as a climate policy but as a fairness issue for families already paying more for groceries, gas, and housing. Her approach recognized clean energy as a tool to stabilize prices over time rather than as a competing priority.

As energy costs have surged, voters are seeking leaders with clear plans to lower bills in the short term while securing long-term stability and clean, affordable energy.

In New Jersey, Sherrill placed affordability at the center of her campaign. “I’ll get right to it—our utility bills have gone up by 20% this summer. New Jerseyans are hurting. And I hear it from families all around the state,” said Sherrill. Her campaign focused on reducing household energy costs and improving utility transparency for ratepayers. She proposed declaring a state of emergency on utility costs and freezing rates for one year to give families immediate relief while the state works to accelerate the shift to cleaner, more reliable power—and to hold their utility companies and grid operators accountable. The proposal underscored the view that short-term affordability and long-term energy reform must go hand in hand.

Sherrill also tied rising costs to the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill, calling it an “attack on our economy” that would raise utility prices by hundreds of dollars a year. Throughout the campaign, from solar farm visits to televised debates, she argued that the bill’s cuts to clean energy investments would jeopardize projects, eliminate jobs, and leave New Jersey families paying more.

Sherrill’s Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, advanced proposals that echoed the Trump administration’s calls to dismantle clean energy standards rather than invest in modernizing the grid. Ciattarelli’s fossil fuel-dependent energy plan would have raised energy prices for families in New Jersey by nearly $900 per year, according to a report from Greenline Insights. If elected, Ciattarelli also would have pulled New Jersey out of the RGGI, repealed electric vehicle standards, repealed energy efficiency standards for appliances, and reversed the state’s offshore wind goals.

On the other hand, Sherrill’s message tied affordability to economic growth, arguing that a reliable, modern energy system attracts business investment and creates good-paying jobs. She emphasized that lowering costs and advancing climate goals can happen together when policy is guided by long-term savings and consumer protection.

Together, the Spanberger and Sherrill approaches demonstrated how clean energy policy can be successfully framed through affordability and economic security while keeping sight of long-term climate and clean energy goals.

What policymakers should know

While it remains to be seen how campaign commitments turn into specific policy, other states and the federal government will face similar challenges. The Center for American Progress, in collaboration with the Natural Resources Defense Council, found that residents across 49 states, excluding Hawaii, are facing potential increases in their utility bills—some as high as $60 per month. Across the country, electricity prices have risen at nearly double the rate of inflation over this past year. Energy affordability is a worry for Americans: A recent poll found that electricity bills are a major source of stress for 36 percent of Americans.

Federal policymakers should act to lower energy burdens for Americans while still ensuring a reliable electric grid that meets rising energy demand and resilience needs. Spanberger’s Affordable Virginia Plan states that data centers should pay their fair share of the costs to generate and distribute the electricity they need—and that these costs should not be passed onto other customers. At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should require rates that make data centers pay their fair share.

Residents across 49 states, excluding Hawaii, are facing potential increases in their utility bills—some as high as $60 per month.

In addition, drawing on Sherrill’s call for direct consumer relief in her state of emergency declaration, the federal government should support working families by lowering energy burdens for American households. This could be accomplished through federal funding for local governments to reduce utility costs for their residents or the distribution of relief checks for households. And as Spanberger has emphasized through her focus on community solar and local clean-energy production, the federal government could offer funding to accelerate community choice aggregation to lock in an affordable price for clean electricity for Americans and to provide technical assistance to jurisdictions.

Lastly, as emphasized by both governors-elect in their clean energy proposals, improvements to the electric grid are needed. The electric grid is aging and susceptible to vulnerabilities such as extreme weather and inefficiencies. At the same time, dependence on volatile fossil fuels that continue to rise in price and affect the price of electricity in the market should be decreased. Policymakers must build a resilient and modern electric grid while investing in clean energy sources that are cheap and quick to deploy.

Conclusion

The 2025 gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey revealed a growing truth in American politics: Policies that align clean energy with affordability are politically attractive. Policymakers should commit to short- and long-term solutions that demonstrate to voters that lawmakers will tackle the energy affordability crisis effectively and efficiently, bringing costs down for American families nationwide.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.
“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test.
“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said.
Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.","The United States has quit the deal — twice. President Donald Trump is throttling green energy projects at home and finding allies to help him undermine climate initiatives abroad, while inking trade deals that commit countries to buying more U.S. fossil fuels.

Europe remains on track to meet its climate commitments, but its resolve is wavering, as price-weary voters and the rise of far-right parties raise doubts about how quickly the bloc can deliver its pledge to turn away from fossil fuels.

Paris has helped ingrain climate change awareness in popular culture and policy, led countries and companies to pledge to cut their carbon pollution to zero and helped steer a wave of investments into clean energy. Scientists say it appears to have lessened the odds of the most catastrophic levels of warming.

On the downside, oil and gas production hasn’t yet peaked, and climate pollution and temperatures are still rising — with the latter just tenths of a degree from the tipping point agreed in Paris. But the costs of green energy have fallen so much that, in most parts of the world, it’s the cheapest form of power and is being installed at rates unthinkable 10 years ago.

World leaders and diplomats who are in Brazil starting this week for the United Nations’ annual climate talks will face a test to stand up for Paris in the face of Trump’s opposition while highlighting that its goals are both necessary and beneficial.

The summit in the Amazonian port city of Belém was supposed to be the place where rich and poor countries would celebrate their progress and commit themselves to ever-sharper cuts in greenhouse gas pollution.

Instead, U.S. contempt for global climate efforts and a muddled message from Europe are adding headwinds to a moment that is far more turbulent than the one in which the Paris Agreement was adopted.

Some climate veterans are still optimists — to a point.

“I think that the basic architecture is resistant to Trump’s destruction,” said John Podesta, chair of the board of the liberal Center for American Progress, who coordinated climate policy under Obama and former President Joe Biden. But that resistance could wilt if the U.S. stays outside the agreement, depriving the climate movement of American leadership and support, he said.

“If all that’s gone, and it’s gone for a long time, I don’t know whether the structure holds together,” Podesta added.

Other climate diplomats say the cooperative spirit of 2015 would be hard to recreate now, which is why acting on Paris is so essential.

“If we had to renegotiate Paris today, we’d never get the agreement that we had 10 years ago,” said Rachel Kyte, the United Kingdom’s special climate representative.

“But we can also look to these extraordinary data points, which show that the direction of travel is very clear,” she said, referring to growth of clean energy. “And most people who protect where their money is going to be are interested in that direction of travel.”

The Paris paradox

One thing that hasn’t faded is the business case for clean energy. If anything, the economic drivers behind the investments that Paris helped unleash have surpassed even what the Paris deal’s authors anticipated.

But the political will to keep countries driving forward has stalled in some places as the United States — the world’s largest economy, sole military superpower and historically biggest climate polluter — attacks its very foundation.

Trump’s attempts to undermine the agreement, summed up by the 2017 White House slogan “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” has affected European ambitions as well, French climate diplomat Laurence Tubiana told reporters late last month.

“I have never seen such aggressivity against national climate policy all over because of the U.S.,” said Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement. “So we are really confronted with an ideological battle, a cultural battle, where climate is in that package the U.S. government wants to defeat.”

The White House said Trump is focused on developing U.S. oil and engaging with world leaders on energy issues, rather than what it dubs the “green new scam.” The U.S. will not send high-level representatives to COP30.

“The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda,” said Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Trump is not the only challenge facing Paris, of course.

Even under Obama, the U.S. insisted that the Paris climate pollution targets had to be nonbinding, avoiding the need for a Senate ratification vote that would most likely fail.

But unlike previous climate pacts that the U.S. had declined to join, all countries — including, most notably, China — would have to submit a pollution-cutting plan. The accord left it up to the governments themselves to carry out their own pledges and to push laggards to do better. An unusual confluence of political winds helped drive the bargaining.

Obama, who was staking part of his legacy on getting a global climate agreement, had spent the year leading up to Paris negotiating a separate deal with China in which both countries committed to cutting their world-leading pollution.

France, the host of the Paris talks, was also determined to strike a worldwide pact.

In the year that followed, more than 160 countries submitted their initial plans to tackle climate change domestically and began working to finish the rules that would undergird the agreement.

“The Paris Agreement isn’t a machine that churns out ambition. It basically reflects back to us the level of ambition that we have agreed to ... and suggests what else is needed to get back on track,” said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and a negotiator for the United Kingdom during the Paris talks. “Whether countries do that or not, it’s essentially then a matter for them.”

Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former environment minister and a lead negotiator of the Paris Agreement’s carbon crediting mechanism, called the deal an “incredible feat” — but not a self-executing one.

“The problem is now it’s really up to countries as well as cities, regions, companies and financial institutions to act,” she said. “It’s not a treaty thing anymore — it’s now, ‘Do the work.’”

When green turns gray

Signs of discord are not hard to find around the globe.

China is tightening its grip on clean energy manufacturing and exports, ensuring more countries have access to low-cost renewables, but creating tensions in places that also want to benefit from jobs and revenue from making those goods and fear depending too much on one country.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former United Nations climate envoy, eliminated his country’s consumer carbon tax and is planning to tap more natural gas to toughen economic defenses against the United States.

The European Union spent the past five years developing a vast web of green regulations and sectoral measures, and the bloc estimates that it’s roughly on track to meet those goals. But many of the EU’s 27 governments — under pressure from the rising far right, high energy prices, the decline of traditional industry and Russia’s war against Ukraine — are now demanding that the EU reevaluate many of those policies.

Still, views within the bloc diverge sharply, with some pushing for small tweaks and others for rolling back large swaths of legislation.

“Europe must remain a continent of consistency,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after a meeting of EU leaders in October. “It must step up on competitiveness, but it must not give up on its [climate] goals.”

Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, in contrast, said after the same meeting that he felt vindicated about his country’s long-standing opposition to the EU’s green agenda: “In most European capitals, people today think differently about these exaggerated European climate ambitions.”

Worldwide, most countries have not submitted their latest carbon-cutting plans to the United Nations. While the plans that governments have announced mostly expand on their previous ones, they still make only modest reductions against what is needed to limit Earth’s warming since the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Exceeding that threshold, scientists say, would lead to more lives lost and physical and economic damage that would be ever harder to recover from with each tenth of a degree of additional warming.

The U.N.’s latest report showing the gap between countries’ new pledges and the Paris targets found that the world is on track for between 2.3 and 2.5 degrees of warming, a marginal difference from plans submitted in 2020 that is largely canceled out when the U.S. pledge is omitted. Policies in place now are pointing toward 2.8 degrees of warming.

“We need unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions now in an ever-compressing timeframe and amid a challenging geopolitical context,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

But doing so also makes sense, she added. “This where the market is showing that these kind of investments in smart, clean and green is actually driving jobs and opportunities. This is where the future lies.”

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a video message Tuesday that overshooting the 1.5-degrees target of Paris was now inevitable in the coming years imploring leaders to rapidly roll out renewables and stop expanding oil, gas and coal to ensure that overshoot was short-lived.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.

Greenhouse gas pollution hasn’t fallen, and action has flat lined even as climate-related disasters have increased.

“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test. Can this agreement move forward under the weight of all of these challenges?” Hare asked. “If it can’t do that, governments are going to be asking about the benefits of it, frankly.”

That doesn’t mean all is lost.

In 2015, the world was headed for around 4 degrees Celsius of warming, an amount that researchers say would have been devastating for much of the planet. Today, that projection is roughly a degree Celsius lower.

“I think a lot of us in Paris were very dubious at the time that we would ever limit warming to 1.5,” said Elliot Diringer, a former climate official who led the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’ international program during the Paris talks.

“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “I think the answer is yes. Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”

Green technology defying expectations

In addition, the adoption of clean energy technology has moved even faster than projected — sparking what one climate veteran has called a shift in global climate politics.

“We are no longer in a world in which only climate politics has a leading role and a substantial role, but increasingly, climate economics,” said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015. “Yes, politics is important; no longer as important as it was 10 years ago.”

Annual solar deployment globally is 15 times greater than the International Energy Agency predicted in 2015, according to a recent analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a U.K. nonprofit.

Renewables now account for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added globally every year, BloombergNEF reported. China is deploying record amounts of renewables and lowering costs for countries such as Brazil and Pakistan, which has seen solar installations skyrocket.

Even in the United States, where Trump repealed many of Biden’s tax breaks and other incentives, BloombergNEF predicts that power companies will continue to deploy green sources, in large part because they’re often the fastest source of new electricity.

Costs for wind and batteries and falling, too. Electric vehicle sales are soaring in many countries, thanks in large part to the huge number of inexpensive vehicles being pumped out by China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV-maker.

Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.

“Today, you can actually talk about deploying clean energy technologies just because of their cost competitiveness and ability to lower energy system costs,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the research institution Energy Innovation. “You don’t actually even have to say ‘climate’ for a lot of them, and that just wasn’t true 10 years ago.”

The economic trends of the past decade have been striking, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy who negotiated the Paris Agreement.

“Paris is something that was seen all over the world, seen by other countries, seen in boardrooms, as the first time in more than 20 years when you finally got heads of government saying, ‘Yes, let’s do this,’” he said. “And that’s not the only reason why there was tremendous technological development, but it sure didn’t hurt.”

Still, limits exist to how far businesses can take the clean energy transition on their own.

“You need government intervention of some kind, whether that’s a stick or a carrot, to push the economy towards a low-carbon trajectory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “If governments press the brakes on climate action or seriously start to soft pedal, then it does have a limiting effect.”

Brazil, the host of COP30, says it wants to demonstrate that multilateralism still works and is relevant to peoples’ lives and capable of addressing the climate impacts communities around the world are facing.

But the goal of this year’s talks might be even more straightforward, said Guilanpour, the former negotiator.

“If we come out of COP30 demonstrating that the Paris Agreement is alive and functioning,” he said, “I think in the current context, that is pretty newsworthy of itself.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F2f%2F05%2F0e5a211d4a9aa51b3c6077b4d94c%2Ftrump-climate-paris-agreement-03855.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:37.793805

Climate change is a public health matter, affecting the air we breathe, the food we grow and the transmission of disease as global temperatures continue to rise. Extreme heat, severe storms, air pollution, wildfires and the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases threaten the physical and mental health of communities around the globe.

Some populations are disproportionately affected by the health risks associated with climate change, such as people living with disabilities and chronic illnesses, communities of color, people experiencing homelessness and outdoor workers.

Awards are presented in three categories: to APHA-Affiliated public health associations, an APHA member group and individual APHA members who are championing healthy, sustainable and equitable climate solutions.

The Tennessee Public Health Association was selected for an award for its work to build climate resilience among rural communities, with a specific focus on extreme heat adaptation and flood mitigation strategies. Through grant funding provided by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the Tennessee Public Health Association developed a “train the trainer” curriculum, equipping community leaders with the knowledge of climate’s impacts on health so they could then offer the training to their communities.

TPHA isn’t slowing down either — it’s ramping up its preparedness workshops and expanding its curriculum to include the most up-to-date information on climate projections for the state.

The South Carolina Public Health Association was recognized for its work to address heat and energy challenges in Columbia, South Carolina. Through the Smart Surfaces Project, SCPHA partnered with APHA and the Smart Surfaces Coalition to promote technologies that help cool cities and improve resilience to extreme heat. The association launched a mini-grant program that supported local organizations, students and researchers in implementing or studying Smart Surfaces.

SCPHA’s future plans include continuing its tree planting initiative, aimed at creating cooling green spaces; expanding work with the Gills Creek Watershed Association on creating rain gardens at community libraries; and collaborating with the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services on the “Breathe Better” program, which educates students about the importance of air quality on school campuses.

The Intersectional Council’s Climate Change and Health Topical Group received an award for its focus on collaborative efforts in climate, health and equity, bringing APHA members from across Sections together through monthly meetings, annual webinars and events.

The ISC Climate Change and Health Topical Group is creating a strong network of public health professionals committed to climate action. Its future plans include continuing to hold monthly meetings and organizing a roundtable session and social event at APHA’s 2026 Annual Meeting.

Individual awards went to:

Y. Tony Yang, endowed professor of health policy and associate dean for health policy and population science at George Washington University’s School of Nursing, for making climate change a public health priority through policy leadership, scholarship and a deep focus on equity. In 2024, he was named one of 18 next-generation research leaders for his project “For People, For Planet,” which improves the sustainability of health research in the U.S. and U.K.

Jo Kay Ghosh, director of research and evaluation at Heluna Health, for her outstanding contributions to addressing the health impacts of climate-related disasters such as wildfires, extreme heat, flooding and power outages, with a focus on community preparedness. Ghosh has created accessible public resources, including toolkits and infographics in multiple languages, and has spoken with media outlets to raise awareness about climate-related health risks.

Nate Young, program manager with the Pima County Health Department’s Office of Heat Response and Relief in Arizona, for coordinating a county-wide effort to respond to and protect residents from extreme heat. Young and his team incorporate epidemiological and social vulnerability data, using data analysis to inform decision-making.

While many of these measures aim to strengthen Canada’s long-term competitiveness, they also create new opportunities for investors and small businesses to improve cash flow and lower taxable income.

From accelerated write-offs for equipment purchases to expanded credits for clean-tech manufacturing and R&D, the updated framework rewards companies that reinvest in growth and modernization.

Here’s how investors and entrepreneurs can apply these tax tools to strengthen their financial position and position for future gains.

1. Invest in growth now — and write it off immediately

The new Productivity Super-Deduction announced in the Budget 2025 gives businesses a powerful reason to invest before 2030.

Under this rule, companies can immediately expense the full cost of eligible assets — including machinery, manufacturing equipment and clean-energy systems, instead of depreciating them over several years.

For small business owners, optimal tactics include:

Time major capital purchases before the program phases out

Combine the deduction with provincial grants or green financing for maximum leverage

Consider upgrading production lines or fleet vehicles to clean-energy models — both qualify

Investor insight

Companies that reinvest early will report stronger after-tax profits and higher operating efficiency, especially in manufacturing, logistics and construction sectors. So, watch for firms announcing capital reinvestment plans — it’s a bullish signal that they’re taking advantage of this incentive.

Why it matters: Immediate expensing lowers taxable income in the year of purchase, freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested in operations, staff or technology upgrades.

2. Ride the wave of clean economy investment credits

Budget 2025 cements Canada’s Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits, offering 15% to 60% credits on spending in clean tech, hydrogen, carbon capture and manufacturing of renewable components.

Good tactics for businesses include:

Partner with clean-tech suppliers or retrofit your facilities using qualifying technologies (solar, geothermal, energy storage)

Stack credits by pairing clean-tech equipment investments with the Productivity Super-Deduction

Investor insight

Green infrastructure firms, utilities and clean manufacturing companies stand to benefit. Look for publicly traded companies scaling their decarbonization strategies — their future returns may be partially government-funded.

Why it matters: These credits drastically reduce the effective cost of clean-energy investments — making Canada more competitive with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

3. Tap into critical mineral and manufacturing credits

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) now covers 12 new minerals, expanding opportunities for exploration and extraction. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Credit further boosts producers involved in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, solar panels, and semiconductor components.

For business owners cosider whether or not your company supports this sector (e.g., logistics, engineering, component supply) — and partner early. Government incentives often ripple through the entire value chain.

Insight for small-cap investors

Junior miners exploring nickel, lithium, graphite, or rare earths are poised to benefit

Look for exploration companies with eligible projects under the expanded CMETC

Green-tech manufacturers could see higher valuations as production credits lower costs and speed up scaling

Why it matters: These credits aim to develop a full domestic clean-tech supply chain — from resource extraction to finished products — positioning Canada as a leader in EV and renewable manufacturing.

4. Reclaim R&D spending through the SR&ED Program

The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credit remains one of Canada’s most generous incentives for innovation.

Budget 2025 confirms enhanced refundable credits of 35% on up to $3 million in annual R&D expenditures for small firms.

Tactics for small businesses include:

Track R&D-related labour, materials, and subcontractor costs meticulously — many companies underclaim eligible work

Use the SR&ED refund to reinvest in intellectual property, automation, or scaling production

Investor insight

Tech firms that lean on SR&ED can sustain innovation without excessive dilution or borrowing. Pay attention to management commentary in quarterly reports — firms that regularly claim SR&ED credits often show stronger long-term margins.

5. Accessibility Credits as a Market Opportunity

The Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC) and Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) won’t directly apply to most businesses, but they create a strong consumer market signal: Canadians are spending to retrofit homes for accessibility and aging-in-place.

If you own or operate a firm that operates in the construction, renovation, or healthcare services business, then positioning your products to meet CRA’s eligible renovation list could increase demand and eligibility under these programs — and increase your firm's bottom line.

Investor insight

Companies producing modular ramps, adaptive construction materials or smart-home medical tech are positioned for growth. Investors can look for suppliers or exchange-traded fund (ETFs) targeting senior housing, accessibility technology, or healthcare innovation.

6. Shift from carbon rebates to business incentives

With the Canada Carbon Rebate winding down in 2025, the focus is shifting toward industrial decarbonization and business-led sustainability.

A good tactic for businesses is to audit your energy use — replacing high-emission equipment now can yield compounded savings under both clean-tech and productivity tax programs.

Investor insight

The policy pivot suggests a medium-term opportunity in industrial retrofits, energy auditing, and emissions tracking technology — all positioned for growth as carbon policy shifts toward enterprise responsibility.

Why it matters: Firms that invest early in emissions-reducing technology may now receive direct federal support, rather than consumers getting rebates at the pump.

Bottom line for investors and entrepreneurs

Budget 2025’s tax credits aren’t just fiscal fine print — they’re strategic tools for growth. Small businesses can immediately lower taxable income and fund expansion through targeted deductions and clean-tech incentives.

For investors, the winners will be those companies leveraging these programs to accelerate innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.

In short, Budget 2025 rewards proactive capital allocation — whether that’s a small firm investing in new equipment today, or a savvy investor backing the next generation of Canadian clean-tech leaders tomorrow.",https://media1.money.ca/a/137468/investors-and-small-businesses-budget-2025_social_media_thumbnail_1200x628_v20251104231210.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:15.185351

Energy marketers have often had to weather the whiplash of competing political ideologies, from incentives to promote cleaner energy and regulate traditional energy sources on one side to deregulation efforts on the other. In the face of these debates, renewable propane remains a vibrant, blooming branch on the larger tree that is the propane industry.

Although there is fascinating research being put forward on renewable propane production, from exploring creative biomass fuel sources to tinkering with ways to bring the experimental fuel up to scale, renewable propane faces major questions on the ground.

Can the fuel be scaled? Is there a real market for renewable propane? In a political landscape that oscillates between carbon emissions regulation and deregulation, where does renewable propane belong? And where, exactly, does renewable propane stand right now?

The Current Landscape of Renewable Propane

The Trump administration has explicitly expressed support for and released executive orders that call for increased conventional energy production. The propane industry has welcomed these moves. But what about some of the harder-to-define areas of the energy sector — more “gray” spaces that are occupied by experimental energy sources like biomass fuels? There’s a saying I’ve come to appreciate as I’ve grown older: Follow the money.

To understand the current opportunities for renewable propane, it’s helpful to take stock of the current funding across the energy sector. Here are some of the tangible ways the current administration is investing — and divesting — in renewable propane.

Department of Energy Notice of Funding Opportunity

In December 2024, the Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) announced its intentions to establish a funding opportunity — up to $23 million — for research and development of renewable chemicals and fuels, including renewable propane. The funding opportunity is a rare example of a clean energy initiative that has not been retracted or struck down by the Trump administration.

According to DOE, the notice of funding opportunity “will support BETO’s conversion technologies program area priorities by advancing innovative technology pathways for affordable fuels and products, leveraging renewable resources and generating domestic jobs to accelerate the U.S. bioeconomy.”

Applicants for the funding were required to submit full applications by May 30, with selections taking place in October (selections had not been made at press time). Each research project is eligible to receive up to $2.5 million, granted it meets the following expectations:

ASTM D1835 specifications

Have a system energy consumption of no more than 50% of higher heating value of the finished LPG

Achieve a reduction of net greenhouse gases relative to fossil LPG of at least 70%

It remains uncertain whether the full funding amount will be awarded to applicants and by what standards the current administration will select award recipients.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The Trump administration’s momentous spending bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed by a thin margin and was signed into law July 4. It is likely the largest and most prevalent piece of legislation that will directly impact the energy sector in the near future. Sweeping in nature, the impacts of the bill on the energy sector — and on the propane industry, specifically — will likely only be fully understood and appreciated with time.

Highlights include:

Increased rate of mandatory gas and oil lease sales on federal lands, while eliminating the Biden administration’s requirements for renewable energy leasing

Reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying property

Postponed methane emissions fee that exceeds certain thresholds to the calendar year 2034

Extended the clean fuel tax credit through 2029

Accelerated phase-out periods for various Inflation Reduction Act clean energy programs, including the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, New and Used EV Tax Credit, Clean Electricity Investment and Production Credits and the Alternative Fuel/Refueling Property Credit

To reiterate, it’s likely impossible to assess how OBBBA’s changes to the energy landscape will play out for renewable propane production. While some changes might seem to obstruct or hurt renewable propane production — insofar as the bill implements changes that largely target most renewable and clean energy initiatives — the reality for renewable propane and even conventional propane is likely far more complicated.

For example, while the bill makes a point of targeting electric, solar and wind energy tax incentives, it remains relatively silent when it comes to directly addressing clean fuels. In fact, OBBBA extends the Clean Fuel tax credit through 2029, a tax credit that has benefitted the propane autogas and renewable propane industries, among others.

But to make matters more complicated, actions that appear to directly impact electrification efforts alone might additionally impact the more niche propane and renewable propane markets. OBBBA phases out both the Residential Clean Energy Credit and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. Under the latter, certain propane water heaters qualified for a tax rebate.

OBBBA also phases out the Alternative Fuel/Refueling Property Credit, a program that has benefitted both electric vehicle production and propane autogas production. Besides allowing autogas sites to directly qualify for credits for refueling infrastructure, increased electric vehicle use and a demand for charging stations presents an opportunity for propane and renewable propane manufacturers to step in as a solution — rather than merely a competitor — to the strained demands on the electric grid, especially in remote, rural areas (see BPN’s August 2024 Beyond the Mains column for more information).

That being said, it is nevertheless true that OBBBA seems to largely benefit fossil fuel production. Where the act addresses renewable and clean energy initiatives, it is, for the most part, to phase out such programs. If OBBBA ushers in an overall decline in credit and grant opportunities for renewable research, this raises the question of where renewable propane stands. This is especially the case in light of the other ways the Trump administration has gone about defunding renewable energy.

Miscellaneous Clean Energy Cuts

Amid the flurry of activity that marked President Donald Trump’s first months in office, the DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have announced funding cuts to many clean energy programs. Funding cut announcements include:

$7.56 billion in financial awards for 223 energy projects across states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election

2026 Budget Proposal cuts, including:

$2.5 billion from DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy department

$80 million in Department of Interior renewable energy programs

Cuts EPA grants to nongovernmental organizations

Similar to OBBBA, the main target of these proposed cuts are clean energy projects involving hydrogen, wind, solar and electric energy. Once again, cuts like these raise the question of what incentives will exist for renewable propane development in the future.

Recent cuts in clean energy development have directly impacted ExxonMobil, which was in the process of researching and developing clean hydrogen. Chevron owns and operates one of the major renewable propane programs in the country. In an environment where experimental fuels largely depend on government investment and the powerful infrastructure of established companies, it is unclear the extent to which these cuts will impact the “main players” in the fuel space going forward and their motives to develop fuels like renewable propane.

Why Should Propane People Care?

In light of the generally favorable ways in which the Trump administration is streamlining business permits, increasing land access for fossil fuel companies and potentially decreasing operational costs, why should we care about what’s happening in the clean energy space? There’s a temptation to relegate clean energy concerns to the sidelines — and likely for good reason. Some clean energy spaces may seem, after all, to be in many ways in direct competition with our own.

Most in the propane industry deal with traditional propane sourced from crude oil. In the course of a typical propane industry member’s workday, renewable propane may rarely come up as a topic, and when it does, it may be treated as a hypothetical rather than a tangible product. It makes sense that the push for the deregulation of conventional propane and its related market applications tends to rule the day.

Yet if history has taught us anything, it’s that new technologies and shifting values and concerns tend to bubble up whether we want them to or not. It can’t hurt to be an industry that is primarily curious. As Propane Education & Research Council President Tucker Perkins often says, we need a “wide path” approach to energy, one that appreciates innovation and sees opportunity where it might be tempting to see threats.

In fact, innovation has been at the center of the propane industry ever since the chemist Walter O. Snelling discovered that gases dispersed from gasoline could be liquefied and converted into a new type of fuel: “liquefied” petroleum gas.

Imagine running a hospital emergency department where a critical challenge is staffing. You need the correct number of emergency physicians and nurses available 24/7 to handle unpredictable patient surges. If you overstaff, costs become unsustainable. If you understaff, patients suffer.

Hospitals use historical data and predictive models to forecast staffing needs — they know that Mondays typically see more patients than weekends, that flu season creates predictable surges and that summer brings more trauma cases. Based on these patterns, they create staffing schedules months in advance. But hospitals must also maintain flexibility to handle unexpected events like multi-car accidents or a pandemic outbreak that can overwhelm even the best-laid plans.

This combination of systematic planning and operational flexibility shares similarities with what grid operators face every day as they manage our electricity infrastructure. Instead of patients needing immediate medical care, they’re dealing with millions of homes, businesses and critical facilities that need power exactly when they require it — not a moment too late. Rather than managing healthcare professionals, they’re coordinating a complex network of power plants, renewables and energy storage systems, each with different operating characteristics and availability patterns that must work together to maintain reliable service.

What is ELCC?

This is where effective load carrying capability, or ELCC, becomes indispensable. Much like a hospital forecasts patient volumes during different times of the year, grid operators forecast when they expect the greatest system stress — typically during peak demand periods when electricity usage is highest. They then evaluate how much each power source will contribute during these critical periods and assign each resource a reliability score based on its forecasted availability when the grid needs it most.

Unlike traditional reliability metrics that measure how often a power source comes on over the course of a month or year, ELCC specifically measures its contribution during peak stress periods. This distinction is crucial because the grid’s reliability depends not on total energy production, but on having an adequate supply precisely when demand is highest.

Solar and wind have a much lower ELCC than nuclear or natural gas due to their intermittency and the fact that they can’t be relied upon during peak stress hours (e.g., solar power is unavailable on a cold, dark winter evening). Consider that a 100-MW solar farm might have an ELCC of only 30%, meaning that across the hours with the greatest reliability risk, grid operators forecast an average production of 30 MW. Meanwhile, a 100-MW natural gas plant might have a 75% ELCC, providing 75 MW of dependable capacity during those same critical moments.

Grid operators face a similar planning challenge: baseload power sources like nuclear and fossil fuels provide a high degree of consistent capacity around the clock, while renewables face inherent limitations.

Renewable growth and short-duration energy storage

Driven by economics and speed to deploy, wind and solar capacity are on track to triple by 2030. But due to the intermittency noted above, their value is limited if they are not paired with another resource. Battery energy storage systems, or BESS, provide a solution to the intermittency challenge of renewables, capturing excess renewable energy when generation exceeds demand, and then discharging that stored energy during periods when renewable generation falls short of demand.

Lithium-ion batteries have become the initial workhorses of the energy storage revolution, typically providing four hours or less of storage. Until recently, this has aligned well with peak emergency periods — relatively short but intense surges in late afternoon and early evening when the grid faced its highest stress. As a result, four-hour batteries have had high ELCC values to date.

This high ELCC, combined with falling lithium-ion hardware costs, has driven dramatic growth in battery deployment. U.S. battery storage capacity increased by 66% in 2024, bringing operating capacity to 26 GW, while costs fell 80% over the past decade. Costs are projected to decline further, making battery storage competitive with natural gas peaker plants. Battery storage paired with solar is also one of the most competitive new sources of electricity.

However, the grid is evolving rapidly, and shorter-duration storage resources face challenges ahead.

The case for longer duration energy storage

As more short-duration storage gets deployed, the shape of the grid challenge is changing. Short, sharp demand peaks for a couple of hours have evolved into longer plateaus of sustained high demand relative to renewable generation. This transformation occurs because short-duration batteries effectively lop off the top of demand peaks. What that leaves you with is a scenario where the number of hours that constitute the new peak is longer (i.e., a flat-topped mountain).

Adding to this challenge, the explosive growth in electricity demand — particularly from data centers that require 24/7 power — is creating longer periods of sustained high demand rather than brief peak periods. Grid operators now face 8-12 hour sustained periods of high net demand that extend well beyond what existing four-hour batteries can cover.

The implications for ELCC values are profound and happening faster than many anticipated. The first 5 GW of four-hour storage might achieve 80% to 90% ELCC, but by the time 15 GW is deployed, new installations can drop below 40% ELCC. Essentially, those same four-hour assets become de-rated because they cannot be relied upon to provide power when the grid needs it most over those 8+ hour stretches.

This decline in ELCC isn’t a failure of technology — it’s evidence of success in creating new requirements. The initial batteries solved the original problem so effectively that they revealed the next challenge: the need for longer-duration storage that can adapt as grid conditions continue to evolve.

Longer-duration storage addresses the fundamental need to carry a renewable-powered grid through extended periods of low generation. A typical four-hour battery might handle an evening peak but cannot sustain the system through a day or more of below-average renewable production.

Rather than simply deploying more four-hour batteries, optimal planning requires matching storage durations to the full spectrum of grid needs. In order for a resource to provide the same amount of ELCC, the duration must match the actual length of the high-demand period.

Flexible duration thermal energy storage

The declining ELCC of short-duration batteries creates a planning dilemma for utilities that’s difficult to solve with traditional storage technologies. What if grid conditions change and the optimal duration shifts from 10 hours to 15 hours to 20 hours over time? This creates a classic “Goldilocks problem” where utilities either have to build something now that provides perfect ELCC for the time being but falls short down the road, or they can overbuild a battery that’s providing enough ELCC in 20 years — but that means they’ve spent a lot of money on something that they don’t need quite yet. It’s too much or too little, but never just right.

Flexible duration thermal energy storage can address this problem head-on. Thermal battery systems offer a different approach to energy storage by storing electricity as heat in inexpensive materials, like carbon. Unlike electrochemical batteries that degrade with cycling, these thermal systems can handle thousands of charge-discharge cycles with minimal performance loss.

By separating power conversion from energy storage, storage capacity can be added incrementally at a fraction of the initial cost. The result is a storage system that can grow with changing grid needs. Instead of buying too little or buying too much, the utility can future-proof the capacity value of the battery by adding incremental capacity at a later date.

This flexibility tackles the ELCC challenge directly. For example, if a 10-hour battery starts losing ELCC value as grid conditions change, additional storage hours can be added at just 20% of the installation cost. This scalability responds to the dynamic nature of grid planning, allowing storage assets to grow with evolving needs rather than becoming stranded investments.

The declining ELCC of short-duration batteries isn’t a problem to solve — it’s a signal of successful renewable integration and a roadmap for what comes next. The challenge requires storage systems that can adapt to changing grid conditions while maintaining economic viability.

The broader context is important: every time you build a battery or any other asset, somebody is paying for that. And that somebody is a ratepayer. The solution requires optimizing the technology mix rather than simply building more of the same resources.

We don’t have to choose between renewables and reliability. By understanding ELCC and investing in adaptable storage solutions, we can build a grid that powers our critical infrastructure sustainably for generations, ensuring that when people depend on electricity, the power will always be there. The key is recognizing that successful renewable integration creates new challenges and requires developing storage technologies flexible enough to meet them.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/A_J__TrphjouOtaPTNvS1GbWajnEVDs_lE7BJTggLR4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc19wb3dlcl9saW5lcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-05 13:08:17.101420

My colleagues and I have defended ILUC as a vital safeguard to address land use change from biofuels. I sent countless technical comments, I’ve written technical articles, and helped organize letters from scientists on this topic to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and environmental policymakers in the European Union. But the approach we’ve defended is not working as well as it should, and it is time to think about how to make land use protections stronger.

This week the CARB is holding a workshop to consider the latest science on land use change from biofuels. This is overdue, since the analysis in California’s fuel regulations has not been updated in a decade. Recent analyses find important flaws with the GTAP economic modeling framework CARB used to develop its current ILUC estimates, and an important new analysis from Chen, Sexton and Smith finds that the global growth in vegetable oil-based fuels has accelerated deforestation with very large climate impacts. Despite concerns about land use change, recent actions of the Congress and the Trump administration are poised to dramatically increase consumption of vegetable oil-based fuel in the United States. The bottom line is that land use change remains a very real problem for biofuels.

In addition to the consideration of these scientific and modeling questions, I find myself thinking about lessons learned for policy design. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) framework relies on adjusting lifecycle carbon intensity (CI) scores based on ILUC analysis to send market signals to discourage deforestation. This ILUC accounting framework is complex and controversial, and it has not been universally embraced by other jurisdictions. The challenges are both technical and political. The complex and opaque collection of models required to assign emissions to specific fuels leaves ample opportunity to manipulate the process to get politically motivated results. And the high stakes and political power of the relevant interests mean they can and have shaped the outcomes of the analysis. As a result, ILUC determinations are often made on political rather than technical grounds.

The lesson I take is that the complexity and opacity of the existing ILUC framework are undermining its efficacy as a land use safeguard. Studies like the one from Chen, Sexton and Smith tell us that the expansion of vegetable oil-based fuels from 2002 to 2018 was very harmful, and the most direct way to address this harm is to check further expansion of these fuels. Going forward, directly regulating the amount of vegetable oil or other resources used to make biofuels may be a more effective way to structure a policy safeguard than the current ILUC framework of adjusting CI scores.

Background

On November 6th, CARB is holding a public forum on biofuels and land use change. This workshop is a follow-up to the 2024 amendments to the LCFS. The workshop was called for in a board resolution, issued as part of the process of board approval of the 2024 amendments to the LCFS. The resolution calls for a public forum covering two major topics:

Review the latest science on land use change and relevant models, and

Consider how to mitigate risks of harmful land use change or food market conflicts for future updates to the LCFS.

This workshop will only tackle the first part of the board’s direction, reviewing the latest science on land use change and relevant models. The question of how best to mitigate risks, including potential changes to policy design, will have to wait for another day (hopefully soon). I’m disappointed by this omission, because policy changes are needed to effectively mitigate the harm caused by the massive ongoing expansion of biofuel use.

The LCFS relies on lifecycle analysis to address concerns about land use change

The primary LCFS safeguard to address concerns about land use change is the inclusion of an estimate of land use change emissions (called indirect or induced land use change emissions or ILUC) in the carbon intensity (CI) assigned to crop-based biofuels. When this approach was initially proposed in 2007 by Alex Farrell and Dan Sperling[1], it was offered as a short-term measure until an “internationally accepted methodology for accounting for land use change” could be developed. Unfortunately, no consensus on methodology has been reached, and it appears increasingly unlikely it ever will.

In 2010 CARB convened an expert workgroup, on which I served, which informed updates to CARB’s ILUC calculations that were finalized in 2015. CARB’s ILUC analysis is based on the GTAP model, and a different version of the same model was subsequently used by the Argonne Lab to create an ILUC module of the GREET model, which projects ILUC emissions that are much lower than the original CARB study. The GTAP framework has been criticized for many technical deficiencies, and comparisons with other models suggest the GTAP approach substantially underestimates ILUC emissions.

In 2022, I served on a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that reviewed Current Methods for Life-Cycle Analyses of Low-Carbon Transportation Fuels in the United States. My experience on this committee reinforced that there is not now, nor will there ever be, a consensus approach in the expert community on how to do lifecycle analysis of transportation fuel. One important finding of the committee was that CI scores used for policies like the LCFS combine two dissimilar kinds of lifecycle analysis, one focused on attributing responsibility for emissions to individual actions and actors in the biofuel supply chain (called an attributional analysis), and a second that evaluates the global consequences of a policy or change (called a consequential analysis). The resulting CI score is a hybrid that does not answer any well-defined question. An alternative approach that resolves this methodological problem is to use different types of analysis for different elements of the policy, with a consequential analysis used to shape decisions of fuel producers, and a consequential analysis used to inform safeguards that directly mitigate risks or problems the analysis identifies.

New analysis points to a major problem with vegetable oil-based fuels

Much of the debate since 2008 over land use change has focused on corn ethanol. But for the last decade, most of the growth of biofuel consumption in the US has been from vegetable oil-based biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel. A new analysis by Chen, Sexton and Smith from UC Davis and Berkeley finds that that using vegetable oils for biofuel accelerates tropical deforestation and increases carbon emissions. This new analysis takes a different approach than GTAP, relying more heavily on empirical data to reduce the dependence of the results on assumptions and model structure. They find that the global expansion of bio-based diesel made from vegetable oil has fueled massive deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. The extent of deforestation and associated emissions outweigh any climate benefits from replacing petroleum fuels.

A key finding of the analysis of Chen, Sexton and Smith is that the extent of deforestation is largely independent of which specific source of vegetable oil is used to make biofuel. This is not surprising, because vegetable oils are all close substitutes in the global food market. But this finding is in tension with the structure of ILUC implementation, which assigns differentiated ILUC scores to specific types of feedstock. For example, the LCFS assigns ILUC emissions of 71.4 g CO2e/MJ to palm oil, 29.1 g CO2e/MJ to soybean oil, and 14.5 g CO2e/MJ to canola oil and zero to inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or animal fats like tallow. These different ILUC scores create differentiated incentives that have had a big impact on the fuel market, as biofuel producers supplying California have scoured the globe to secure feedstocks with the lowest CI scores[2].

Not surprisingly, biofuel and vegetable oil producers reject the finding that using any source of vegetable oil has a similar impact on global markets. They argue it is unfair to hold midwestern soybean oil accountable for palm oil related deforestation in Indonesia. They have been successful at persuading federal policymakers to change the parameters of federal biofuel policies in a manner that favors major US crops, first by pressuring regulators to reduce ILUC values assigned to these crops and most recently by excluding consideration of ILUC from federal tax credits and restricting biofuel incentives to domestic fuels and feedstocks[3]. The resulting incentive structure of federal policies could have a big impact on California fuel markets in years to come. The strategies California has used to discourage the use of vegetable oil fuels will become less effective because of these changes in federal policy.

Fixing biofuel policies depends on the federal government, but California can help

The federal government bears the primary responsibility for the global harm caused by US biofuel policies. Federal policy has expanded the use of vegetable oil-based fuels to levels that far exceed the availability of US feedstocks to produce those fuels, with large and counterproductive impacts on global trade and land use. The result is that an increasing share of US biofuels have been coming from imported feedstocks or fuels. The administration wants US biofuel policies to focus on US fuels and feedstocks, but rather than scaling back biofuel mandates in line with domestic feedstock availability, they have proposed enlarging the mandates and layering on incentives for domestic feedstocks that will lead to costly and counterproductive shuffling of feedstocks and fuels.

I’ve called on the Environmental Protection Agency to scale back its biofuel policy proposal in line with a realistic assessment of feedstock availability. I also explained in a recent talk (video and slides) that because biofuels have a bigger impact on agriculture than transportation, biofuel policies should be designed with agriculture in mind. In particular, the ambition of US biofuel policies should be based on a realistic assessment of domestic feedstock availability and safeguards should ensure biofuels don’t exceed this level and expand the footprint of agriculture in the US or around the world.

California can’t fix problems caused by federal policies, but it can provide an essential laboratory for policy innovation, which is even more critical with federal science sidelined by the Trump administration. California’s LCFS model has been adopted by other states and will hopefully someday inform federal fuel policy reform. The LCFS wisely recognizes that shifting to renewable electricity for transportation is vital to phasing out petroleum and encourages all fuel producers to reduce their supply chain emissions. But before the LCFS can be a scalable model for federal fuel policy reform, California needs to grapple with the land use change challenge that has hung over the LCFS since its inception.

Learning from failed experiments, building safeguards that work in the real world

Scientists often learn more from failed experiments than they do from successes. But to learn these lessons one must acknowledge when an experiment has failed. California’s LCFS is an elegant policy that has a lot to recommend it, but its efforts to safeguard against harmful land use change have struggled. ILUC adjustments to CI scores are uncertain, technically complex, and prone to political interference. And with multiple overlapping policies affecting markets, adjustments to CI scores have an indirect and uncertain impact on land use.

The essential question policy makers must answer is how much of the vegetable oil, corn, animal fat, and other resources that can be used to make biofuels should be made available for fuel use. This requires an examination of resource availability, competing uses, impacts on land use, deforestation and food markets. With safeguards in place to avoid excessive diversion of these resources to fuel use, the LCFS can create an incentive structure that supports transportation electrification, encourages all fuel producers to reduce emissions and requires steady progress from the transportation fuel sector as a whole.

The availability of these secondary sources is much lower than vegetable oil on a global scale, and the data on their production and use is limited. But these feedstocks make up a large share of the California bio-based diesel market. The substitution that links primary vegetable oils will also occur with tallow, used cooking oil or inedible corn oil, but not in precisely the same way. These secondary fats and oils are used to make soaps and detergents or as animal feed, and when they are diverted to fuel production, they will be replaced with other resources. Over the last few years, consumption of these feedstocks for biofuel has grown so large that the indirect impacts of their use merit further study.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aerial-palm-oil-plantation-indonesia.gif,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:46.997300

Forty years after boosters began promoting carbon capture and storage (CCS), the technology remains a failure. Yet lawmakers have dedicated more public funds to this scam than ever. They are ignoring carbon capture’s history of waste and fraud — and all the ways that polluters can and do exploit incentives.

CCS technology promises to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from smokestacks or the air and permanently keep it out of the atmosphere. It enables a fantasy where dirty energy can be made clean with the right technology; where we can fight climate change while continuing to drill and burn fossil fuels.

While federal support for renewables plummets under Donald Trump, our leaders are expanding 45Q, a lucrative tax incentive program for the CCS climate scam. Worse, 45Q just got a major bump from Trump’s Big Ugly Bill to incentivize more oil drilling.

Lawmakers are making more funds available to polluters, while failing to guard these funds from exploitation. As our new research shows, this amounts to throwing our taxpayer dollars down oil and gas wells and into fossil fuel execs’ pockets.

Billions of Dollars Spent on CCS With Nothing to Show for It

The federal government has already spent decades and billions of dollars on the carbon capture pipe dream. It began with federal “clean coal” efforts, which aimed to use the technology to reduce coal’s climate harm. From 1984 to 2006, the federal government spent $7 billion developing this technology with nothing to show for it.

The Energy Department was also dumping cash into another fossil fuel technology branded as carbon capture: enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a drilling technique using captured carbon. With EOR, drillers inject CO2 into oil wells to bring the last dregs of oil to the surface.

Like the debunked “bridge fuel” messaging around natural gas, proponents claimed EOR would help develop carbon capture into a real climate solution, without oil production.

This has not come to pass. In fact, almost 90% of CO2 captured in the U.S. is still used for EOR. And this does more harm to the climate than help. In fact, burning the oil produced through EOR emits more CO2 than is injected during the process.

Carbon capture then got another $3.4 billion boost with the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The result? Cost overruns and canceled projects, which have only continued to plague the industry since.

With billions of dollars and forty years of tinkering, carbon capture’s climate impact is laughable. As of September 2023, total U.S. CCS capacity — if run at maximum capacity — could capture only 0.4% of all our emissions. Piling more subsidies onto carbon capture is a waste, especially given the rapidly shrinking timeline we have to downsize emissions and avert climate chaos.

Lack of Oversight Allows Fraud and Abuse to Run Rampant in 45Q

Not only have carbon capture subsidies failed to scale the technology — they’ve also been mismanaged, allowing exploitation to run rampant. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Energy Department’s handling of carbon capture, all the way back to the George W. Bush administration, was riddled with accounting errors. The Department also continued to fund projects that missed targets and violated agreements.

Today, the 45Q program is hidden behind a smokescreen. We don’t even know what specific facilities claim the credit or the maximum funds the federal government will distribute through the program.

Moreover, no single government agency has full access to the data used to implement 45Q. This reduces oversight. Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which administer different parts of 45Q, operate with incomplete knowledge of the projects that recieve the credit.

Furthermore, there’s not enough accountability in how companies report the CO2 they “capture.” To “verify” companies’ captured CO2, the IRS depends on numbers that the companies themselves report to the EPA, without checks from either agency.

All this contributes to the fraud and waste that runs rampant in 45Q. In 2020, the Treasury Department found that companies had improperly claimed nearly $1 billion in 45Q credits. These companies failed to give proof that the CO2 was effectively stored.

How did lawmakers respond? By boosting 45Q tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act.

And now, Trump has further expanded the pie for fossil fuel corporations to get 45Q dollars. His administration is also gutting oversight and clearing the way for more abuse. It has fired government watchdogs for federal agencies and is slashing staff at the EPA and IRS.

45Q Lavishes Big Bucks on Fossil Fuel Facilities With Dubious Climate Benefit

The biggest scandal of 45Q? Many of the dollars for a so-called “climate solution” are awarded to polluters for polluting the same as they always have. Oil drillers and gas processors have used 45Q to claim tax benefits without changing anything about their existing operations.

Crucially, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill provided a huge boost to the 45Q tax credit for enhanced oil recovery, the main use of captured CO2. This has unlocked a potential $210 billion in additional subsidies, just for oil drillers to continue drilling.

The program also rewards natural gas processing facilities for disposing of their waste in the same way they always have. Drilling for methane gas brings up waste that includes CO2; processors have long separated out that CO2 and then injected it underground. By simply reclassifying these injection wells, gas processors can access 45Q dollars. We estimate that now 60% of the reported CO2 captured in the U.S. comes from gas processing facilities.

To make matters worse, CO2 needs to stay underground for thousands of years to benefit the climate, but long-term storage is far from guaranteed. Storage technology is riddled with issues that lead to leaks.

45Q rules require companies to give back credits for leaked CO2 — but this only lasts for four years. Anything that leaks after that? Companies get to keep the money. This gives them no incentive to ensure CO2 stays in the ground long enough to actually help the climate.

We are just paying the fossil fuel industry to pollute, with no climate benefit to show for it.

Congress Must Stop Wasting Money on the CCS Climate Scam

The messaging on carbon capture incentives centers the idea that we need to incentivize climate solutions so they can scale. But the truth is, we don’t need to scale carbon capture because we already have the solutions we need. Renewables are vastly cleaner, more climate-friendly, and less expensive than fossil fuels combined with carbon capture.

Researchers have broadly concluded that 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. is not only feasible, but also comparable to or cheaper than our current grid. A 2025 study found that the cost of electricity with 100% renewables would be nearly half the cost in the “business as usual” fossil fuel scenario.

Subsidies for carbon capture would only make a fossil-fueled future even more expensive. Under 45Q, capturing every single U.S. CO2 emission at the source would cost us $3.4-4.8 trillion over the 12 years that projects can claim the credit.

The carbon capture industry — including fossil fuel corporations — is banging on the doors of Congress, demanding even more support for carbon capture. Along with more tax incentives, they also want to fast-track dangerous carbon pipelines and other carbon capture infrastructure.

The industry’s history of fraud, waste, abuse, and resounding failure should be a blaring alarm. We should not be giving carbon capture and fossil fuel companies even more subsidies for a technology that will hurt the climate. And we definitely shouldn’t be doing it at the expense of supporting real climate solutions like renewables.

Congress must change course on 45Q, end CCS subsidies, ban the buildout of CCS infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pollution-Money-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:19.608985

HAGA, Japan (Reuters) -Honda Motor said on Thursday it is developing a platform centred on mid-size hybrid cars and a hybrid system for large vehicles, as the Japanese automaker seeks to boost competitiveness amid a slower shift to fully electric cars.

The new platform, to be deployed in vehicles from 2027 or later, will be designed for hybrids but can also accommodate petrol-only models. Honda said the platform will be about 90 kg (200 lb) lighter than current designs.

Japan's second-biggest automaker after Toyota has stepped up efforts to grow in the U.S. as it faces intense competition in China and other markets, while also grappling with import tariffs and pricing pressure in North America.

The automaker aims to have more than 60% of parts shared across different models using the platform and adopt a modular architecture, aiming to cut costs and speed up development. It said the changes will improve driving stability and handling.

Honda will position batteries on the platform around the centre of vehicles instead of at the rear, and adjust load-bearing for different vehicle weights using fewer unique parts.

The company also unveiled a prototype large-size hybrid system it is considering for models in the D-segment or larger by 2030, potentially targeting the North American market where demand for bigger vehicles remains robust. D-segment models are mid- to large-size cars.

Honda said it aims to boost fuel efficiency by more than 30% compared with similar petrol models, while improving acceleration and towing capacity for objects such as boats and trailers.

The unveiling comes after Honda said in May it plans to launch 13 next-generation hybrid models globally in the four years from 2027.

It is aiming to sell 2.2 million to 2.3 million hybrids by 2030, up from 868,000 sold last year, compared with total sales of 3.8 million vehicles in 2024.

Honda's push underscores how automakers are leaning on hybrids as electric vehicle demand grows more slowly than expected. Rivals Toyota and Hyundai already offer three-row hybrid sport utility vehicles in the U.S.

evening that seeks to bring down home energy bills both immediately and in the long term for residents, while holding large utility corporations accountable.

“Families across the state are struggling to make ends meet, and federal actions like Trump’s budget bill have done nothing but raise prices and cut jobs. We aren’t going to sit idly by while Illinoisans are forced to choose between turning their lights on and feeding their families—we’re going to offer solutions,” said Avelar.

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices by tapping into:

● Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

● Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

● Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents, lowering electricity prices by reducing overall demand, and improves equity in programs by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois. As

utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable

costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

“The hard-working citizens that the Trump administration promised to support are the ones who are suffering. But Illinois is stepping up for our communities,” said Avelar. “This bill is crucial to support not only our residents and families but for our seniors on fixed incomes. Utilities are not, and should never, be a luxury for the working class.”",,N,,2025-11-05 11:01:18.027099

Executive orders and new regulations from the US president, many diametrically opposed to the core values of sustainable investors (diversity and inclusion, equality, the need to combat climate change), have been coming thick and fast. This has affected the prospects for renewables and the energy transition to a much lower carbon economy over the next three to five years.

The biggest impact comes from the reversal, or the abrupt curtailing, of many renewable tax incentives for wind, solar, electric vehicles and green hydrogen which were included in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). A combination of executive orders as well as the so called One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) – signed into law on 4th July 2025 – have been used to do this.

There will be an accelerated phase out of key tax credits, with solar and wind projects needing to be in service by the end of 2027, rather than 2032 previously. However, projects that begin construction within one year of the OBBBA’s enactment will qualify so long as they are in service by 2030 and show evidence of continuous construction.

The market has punished renewable energy stocks since President Trump won the election in late 2024, but the final bill is considered to be much more benign for the sector than the worst-case scenario many feared. The fact that projects can be completed by 2029 or 2030 and still qualify for tax credits is better than the market was expecting.

US wind favours onshore vs. offshore

We believe that the US onshore wind industry will see a significant pull forward in demand between now and 2026, where industry participants are incentivised to begin projects that qualify for the legacy tax credits and the returns on investment are highest. This is confirmed by management teams such as Vestas, who expect installation of onshore wind in the US to be strong in the next year or so. We then expect a demand lull post 2026 in the US. Demand outside the US generally remains strong over next five years and beyond.

This is unhelpful as it puts a strain on the supply chains which have to cope with super-normal demand followed by more muted demand.

Offshore wind in the US has stalled as a technology option. The Trump administration has mounted legal challenges to offshore wind projects which are planned to be built, as well as legal challenges to projects close to completion. Whilst offshore wind is likely to double in Europe in the coming years, it’s not a viable technology in the US at present given the position of the US administration.

Renewable energy remains economically competitive over the longer term

If we instead look at the prospects for renewables over a longer-term horizon, given these subsidies won’t be a factor in the US beyond 2030, the economic viability of renewable energy remains very compelling.

The relative economics of different electricity generation technologies is often measured by working out the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). This includes the cost of building, funding and operating that generation type over the life of the asset and is measured in a cost per unit of energy produced ($/MWh). The most cost competitive technology has the lowest LCOE and the most expensive form of electricity generation has the highest LCOE.

Even after the complete removal of the tax credits, wind and solar are still economically competitive versus all other generation types. So there is a future for them in the US but the economics for developers and operators will be lower, while industrial consumers of this electricity will likely pay more.

Solar underpinned by data centre demand

If we consider solar energy in greater detail, this sector is likely to benefit from huge demand from developers of data centres. There is 9GW of data centres currently under construction and with capital expenditure in this area elevated, the demand for electricity to power data centres used to house AI architectures is expected to remain elevated as well.

Owners and operators of these data centres want three main things from their electricity supplies: power delivered soon, available all the time, and with low carbon impact.

No single energy source ticks all these boxes without caveat, but solar is the clearest winner on these metrics – it can be constructed quickly and is cost competitive. When storage is added the cost is higher, but these customers are less price sensitive.

We therefore expect solar to see a lot of demand growth in the next five years from the AI-led build out.

If we look at the hyper-scalers in Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle and Apple, they are expected to spend more than $2 trillion on data centre capex between 2025-2030. To put this into context, according to Bloomberg, AI and data centre power demand will increase from 4.4% of US power demand to 17% by 2030.

Despite all the negative press around renewables in the US, growth rates for the solar industry in the US are set to accelerate, providing an attractive backdrop for these companies.

Conclusion and investment impacts

Trump’s bonfire of green taxes has had a very negative effect on the US energy transition. Supply chains will be placed under strain this year due to super-normal demand from renewable projects brought forward to qualify for credits before they are removed. It is then expected that renewable energy build out in the US will slow through to 2030.

While the outright energy winners are areas retaining the previous tax incentives – like exploration and production of fossil fuels – which we don’t invest behind, there are still sustainable options such as utility scale solar and battery storage whose attractions are largely unaffected by recent legislation.

Importantly, the removal of tax subsidies is less aggressive than originally feared and the longer-term economics underpinning growth in renewables demand remain intact.

Even without subsidies, wind and solar projects are still viable and will inevitably provide much of the new electricity to meet rising demand for electricity in the US. Renewables in the US are down as a result of Trump’s actions but are far from out.

KEY RISKS

Past performance does not predict future returns. You may get back less than you originally invested.

We recommend this fund is held long term (minimum period of 5 years). We recommend that you hold this fund as part of a diversified portfolio of investments.

The Funds managed by the Sustainable Investment team:

Are expected to conform to our social and environmental criteria.

May hold overseas investments that may carry a higher currency risk. They are valued by reference to their local currency which may move up or down when compared to the currency of a Fund.

May hold Bonds. Bonds are affected by changes in interest rates and their value and the income they generate can rise or fall as a result; The creditworthiness of a bond issuer may also affect that bond's value. Bonds that produce a higher level of income usually also carry greater risk as such bond issuers may have difficulty in paying their debts. The value of a bond would be significantly affected if the issuer either refused to pay or was unable to pay.

May encounter liquidity constraints from time to time. The spread between the price you buy and sell shares will reflect the less liquid nature of the underlying holdings.

May invest in smaller companies and may invest a small proportion (less than 10%) of the Fund in unlisted securities. There may be liquidity constraints in these securities from time to time, i.e. in certain circumstances, the fund may not be able to sell a position for full value or at all in the short term. This may affect performance and could cause the fund to defer or suspend redemptions of its shares. May invest in companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) which is primarily for emerging or smaller companies. The rules are less demanding than those of the official List of the London Stock Exchange and therefore companies listed on AIM may carry a greater risk than a company with a full listing.

May, under certain circumstances, invest in derivatives, but it is not intended that their use will materially affect volatility. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interest rate moves or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions. The use of derivatives may create leverage or gearing resulting in potentially greater volatility or fluctuations in the net asset value of the Fund. A relatively small movement in the value of a derivative's underlying investment may have a larger impact, positive or negative, on the value of a fund than if the underlying investment was held instead. The use of derivative instruments that may result in higher cash levels. Cash may be deposited with several credit counterparties (e.g. international banks) or in short-dated bonds. A credit risk arises should one or more of these counterparties be unable to return the deposited cash.

Do not guarantee a level of income.

The risks detailed above are reflective of the full range of Funds managed by the Sustainable Investment team and not all of the risks listed are applicable to each individual Fund. For the risks associated with an individual Fund, please refer to its Key Investor Information Document (KIID)/PRIIP KID.

The issue of units/shares in Liontrust Funds may be subject to an initial charge, which will have an impact on the realisable value of the investment, particularly in the short term. Investments should always be considered as long term.

,EVs,2025-11-05 15:01:43+00:00,electrive.com,CAM study shows electric cars to see significant growth in 2025,"Chris Randall, Image: CAM",,,,,https://www.electrive.com/2025/11/05/cam-study-shows-electric-cars-to-see-significant-growth-in-2025/,"This category includes pure electric vehicles, but also electric vehicles with range extenders and cars with plug-in hybrid drives.
In second place, with 3.44 million units, are plug-in hybrids, which also include REEVs (Range Extended Electric Vehicles).
The government’s decision to remove electric cars from the list of strategic industries and thus no longer promote them as strongly therefore makes perfect sense.
In 2024, only 269,931 new electric cars were registered on the island in the first nine months.
A total of 600,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids were registered – an increase of 46.6 per cent.","Internationally, e-mobility has been experiencing a considerable upswing so far this year. This is shown by the latest ‘Electromobility Report’ from the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM) in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In the world regions most important to the automotive industry, namely China, Europe and the USA, approximately 12.8 million highly electrified vehicles were sold between the beginning of January and the end of September. In addition to battery-electric cars, this also includes plug-in hybrids. This represents growth of around 30 per cent compared to the same period last year.

NEVs dominate in China

This development continues to be driven primarily by the Chinese market. In the first three quarters, a total of 8.89 million so-called NEVs, short for New Energy Vehicles, were registered in the People’s Republic. This category includes pure electric vehicles, but also electric vehicles with range extenders and cars with plug-in hybrid drives. BEVs clearly dominate with 5.45 million units. In second place, with 3.44 million units, are plug-in hybrids, which also include REEVs (Range Extended Electric Vehicles).

Overall, NEVs achieved a market share of 52.4 per cent during this period, compared to 45.3 per cent in the first three quarters of last year. The development of pure electric cars is particularly encouraging, with growth of 32 per cent and a market share of 32.1 per cent, separate from plug-in hybrids. In the same period last year, the figure was 26.2 per cent. Externally chargeable hybrids, on the other hand, are growing at a much slower pace, with an increase of only 14 per cent.

Pure BEVs are therefore playing an increasingly dominant role in China. In addition, most of these are already being produced by domestic manufacturers. The government’s decision to remove electric cars from the list of strategic industries and thus no longer promote them as strongly therefore makes perfect sense.

A certain degree of consolidation can already be observed in the local market: 70 per cent of new registrations are accounted for by the ten best-selling car companies – led by BYD with a market share of 14.2 per cent. In contrast, 93 of the 169 car manufacturers active in China have a market share of less than 0.1 per cent, which means they are likely to sink into insignificance in the long term.

Although the Volkswagen Group still ranks second in terms of total sales in China, the German automaker’s electric models are not particularly popular in the Middle Kingdom. While battery-electric drives are clearly on the rise, the Wolfsburg-based company, including the Group brands available in China, has seen a 51.3 per cent decline in NEV registrations. While BYD has a market share of 28.7 per cent in this category and Geely has 12.3 per cent, the former number one in China is far behind with 0.9 per cent.

Europe remains the second most important market

While the overall market in Europe is stagnating, strong growth in electrification is also evident here. In the first nine months of this year, 2.72 million highly electrified passenger cars were newly registered across all countries. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, this represents an increase of 27.7 per cent. The market share of pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids is 27.4 per cent. This means that Europe remains the second-largest market for BEVs and PHEVs after China.

Even if plug-in hybrids are excluded, the picture for e-mobility in Europe is encouraging. Vehicles with purely electric drives recorded growth of 24 per cent in the first three quarters of the year. However, BEV sales are anything but evenly distributed across the continent. While battery electric vehicles account for very high shares well above the 30 per cent mark in the Scandinavian countries, and this type of drive is already well established in Central and Western Europe, it still has a niche existence in other regions such as Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

The three largest European markets also present a far from homogeneous picture. In France, new EV registrations fell by nine per cent from 316,000 last year to 289,000. However, this is mainly due to the declining popularity of plug-in hybrids, with sales of purely electric vehicles remaining stable at 216,000. The BEV market share is 24 per cent, down from 25 per cent in the first few months of 2024. One of the reasons for the slowdown is that the French government has tightened the criteria for subsidies.

In the UK, on the other hand, e-mobility is on the rise. A total of around 522,000 BEVs and PHEVs were registered, representing an increase of around 32 per cent over the previous year. The market share of highly electrified vehicles thus rose from 26 to 33 per cent. Pure electric cars account for the lion’s share of this, with 349,414 units. In 2024, only 269,931 new electric cars were registered on the island in the first nine months. This growth is mainly driven by a significantly expanded range of models, lower prices and various government and municipal support measures relating to charging infrastructure and vehicle fleets.

After a weak 2024, e-mobility is achieving the strongest growth of the three countries in Germany this year. A total of 600,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids were registered – an increase of 46.6 per cent. The market share of the two electrified drive types is 28 per cent, compared to 19 per cent in the same period last year. Pure BEVs accounted for 382,000 units. CAM attributes the positive figures on the domestic market primarily to manufacturers’ electric model offensives, shorter delivery times and increasing acceptance of this drive type in company fleets.

“In Europe, despite strong growth in 2025, the ramp-up of electric mobility is in a critical transition phase with uneven development. The current discussion surrounding the increasingly ideological debate about a possible softening of the so-called ‘2035 combustion engine ban’ is causing considerable uncertainty among consumers and is hampering the rapid market ramp-up necessary for scaling,” summarised Stefan Bratzel, founder and director of CAM.

The US market is developing much more slowly

The renaissance of the electric car was kicked off by Tesla in the US, but compared to Europe and China, growth there has been modest this year. New registrations of electric cars and plug-in hybrids rose by only eight per cent to 1.22 million vehicles between the beginning of January and the end of September. This put the market share at 10 per cent in the first three quarters. In the same period last year, it was 9.7 per cent. For purely electric vehicles, it rose from 8.0 to 8.2 per cent.

After the tax credits for electric cars expired on 1 October, there was another rush for battery-powered vehicles in September. A decline is expected in the fourth quarter due to the significantly worsened market conditions under the Trump administration.

Geely posts 90 per cent BEV growth

Not only in China itself, but also globally, the BEV market is shifting in favour of Chinese manufacturers. BYD had already overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest electric car manufacturer. In the first three quarters, the group increased its deliveries by 37 per cent to 1.61 million vehicles. The share of BEVs in total sales grew from 43 to 56 per cent. Geely even increased by almost 90 per cent to 943,000 BEVs. Tesla, on the other hand, lost ground slightly, with deliveries falling by 5.9 per cent to 1.22 million vehicles.

While things are going downhill in China, the outlook for German carmakers is somewhat better globally. The Volkswagen Group increased its worldwide electric car sales by 42 per cent to 717,500 vehicles, mainly due to high popularity in the European market. BMW’s BEV business grew moderately by 10 per cent to 323,000 cars, while Mercedes-Benz remained slightly below the previous year’s level with 118,000 units, representing a one per cent decline. The Stuttgart-based company’s market share declined modestly to 8 per cent.

“Duke is one of a very few Ph.D. programs that offers an interdisciplinary approach to integrate policy, economics and energy. And the opportunity to work with faculty member Dalia (Patino-Echeverri) was the perfect fit,” he said.

His research at Duke grew out of North Carolina’s carbon planning process, where he was involved in a pivotal research question: how quickly solar projects could be connected to the grid. Norris began studying how interconnection policies shape the pace of renewable deployment, an inquiry that quickly expanded nationwide.

In 2023, he co-authored a white paper on rethinking interconnection and load growth, just as artificial intelligence and data centers began driving massive new electricity demand.

“By early 2024, it was clear that something very different was happening,” Norris said. “Large load growth was reshaping energy planning, and that this was going to have very significant implications for the power system.”

Through the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability and with faculty member Tim Profeta, Norris was involved in a Duke convening focused on large load growth. That event led directly to the groundbreaking paper — the most downloaded in the institute’s history.

The paper proposed a paradigm shift: planning the grid around flexible loads, such as data centers that can adjust electricity consumption in response to system needs.

“We’ve never planned the system this way before,” Norris explained. “But flexibility could help maintain reliability, control costs and reduce emissions.”

Regulators, utilities and companies across the country have taken notice. Norris testified on the research before the U.S. House Energy subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. “Organizations are now exploring proposals for large-load demand response programs. California has begun scaling similar programs from the distribution level to the transmission grid,” Norris said.

A Bipartisan Path Forward

The idea has found support across political lines.

“The full U.S. House passed an appropriations bill calling on the Department of Energy to study large-load flexibility alongside FERC, national labs and universities,” Norris noted. “It’s been gratifying to see that this has maintained a bipartisan posture.”

The paper’s influence, coupled with Norris’s clear-eyed optimism, caught the attention of policymakers, academics and industry leaders. Google offered him a role developing new approaches to clean energy deployment; he begins this month while finishing his Ph.D.

For Norris, the experience underscores the power of entrepreneurship and innovation. “Sometimes it’s helpful to come in with a fresh, independent perspective and apply first principles thinking,” he reflected. “If you’re too deep inside an existing system, it can be hard to imagine doing things differently.”

What started as a Ph.D. research project is now influencing national energy policy and industry practice.

“Honestly,” he said, “I was shocked that no one had done this analysis before. It can be easy to get intimidated by the complexity of an issue, and you might have imposter syndrome, because you think you’re not a deep expert. But I think there’s so much value in bringing fresh perspectives and looking at a problem from the bottom up and trying to think about a different type of solution.”",https://today.duke.edu/sites/default/files/styles/1200_x_630px/public/2025-11/Norris%20DT.png?itok=Ie9byUBy,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:40.107171

“The GHGRP works. It’s a proven framework that ensures transparency, builds trust in American products, and strengthens our global position in low-carbon energy,” said Buis. “Scaling it back now would create chaos for carbon management projects and threaten billions in clean energy investment.”

Buis noted that many companies pursuing carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects depend on the GHGRP’s standardized data for critical federal tax incentives such as Section 45Q for carbon sequestration and Section 45V for clean hydrogen production. Without this reliable federal system, businesses would face new layers of uncertainty, reporting conflicts, and investment delays.

“If the GHGRP is repealed or weakened, it will freeze capital investment in carbon capture projects,” Buis said. “Investors, lenders, and innovators rely on the EPA’s verification process to ensure confidence and compliance.

Good morning everyone.

It’s a pleasure to be here although I have spent the past 15 months as Energy Minister reading Cornwall Insight’s insights and it is therefore with some trepidation I step into the breach to speak to you.

But now is a good time to be talking about energy.

Your insights often focus not just on what is changing in our energy system, but on why it matters.

Not just taking the pulse of energy in the UK, but turning that into foresight.

And there has surely not been a time in recent memory when energy is such an active topic of conversation, not just among us nerds, but in the press, and the public discourse, and yes, on social media too – although I would discourage you from reading the variety of offensive replies I get almost every day.

Energy matters.

Not just energy bills, energy shocks, but some of the more technical stuff once found only in the pages of industry journals.

The future of our energy mix, the transmission network, long duration energy storage, energy jobs, our North Sea, the current focus on energy points to a wider truth.

As a country we are at a fork in the road, and face some major decisions about our future.

The system that has powered our homes and businesses, kept the lights on, underpinned the fabric of everyday life, was constructed, both physically and ideologically, in the 20th century.

And it is not working for working people as it once did, not just because the infrastructure is ageing, but because, ideologically, the idea that we can have energy security while dependent on fossil fuels whose prices are set globally has come crashing down.

We need an energy system for this new era of global insecurity.

But we face choices, huge choices, about how we get there.

There are 2 paths ahead of us.

Frequently in our political discourse today is the yellow brick road of the easy answer. The mirage of nostalgia, prolonging the status quo a little longer. And we all know where that road leads – to stagnation, managed decline, and never tackling the deep rooted, complex challenges that hold our country back.

And, on the other hand, the hard work of renewal – accepting the reality that there are no easy answers, or quick fixes, and that the status quo isn’t working, and hasn’t been for far too long.

And this choice applies to the 3 fundamental questions I face as energy minister, which I am going to talk to you about today.

Where will our energy come from?

How will we get it to where it’s needed?

And how will we take the country with us as we transition to a 21st century energy system?

Where will our energy come from?

Let me start with the first one.

Not just because ‘where will our energy come from’ is a fairly fundamental question for the Minister for Energy, but because it is critical for the future of our country.

For a very, very long time most people on these islands haven’t thought very much about what happens when they flick on the light switch. Electrons flow, the system responds.

But in truth, behind the curtain, the system is struggling as a result of decades of underinvestment and a lack of strategic planning. Neglect. Decline.

We are still heavily reliant on gas, and yet half our existing fleet of gas plants is more than 20 years old with many approaching retirement in less than 10 years.

The year before I was born was the last time a UK government took a decision to build a new nuclear power station that is currently generating electricity – 1987.

We haven’t brought a new nuclear power station onto the system since I started primary school.

Our transmission system is creaking under the weight of demand it cannot meet and the failure to invest over decades.

Now some – those seekers of the easy answer – would suggest we simply generate more electricity with gas, and worry about the threat of climate change another time.

They compare the wholesale cost of gas without any of the capital costs of construction with the total cost of building new renewable generation and hope nobody notices the difference.

But in truth, our ageing gas fleet means that we would need to rebuild a new, more expensive version of our existing power system and impose the costs onto consumers, while leaving us more exposed than ever to the global price of fossil fuels, over which we have no control.

Showing that we have learned nothing from the hardship people up and down the country have suffered since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Without taking a penny off our bills, we would be turning our back on every climate commitment that a succession of governments of all parties have made over the last 20 years. Abandoning our children and grandchildren, who will have to face the effects of the climate crisis, and swimming against the unstoppable global tide, where $2 trillion is now being invested in clean energy each year - twice as much as fossil fuels.

The path of decline, stagnation, easy answers.

But our answer is a different plan.

Homegrown clean power.

Solar and wind power are substantially cheaper to install and run than new gas.

And supported by nuclear, storage and other technologies, our clean power system will:

reduce our exposure as a country to fossil fuel price hikes

help us to take back control of our energy

cut our bills by reducing the wholesale costs of electricity

protect our way of life for future generations by tackling the climate crisis, and

push Britain to the front of the global race to clean power, so that we can seize the jobs and opportunities of the future

That is why we have been sprinting to achieve clean power.

Deploying renewables at a scale that will push gas off as the price setter and bring down bills – in the first 15 months approving enough projects to power 7.5 million homes.

Investing in the biggest nuclear building programme in half a century, and making sure the UK is at the forefront of new nuclear technology.

Establishing our first publicly owned energy champion in 70 years in Great British Energy

And kickstart our hydrogen and carbon capture industries across the country.

And we are just getting started.

How will we get our energy to where it’s needed?

But this leads me to the second question.

How do we get this power to where it’s needed?

Here we inherited a familiar tale of ambition turned to stagnation.

Much of our electricity grid was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been upgraded since.

The National Grid was the first of its kind in the world, a product of 20th century big government through ambitious intervention, building things to improve people’s lives. A spirit that has been replaced by a shrug of the shoulders and blinkered short-termism.

But we can’t afford to be short-termist as a country any longer.

We have arrived at the age of electric vehicles, data centres and artificial intelligence, and a demand for electricity demand that is expected to more than double by 2050.

Do we take the easy road?

Patch up what we have, hope it lasts to the next election and leave it to someone else to sort?

If we do, then consumers will need to help pay up to £4 billion in constraint payments by 2030.

If we do we will fail to meet the economic growth opportunities coming our way in the years ahead.

We’ll fail to keep up with the coming electricity demand.

So, we are taking the second road.

We choose to build, reform, innovate and invest.

We have ended the first come first serve grid connections queue.

We have introduced the biggest reform of planning in a generation.

And we know that the way the electricity market works needed to change.

That is why, this summer, we announced a new Reformed National Pricing Programme which, along with the upcoming Strategic Spatial Energy Plan, will allow us to reform our power market and build a power system based on centralised, strategic, big-picture planning, instead of slow and uncoordinated fragmentation.

So that new energy sources are built where they’re needed most, and as the power grid grows, it will keep up with the energy we’ll need and send it where it needs to go.

This is how we will deliver security, prevent volatility, cut constraint payments for consumers, encourage investment, and build a network for the 21st century.

How will we take the country with us?

For any of this to work, however, we need to take people with us.

How we do that is the third question.

We as a country are still coming to terms with the consequences of sudden change that happens to communities, rather than for them, and with them.

Deindustrialisation has left its scars, and they run deep across our old industrial heartlands.

So let me make one point abundantly clear.

If we accept that a historic moment of industrial change is needed, then the lessons from the past must be learned. We must build a Britain for the British people.

Take the North Sea. The oil and gas workers there have helped to power our country and the world for more than half a century and will continue to do so for decades to come, with oil and gas retaining an important role within our energy system.

But we cannot accept the status quo, barely managed decline of the last decade, which has seen more than a third of jobs in this industry lost and other countries getting ahead in the technologies that should be safeguarding our energy future.

If we want to create new good jobs and revitalise our industrial regions, then we must build on their legacy and the expertise of these workers to make Britain a world-leading centre of clean energy.

The momentum is with us.

According to the CBI, the net zero sector is now growing 3 times faster than the overall UK economy.

And employment in clean energy sectors is up 10%, with those jobs paying 15% higher than average.

I’ve been lucky enough to see what that means in reality, up and down the country, from the proud offshore workers in Scotland and the North East of England, pursuing new opportunities in new industries, to the new nuclear projects from Suffolk to Hartlepool, launching fantastic careers for young people right at the forefront of energy innovation, without having to move hundreds of miles from home.

This is the second path, the path to a brighter future, in action.

And last week, we published our Clean Energy Jobs Plan, showcasing not just the hundreds of thousands of good jobs that you in the room here today and others are already supporting in this sector, but the jobs of the future, as we aim to almost triple the number in Scotland, double the number in Wales, Northern Ireland and almost every region of England, and reach 860,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade.

Conclusion

Sometimes, amidst the comments, the headlines, the sound and the fury of the debates around what our energy future should look like, we forget that we all want the same thing - a modern energy system that can make our lives better.

So, the 2 paths I set out today are not divided by intention, they are separated by their levels of ambition.

The ambition we are offering is huge. It will be hard. It is hard.

But the role of government is to do hard things.

Perhaps after years of stagnation, we have forgotten that.

But this government has a mission to seize the opportunities of clean energy, and we will do the difficult things to achieve it.

Let me leave you with this, for those who doubt whether we can achieve our mission.

A few weeks ago, if you happened to be awake at 3:30am and turned the light on to find your phone or check on the kids, then you were making use of the first 100% low-carbon electricity this country has ever had.

For 1 hour we were generating enough from renewables, nuclear, and biomass alone to meet our entire national electricity demand.

The first time, but not the last.

If we all work together, we can get there.

And we can write the next chapter in this country’s proud energy history.

But only if we marry action with ambition, and take the road that goes forward, not backwards, to a fairer, more secure, more prosperous future.

In 2021, when Taiwan faced its worst drought in 56 years, the world confronted an uncomfortable reality: the chips powering our phones, cars, and satellites rely on a resource that nature no longer guarantees—water.

This vulnerability stands in stark contrast to the industry’s origins. In the 1980s, amid Taiwan’s declining chemical sector, Morris Chang was invited to return to Asia to lead a critical project that would lay the foundation for the semiconductor industry. In 1987, he founded the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Today, Taiwan’s economy is at the epicentre of the global semiconductor industry, with the sector valued at $165.6 billion in 2024. One key factor in its success lies in the pure-play foundry model, which is manufacturing chips for clients rather than designing its own.

TSMC’s manufacturing success comes at an ecological cost. The company accounts for around 150,000 tonnes of water per day and 6.4% of the national electricity consumption. With the challenges posed by climate change, experts are raising concerns about its impact on water scarcity. This intensity brings us to the water-energy nexus, where water and energy are interdependent. In essence, the semiconductor industry demands enormous volumes of water to generate energy, while its water supply also depends on a constant energy source. This situation thus raises a question: can TSMC continue to dominate the industry while ensuring sustainable water usage?

The Water-Energy Nexus in TSMC

In semiconductor fabs, water is an equally crucial resource for cleaning wafers, thin, flat slices of silicon that serve as the foundation for microchip fabrication. They depend on each other: water is extensively used to cool machines and clean semiconductors, while electricity powers the systems that circulate water, purify it, and generate energy from it.

96.6% of water used in semiconductor manufacturing comes from natural freshwater sources, while only 3.2% is recycled. In other words, most of the water is used once and discharged, rather than being continuously reused. Meanwhile, roughly 84% of the electricity powering fabs still originates from fossil fuels, linking chip production to both carbon emissions and hydrological stress. At TSMC, this interdependence is intensified by its pure-play foundry model: as global demand for technology rises, so does the pressure on Taiwan’s limited water and energy resources.

The 2021 drought made this tension visible. With fewer typhoons and irregular rainfall, reservoirs supplying Hsinchu Science Park—the heart of Taiwan’s semiconductor cluster—fell to historic lows. Scientists also attributed the shortage to rising temperatures.

Progress and Barriers Toward Sustainability

To address these vulnerabilities, TSMC has invested heavily in advanced water management. In 2022, the company launched the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) Reclaimed Water Plant, which converts treated wastewater into an industrial-grade supply. By 2026, this facility is expected to support up to 36,000 tonnes of reclaimed water daily, enough to meet 60% of the company’s local demand by 2030. While this marks significant progress, it also underscores how dependent fabs remain on external water sources. Yet even this success leaves a 40% reliance on traditional reservoirs—a vulnerable reliance as Taiwan faces longer dry seasons and fewer typhoons.

In 2024, TSMC introduced the Ammonia Nitrogen Wastewater Diversion and Processing Inspection System. This system sorts wastewater based on ammonia nitrogen levels, sending low-concentration water to biological treatment and high-concentration water to a degassing membrane process. At Fab 20 Phase 1, this has already resulted in a 40% reduction in discharged wastewater conductivity and a 30% cut in chemical reagent use. These advances show that incremental innovation can reduce harm. But they also show the scale of the problem, that is, the sector’s overall expansion outpaces each fab’s progress. Beyond Taiwan, TSMC’s 15-acre Industrial Water Reclamation Plant at its manufacturing complex in Phoenix, Arizona—scheduled to begin operations by 2028—illustrates how the water-energy dilemma follows the industry. Located in the drought-stricken Colorado River Basin, the facility aims to recycle nearly all on-site water, positioning it as a model for adaptation in arid environments.

While the semiconductor industry has made progress toward sustainability, there is still a gap between adopting clean energy and fully integrating it across all operations. Many existing manufacturing facilities need major upgrades to handle renewable energy, which comes with high upfront costs. For example, TSMC’s new expansion in Arizona has led to higher construction costs and the need for specialised worker training. As these structural challenges intensify, the focus shifts from technological capability to governance, encompassing institutional frameworks, policy alignment, and regulatory coordination necessary to support a sustainable industrial transition.

Renewable energy itself also has challenges. Solar and wind power are variable, and semiconductor fabs need a steady, reliable supply of electricity. Even though solar energy is growing rapidly worldwide, the International Energy Agency recently lowered its global renewable power capacity forecast by 248 gigawatts to 4,600 GW by 2030, mainly due to policy changes in the U.S. and China. This shows how difficult it can be to ensure a consistent and sufficient energy supply.

The global semiconductor supply chain adds another layer of complexity. Implementing clean energy across the entire supply chain is challenging. Even though global chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung pledge to power operations with 100% renewable energy, these targets may not be reached until 2030 or later. The path remains steep. Semiconductor manufacturing remains highly resource-intensive, with fabs now requiring costly retrofits. Global electricity demand for chip production is expected to reach 237 terawatt-hours by 2030, contributing to rising greenhouse gas emissions.

Can Growth and Sustainability Coexist?

TSMC’s efforts show that technological solutions can ease the strain, but they do not erase the underlying vulnerability. Water recycling plants, wastewater innovations, and overseas facilities may reduce pressure, yet their sustainability strategy cannot fully insulate them from ecological volatility. At the same time, the slow pace of renewable integration and the high demands of chip manufacturing mean that sustainability depends on more than corporate initiatives — it ultimately depends on national infrastructure reform, regional cooperation, and diversified energy sourcing.

In the long run, TSMC’s ability to dominate the industry will depend on its capacity to achieve sustainable water and energy management. Without deeper structural reform in these systems, its long-term leadership may be undermined by the very resources it consumes.

Morning Reads

Trump Tariffs Fate Rides on Supreme Court Justices He Picked (Greg Stohr, Bloomberg)(Paywall) — Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, who were all appointed to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, “will play pivotal roles as the court considers the fate of his signature global tariffs Wednesday,” according to Bloomberg. “[T]o varying degrees, the Trump appointees have hinted that they aren’t sure bets to back him as he seeks unprecedented authority to levy tariffs in the name of addressing national emergencies.”

Trump’s not going to the Supreme Court hearing on tariffs. But his treasury secretary will be there (Fatima Hussein, Associated Press) — While Trump won’t be at today’s oral arguments, one of his top economic advisers will be. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he will “hopefully [be] in the front row and … have a ringside seat” for the discussion, according to the Associated Press. “I am there to emphasize that this is an economic emergency,” Bessent said.

Texas county book ban could go to SCOTUS (Asher Price, Axios) — Four years ago, officials in Llano County, Texas, “ordered 17 books removed from libraries after conservative activists alleged they were ‘pornographic filth,'” according to Axios. That order led to a dispute between officials and a group of county residents over whether such book removals violate free speech. “A federal judge in Austin in 2023 ruled for the residents, ordering the county to return to the public library system books they removed and allow them to be checked out again.” But then in May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the “removal of certain books was government speech — and not subject to free speech challenges.” The residents have asked the Supreme Court to review that decision as controversies over book bans persist nationwide.

Slur or free speech? Willamette hosts band at the center of landmark Supreme Court case (Paul McKean, Willamette University) — The rock band The Slants recently visited Willamette University to give a “lecture-performance … about Asian American identity, art, and free speech,” as well as their experience in front of the Supreme Court, according to the school’s coverage of the event. In 2017, the band was at the center of a case on free speech and trademark rights, in which the court held that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s refusal to register the band’s name due to concerns about it being derogatory violated the First Amendment. “People said that we were this band that turned stereotypes upside down,” band member Simon Tam said. “We had to fight back.”

The Tariff King and the Supreme Court (The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board)(Paywall) — In a column on the tariffs case, The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board called on the court to reject the Trump administration’s claims about the president’s foreign-policy authority and embrace a much more limited view of “presidential tariff power.” “Few conservatives are more deferential to presidential overseas authority than we are,” the board wrote. “But the power of the purse still belongs to Congress and can’t simply be wished away with the words ‘foreign policy.’ Tariffs are taxes on Americans.”

A Closer Look: The Major Questions Doctrine

The major questions doctrine, a judicial principle that courts have used to scrutinize expansive claims of statutory authority by executive agencies, will likely be an important part of today’s oral arguments on Trump’s sweeping tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Ultimately, in accordance with this doctrine, the court may ask: Did Congress really give the president power to make decisions of “vast economic and political significance” without explicitly saying so? As Chief Justice John Roberts put it in West Virginia v. EPA, courts should “hesitate” to greenlight “extravagant” claims of power based on (seemingly) vague statutory language.

Some scholars maintain that the major questions doctrine has been around for some time. But this doctrine arguably entered the public discourse in the 2000 case of FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., where the court rejected the Food and Drug Administration’s attempt to regulate tobacco products – ruling that Congress had not granted the FDA that authority under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the following year when referencing the case, Congress does not “hide elephants in mouseholes,” meaning they wouldn’t delegate such broad authority through ambiguous phrases. In this way, the doctrine may act like a backstop to the Constitution’s separation of powers: Congress makes the big calls on taxes, regulations, and trade, and can’t punt those to the executive branch (or at least the executive agencies) without explicit instructions.

In early 2022, the court in a 6-3 ruling in National Federation of Independent Businesses v. OSHA stopped a vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers, reasoning that shoehorning pandemic rules into a 1970 workplace-safety law was too big a stretch. Later that year, West Virginia v. EPA weakened the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulation of coal-plant emissions, with Roberts warning that shifting the nation’s energy grid demanded more than the agency relying on an “ancillary provision” in the Clean Air Act. And in 2023’s Biden v. Nebraska, the court “ruled that the Biden administration overstepped its authority” in attempting to cancel roughly $400 billion in student loans under a higher education law, calling the scope of this “staggering” and unprecedented.

Critics of the major questions doctrine have argued that it allows judges to substitute their policy preferences for Congress’ intent, especially when what constitutes “major” feels like a moving target. As Justice Elena Kagan, dissenting in West Virginia, argued, the doctrine can be used to ignore how modern statutes often use broad terms precisely because Congress can’t manage everything. But supporters like Justice Neil Gorsuch see it as essential to “protect[ing] foundational constitutional guarantees.” And Justice Amy Coney Barrett has endorsed the major questions doctrine as an important interpretive tool.

In the tariffs fight, the Trump administration is expected to claim, among other things, that its actions were clearly authorized under IEEPA and that the doctrine doesn’t apply in the foreign policy context or to the president (as opposed to the executive agencies). But, in the view of Adam White, who recently wrote for SCOTUSblog, “In the end … arguments over the technical application of a major questions doctrine may simply be a red herring. Whether or not the court explicitly invokes the major questions doctrine by name, or if it simply undertakes its own best reading of IEEPA’s use of the term ‘regulate’ with a measure of skepticism toward Trump’s unprecedented claims of power, the sheer magnitude of power claimed by the president, and its practical effects, should give it pause.”

SCOTUS Quote

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Ginzburg says that all the courts — almost all the courts of appeals have decided this question against you, and the leading commentators take the opposite position. How do you account for that?

MS. BLATT: … And I think just last term you ruled against a case I argued when all the courts had gone our way.

The Other Arguments in Trump’s Tariffs Case

When the Supreme Court hears oral arguments today in the challenges to Trump’s tariffs, they will hear from three different lawyers representing small businesses, a group of 12 states, and – defending the tariffs – the Trump administration. But when they vote on the case, the justices will also have considered 44 “friend of the court” briefs filed on behalf of members of Congress, trade experts, legal scholars, think tanks founded by former Vice President Mike Pence and presidential adviser Stephen Miller, the watch industry, and a vineyard owner. The briefs cover a wide range of topics, from the impact of the tariffs to the history of trade law. Learn more about them by reading Amy’s analysis.

The Tariffs Case and Whether Amicus Briefs Matter

Erwin Chemerinsky also analyzed the amicus briefs filed in the tariffs case in his latest Courtly Observations column and highlighted what stood out to him in the filings. He noted that there were notably fewer briefs overall than in other recent high-profile cases, and that “it also was striking how many of the amicus briefs against the Trump administration were filed by conservative groups.”

Looking at this company, I have to consider the question: why aren't more companies putting ethics and success in conversation with one another?
This lack of distinction is only making ""sustainable business"" initiatives seem less achievable than they actually are.
The company that cried green is not just one tale of a company that lied, and the consumers who believed them; the company that cried green is a trend.","It's better to dress something down than to fake it up. Yet most of us are taught the opposite: When entering a new space, we try to fit in, play the part and meet the standard. This ""fake it until you make it"" mentality is not only harmful to ourselves but also to our physical environments, corroding the integrity of the spaces we're trying to fit into and threatening their future existence.

I'm talking about greenwashing, a term for false claims made by a company about the environmental benefits of its practices or products. Think back to the 2009 Volkswagen scandal: the company marketed its cars as ""clean diesel cars,"" while cheating emissions tests to the Environmental Protection Agency behind the scenes.

Greenwashing is worse than a company that openly prioritizes profitability over sustainability. At least that’s honest. Giants like Exxon or JPMorgan should stop pretending to be environmental champions and admit that no consumer truly favors them because of their environmental consciousness, philanthropic goals or stringent codes of ethics. It's time for these corporate companies to stop pretending to be something they're not and start owning the fact that they will never try to be anything else.

That's not to say that to be successful, a company cannot have a genuine commitment to charity; in fact, for some companies, this is a reality. Take Newman's Own, for example, a successful nonprofit organization committed to giving all profits to children's charities. If success is measured by outreach and scale, then Newman's Own surpasses those standards while meeting its humanitarian goals. Looking at this company, I have to consider the question: why aren't more companies putting ethics and success in conversation with one another?

The answer is more nuanced than you'd think. While there may exist some gaps between ethical compliance and profitability, the bigger problem lies in the culture. Between greenwashing campaigns, the implementation of ""ethical"" courses in business schools, such as the newly introduced AI and Ethics course in UMass Amherst’s Isenberg and a growing social impact crusade consuming college campuses, it's becoming increasingly challenging to differentiate truth from marketing. This lack of distinction is only making ""sustainable business"" initiatives seem less achievable than they actually are.

Ethics and charity should be chosen, not imposed. It's vital that, rather than an institutional body requiring them to, people take the first steps themselves. At the Stanford Graduate School of Business, for example, the Sustainability Strategies Program offers students the opportunity to engage with the environmental and social impacts of business practices and learn how to mitigate effects such as pollution and resource overconsumption. Here, students aren’t just learning, they’re applying. Unlike a typical lecture hall, the program is dynamic, and encourages students to develop their own sustainable initiatives for case studies and projects. Giving students the option to choose their engagement with sustainability is a wake-up call that business programs requiring sustainability credits to graduate must hear. Even if it looks good on paper, sustainability courses shouldn't be offered to students unless there is a demand for them, or else they run the risk of being treated as accessories that only work to beautify universities.

The same argument applies to social impact clubs at Cornell that are treated as niche resume boosters rather than experiences that shape long-term initiatives and goals. In both cases, groups are wielding sustainability as a mighty marketing sword, sharpened by the idea that in doing so, companies, clubs and other institutions will seem more attractive.

The company that cried green is not just one tale of a company that lied, and the consumers who believed them; the company that cried green is a trend. It's a cyclic pattern of false marketing, and diluted hope that any ethical goals — sustainability, diversity in the workplace and other charitable initiatives — will ever be supported in the long-term. Companies, whether they truly apply these goals or not, must face the fact that if nothing changes soon, one day consumers and future employees alike will stop believing them.

For decades, environmental groups in Ohio and elsewhere have used air nuisance rules in state plans as a catchall way to enforce the federal Clean Air Act.
“The air nuisance rule is the tool that Ohioans have to hold polluters accountable,” said Neil Waggoner, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Midwest.
Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.
In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.","As of Sept. 30, Ohio lawmakers eliminated a key legal tool used to rein in air pollution from power plants and industrial sites. Now, advocates are suing to restore that right.

For decades, environmental groups in Ohio and elsewhere have used air nuisance rules in state plans as a catchall way to enforce the federal Clean Air Act. Ohio’s version let people take legal action against companies whose emissions ​“endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, or cause unreasonable injury or damage to property.” The rule dates back more than 50 years.

Environmental groups have used air nuisance rules to file or threaten lawsuits against coal-burning power plants, iron and steel facilities, coke plants, and other industrial operations, which emit not only planet-warming greenhouse gases but also harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead.

Defendants in cases brought under Ohio’s version of the rule have included Suncoke Energy, AK Steel–Middletown Works, Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Phthalchem. Consent decrees and settlements have produced orders or agreements to stop alleged nuisances, clean up waste, and expand monitoring.

But a last-minute addition to the state’s 3,156-page budget bill, House Bill 96, told the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cut that protection out of the state’s Clean Air Act plan.

“The air nuisance rule is the tool that Ohioans have to hold polluters accountable,” said Neil Waggoner, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Midwest. ​“This is the state government saying … we’re going to take this away from you in the most secretive fashion possible.”

The Sierra Club is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with the Ohio Environmental Council, SOBE Concerned Citizens, and the Freshwater Accountability Project. The fifth plaintiff, Donna Ballinger, is a Middletown resident who lives close to iron and steel operations, which she claims cause nuisance conditions. An August report by the Environmental Integrity Project documented likely air quality problems in that area.

Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.

For months, the Trump administration has been rolling back federal pollution standards and making huge personnel cuts to the staff charged with enforcing the remaining rules and permits. The Ohio EPA has authority to enforce the Clean Air Act but doesn’t always pursue alleged violations.

“Both at the federal and state level, we’re seeing less enforcement,” said Miranda Leppla, who heads Case Western Reserve University’s Environmental Law Clinic and represents the Ohio Environmental Council and the Sierra Club in the lawsuit. ​“If Ohioans don’t have the ability to bring these enforcement actions on their own through the air nuisance rule, there’s a very serious concern that air quality will continue to degrade and Ohioans’ health will get worse.”

Echoing a recent law in Louisiana, HB 96 also blocks the Ohio EPA from acting on data that groups may collect through community air-monitoring efforts. Such data can fill important gaps and alert communities and enforcement officials to problems that may not be detected by EPA monitors miles away.

Ohio’s limits on using the data will particularly harm fence-line communities, Leppla said.

“At a time when Ohio is seeing renewed industrial building, including new facilities like data centers, as well as a greater federal push for more fossil fuels, it is more important than ever that Ohioans preserve their right to both collect air pollution data themselves and use that data to file suits against harmful air nuisances,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council.

The complaint, filed on Oct. 24 in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, asserts that lawmakers violated the single-subject rule in the Ohio Constitution when they tacked the air pollution provisions onto the massive budget bill.

“This is fundamentally unrelated to the main purpose of the biennial budget,” Waggoner said. ​“And it was stuck in here in an intentional way so that folks would not have an opportunity to see it, talk about it, or debate its merits.”

The Sierra Club, Ohio Environmental Council, and other groups raised a similar argument two years ago after eleventh-hour changes to a bill about poultry included a new definition of natural gas as ​“green energy.” That case, also at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, has been briefed, and parties are waiting for Judge Kimberly Cocroft to issue her ruling.

A 2019 decision in Paulding County, Ohio, rejected a challenge to the late amendment in the 2014 budget bill that tripled property-line setbacks for turbines on wind farms. That case wasn’t appealed and would not bind the court in Franklin County.

Despite the similarities, the new lawsuit is different because the ban goes beyond how state agencies operate, Leppla said. ​“The air nuisance rule was created specifically to allow Ohioans who are suffering from noxious air pollution and nuisances to protect themselves when the government does not act.”

HB 96 is not the first attempt to take away Ohioans’ right to bring air nuisance claims. In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.

The Ohio Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, Ballinger, and another Sierra Club member mounted a successful challenge in federal court, but due to delays in agency action it wasn’t until this February that the rule became effective again.

“And now here we are with the Ohio legislature attempting to remove it again, when it had already been found to be illegal to do so,” Leppla said.

To prevent another lapse, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit have asked Judge Julie Lynch to grant a preliminary injunction against removing the rule while the case proceeds.

As defendants, the State of Ohio and the director of Ohio EPA have 28 days to file responses after the complaint was served. What happens next will depend on those filings and the judge’s rulings on any motions.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1244387963.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=51b02f771fbda5cb429f317fd1aa5e81,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:04.780987

It’s even lobbying Europe to ban new ICE vehicles by 2035.","An EV revolution has been trumpeted for decades, but while Asia and Europe jumped in headfirst, America is still having trouble dipping its toes in the water. After an initial surge in market share, EVs have slowed and even stalled, making up just 7.4% of total vehicles as of June 2025, according to CarEdge. The well-known federal tax credit that gave new EV buyers up to $7,500 has also been eliminated, meaning the EV sales boom of July, August, and September 2025 was likely a blip of people taking advantage of the credit while they could.

There are many reasons for the slow adoption of EVs stateside, including high costs and depreciation, concerns about long-term performance, and a lack of EV charging infrastructure in more public and private rural areas. Either way, consumer demand has been far below what many automakers anticipated when they invested big dollars in their EV programs. Because of this, and aided by other factors like increased tariffs and relaxed emissions regulations, some automakers are scaling back or even eliminating their EV plans in favor of vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs).

All the automakers in question cited low sales and/or lack of profits as the main reason for the shift. As the old saying goes, follow the money, and that’s what automotive manufacturers are doing. We’re going to follow that trail and examine some companies that have significantly scaled back their EV plans, and what they’re focusing on instead.

Ford

The Blue Oval was all-in on EVs for the first half of the 2020s, introducing the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit in short order. However, the New York Times reports that since 2023, the Ford EV division is $12 billion in the hole. That’s a number even a worldwide conglomerate like Ford can’t ignore. In September 2024, Ford announced that its Oakville, Ontario assembly factory would switch its planned focus from electric sports cars and SUVs to ICE pickup trucks. Demand has increased for the very profitable Ford Super Duty, and the automaker responded in kind. Ford also delayed the release of two new all-electric pickups.

However, in August 2025, Ford announced what it called its “next Model T moment” in the form of a new universal EV platform and a new universal EV production system to build it. This platform’s first vehicle will be an as-yet-unnamed midsize electric pickup priced around $30,000, which will go on sale in 2027. That’s comparable to the existing Ford Ranger. The new platform uses significantly fewer parts and fasteners, and more large aluminum components to speed assembly. Despite being an EV, its wiring harness is 4,000 feet shorter and 22 lbs lighter than the Mustang Mach-E, reports Jalopnik.

It takes years to develop new models, especially such a revolutionary platform and a new production line to build it. It seems likely that Ford was already quite committed to this when the winds of EV enthusiasm changed, and it was too late to back out. Still, if Ford succeeds in producing more EVs that are comparable to or better than current ICE offerings, they could make EV adoption more palatable for those who are still against it.

General Motors

As another early captain on the EV bandwagon, GM said back in 2018 that its goal was to have 50% of its new vehicles all-electric by 2030 and 100% by 2035. To that end, it has released many EVs under several marques, including the Chevy Silverado EV, GMC Hummer EV, and Cadillac LYRIQ.

Now, though, it seems those lofty goals are in jeopardy. The opening of a new Orion assembly plant in Detroit, which was supposed to make the Silverado EV, has now been delayed twice and won’t make its first vehicle until at least mid-2026. They also put the brakes on the first Buick PHEV with no official date in sight. In April 2025, GM reversed course on plans to convert its Toledo, Ohio, plant into a full-scale EV drive unit hub, increasing production on ICE parts instead to support higher light-duty truck output at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, location. More recently, GM said it would reduce production of its Cadillac EVs. Because of the low demand, it has been temporarily laying off workers and even shuttering existing EV plants for weeks at a time. These are major moves for a company that seemed so committed to EVs.

However, after discontinuing the Bolt in 2023, Chevrolet is bringing it back for the 2027 model year. It has a revised interior, and while the outside got little more than a facelift, it is the first Chevy to utilize the NACS charging port pioneered by Tesla. It can fast charge at 150 kW, 2.5 times faster than the previous Bolt, and can charge from 10% to 80% in just 26 minutes. Though priced just under $30,000, the similarly priced 2026 Nissan LEAF exceeds the new Bolt’s capabilities in almost every way. It’s not clear why GM brought the Bolt out of retirement with some significant improvements, but still not enough to keep up with the competition.

Volvo

At one point, Volvo had perhaps the most aggressive EV plan. In 2021, it set a goal of making its entire vehicle lineup all-electric by 2030, and trumpeted its credentials with SUVs like the EX90 full-size and EX40 compact.

In September 2024, though, Volvo officially abandoned those all-electric plans. The new goal is to have 90% of the lineup either EV or PHEV by 2030, meaning gas-powered engines will be in the picture for the foreseeable future, even if hybrids. On the most recent World EV Day, Volvo positioned PHEVs as the vehicle of now, trumpeting them as the perfect bridge to an eventual EV world.

Volvo hasn’t abandoned EVs, having just begun production on the much-anticipated ES90. It’s even lobbying Europe to ban new ICE vehicles by 2035. But in the meantime, Volvo is putting more effort into its gas-only fleet, such as significantly refreshing the XC90 crossover. It’s also hinted at moving the XC90 and XC60 production to the U.S. to avoid tariff costs.

Volkswagen

Like its fellow V marquee, Volkswagen initially talked a big game about EVs. In 2018, it said it would no longer build combustion engine cars by the end of 2026. Plenty of EVs have followed suit, like the ID.4 sedan and the long-awaited ID.Buzz minibus.

How times have changed. VW is putting plenty of resources into EVs, but gasoline cars aren’t going anywhere. In 2022, it revised its full-electric plans for Europe until 2033, and now it may not even hit that target. Then, in June 2024, the Volkswagen Group said it would pour $65 billion into internal combustion engine development to remain competitive with other brands. This year, VW assured customers that the famous Golf GTI hatchback will remain gas-powered until sometime into the 2030s, though it also hinted at a hybrid setup.

Other Volkswagen subsidiaries are following the same path. Porsche announced the current V8 Cayenne will be sold alongside the EV edition until at least 2030, and multiple other EVs like the 718 are reportedly delayed. Bentley has delayed its full transition from 2030 to 2035 and won’t release its first EV until 2027. Porsche, Bugatti, and Lamborghini are also exploring synthetic fuels as an EV alternative.

Other EV Rollbacks

Several other automakers don’t have enough news on their EV scale-backs for a full section, but are nonetheless worth mentioning. Here are five more companies that have modified their plans in the past two years.

Mercedes-Benz: Slow EV sales have caused the luxury automaker to pull back on its all-EV-by-2030 plans. Mercedes-Benz is also dropping the EQ badging and styling, keeping future EVs more in line with the overall brand aesthetic.

Honda: The Japanese automaker no longer has a timeline for electrifying a certain percentage of vehicles. For now, it will emphasize hybrids instead of EVs.

Aston Martin: The first Aston Martin EV has been postponed until 2027, and it will now sell ICE cars until the 2030s. That said, some Aston Martin models could be hybridized in the meantime.

Jaguar Land Rover: They originally were going to have six Land Rover EV models by the end of 2026, but now will only offer four by then. The Jaguar nameplate will remain electric-only for the time being.

Dodge: The electric future Dodge planned for the Charger has not worked out. After a change in management, Dodge has gone all-in on the HEMI V8, making it the only available engine in the Durango and hinting at plans to stuff it into the current Charger after clearly stating it would not.

The Changing Landscape of Vehicle Power

With how much time and money it takes for an automaker to implement any sort of strategy, major shifts aren’t taken lightly. The fact that so many manufacturers are retooling factories, extending ICE production life, and delaying vehicle launches shows how bumpy the road to EVs has gotten. I have a feeling there are many more chapters to be written in this story. Companies will follow the money, and who knows when or if the long-term money will point to an all-EV world.",https://www.autoinfluence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-EV-Rollback-2025-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Rally-Tan.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 10:20:11.856167

Overall, more than 1.4 million Texans cast a ballot this year according early totals from the Texas Secretary of State’s office. That’s just under 8% of the state’s nearly 18.5 million registered voters. By comparison, about 2.5 million Texans voted during the state’s last constitutional amendment election in 2023.

Read on for a breakdown of each proposition Texas voters gave the nod to this year — and what those changes might mean for you.

A variety of amendments to lower property taxes

Taxes were a primary focus of this year’s constitutional amendment election, accounting for more than half of the 17 amendments on the ballot. Of those proposals, six were directed at lowering property taxes for specific groups.

Most consequential among them are ballot Proposition 13, which increases the homestead exemption for all homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000, and Proposition 11 which gives senior citizens and those with disabilities an extra $60,0000 exemption.

The push to get this plan on the ballot was made by nearly all state lawmakers earlier this year. Taken together with other recent efforts to reduce property taxes, Texas will spend more than $50 billion on this during the state’s next budget cycle.

Additional amendments that passed are Proposition 10, which gives homeowners whose homes were destroyed by fires an exemption, as well as Proposition 7 that creates exemptions for widows of veterans whose death was a result of service.

Property taxes will also go down for landlords and business owners under Proposition 9.

Another measure — Proposition 17 — will give Texans who live along the southern border a property tax break for building projects on their land if they’re related to border security.

Texans make investments in water infrastructure, dementia prevention and technical education

Voters showed strong support for measures aimed at strengthening the state’s future. Proposition 1 creates two new funds to help Texas’ network of technical colleges grow — money that can be used toward buying land, building new classrooms and labs, repairing campus buildings and updating equipment.

Meanwhile, Proposition 4 will direct up to $1 billion a year for fixing old pipes, building reservoirs and shoring up the state’s water supply against future droughts. While supporters say it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed, the money will begin to address the state’s aging infrastructure.

And through Proposition 14, Texans approved the creation of a $3 billion investment to create a Dementia Prevention and Research Institute — modeled after the state’s cancer research program — to focus on Alzheimer’s and related diseases.

Additional tax exemptions and bans

Under Proposition 2, Texas voters banned a capital gains tax, a move supporters say protects investors and encourages economic growth. Meanwhile, Proposition 6 prohibits certain taxes on financial service providers like stock exchanges and broker dealers. While ultimately successful, more Texans voted against Prop 6 than any other proposal.

Voters also approved Proposition 8, which bans inheritance taxes in the state, ensuring lawmakers cannot impose a tax on estates or inheritances in the future, even though the state currently has none.

Finally, Proposition 5 creates a tax exemption for animal feed held in retailers’ inventories, an effort to lower livestock production costs and support Texas agriculture.

Tougher bail rules and judicial oversight

Amendments reshaping parts of the state’s criminal justice system also saw strong support from Texas voters.

Proposition 3 requires judges to deny bail in some violent and sexual offense cases if there’s clear evidence the person poses a danger or might flee — a move supporters say closes loopholes that’ve allowed repeat offenders to walk free.

Also approved was Proposition 12, which overhauls the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, giving it more power “to more effectively sanction judges for judicial misconduct” and change how its members are appointed. Supporters, like Gov. Greg Abbott, say the measure will make the judicial system more transparent.

How other amendments faired

Two other amendments focus on social and election issues. Proposition 15 puts parents’ rights directly into the state constitution, giving them more say over their kids’ education, healthcare and upbringing. Supporters say it protects families; critics worry it could complicate child welfare cases.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4589baf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fd0%2Ffbb101604aabb10bb164a605de3e%2Ftexacapitol-mm-2023.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:36.076783

Jharkhand needs around Jharkhand $256b from 2026 to 2070 to support its shift from fossil fuel-dominant sectors without disrupting the social infrastructure, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

“This shift entails phasing out carbon-intensive assets, building new low-carbon capacity, and mobilising unprecedented levels of capital,” said Shantanu Srivastava, IEEFA’s research lead, sustainable finance and climate risk and co-author of the report “Jharkhand’s Just Transition: A roadmap for economic growth and diversification.”

IEEFA said that the long-term benefits in terms of new revenues, jobs, and industrial ecosystems will far outweigh the significant upfront costs.

“Jharkhand’s vast renewable energy potential, combined with its industrial base and critical mineral reserves, positions the state to emerge as a hub for low-carbon manufacturing, ranging from EVs, solar panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) to green hydrogen production,” the report read.

“At the same time, natural farming and other, nature-based solutions can strengthen rural livelihoods, open opportunities in carbon markets, and enhance climate resilience,” it added.

The study noted that whilst public funds will play a catalytic role, most of the required financing will need to come from private investment, multilateral concessional capital and innovative blended finance structures. In return, this should be supported by clear and consistent policies to attract billions in private and concessional capital.

“Diversifying the state’s economy into new, low-carbon sectors will add to its GDP, contributing materially towards Jharkhand’s economic growth,” Srivastava says. “Thus, the transition will more than compensate for the state’s lost coal-based revenues.”

“This transition is both a high-risk challenge and a high-return opportunity.

The UK could add thousands of jobs, retain economic value and lead the world in energy with the right policies, collaborative action, and a focus on an integrated energy workforce, according to OEUK’s 2025 Workforce Insight.

Providing a blueprint for decision-makers and those navigating the expansion to a broader energy mix, OEUK presents the latest employment data and details steps to equip the workforce for its essential role in supporting a low-carbon economy across oil and gas, offshore wind, carbon capture & storage (CCS) and hydrogen.

Highlighting the potential to grow jobs, ensure good jobs and guard existing jobs, OEUK calls for timely intervention to support a robust domestic energy sector, warning that inaction will lead to an unprecedented exodus of supply chain capability, continued job losses, further loss of critical expertise, and hinder progress toward the UK’s net zero targets.

In the past year, more than 55% of the UK’s offshore energy firms have reduced their staff headcount according to a Pulse survey OEUK conducted in October 2025 to quantify the impact of the fiscal regime. Looking ahead, nearly 45% of surveyed companies are expecting to cut jobs further over the next 12 months if the current policy environment continues.

Ahead of the Budget, OEUK has urged the government to reform the fiscal regime to secure investment, safeguard jobs and strengthen the UK’s homegrown energy future, arguing that the choice is not between economic growth and climate ambition but how to deliver both.

Katy Heidenreich, OEUK’s supply chain and people director said:

“The government’s Clean Energy Jobs Plan presents an ambitious goal as the country works towards net zero emissions, energy security, and a strong economy. It’s vital that we ground ambition in reality. The windfall tax is costing jobs and investment and reducing tax revenues that support families, communities and vital services across the UK. Nine out of ten supply chain companies believe growing their business is only possible by finding new markets outside the UK. Many of the renewable energy sector jobs will not materialise before 2030 and we must act now to avoid losing the skilled people who are essential to achieving the UK’s climate ambition.

“We have an incredible opportunity, as we expand and diversify our energy mix across oil and gas, wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). We should build the energy jobs of the future on the shoulders of energy workers today.

“With the right policies and investment, the UK can achieve a net addition of jobs, growing the offshore energy workforce from 154,000 today to over 212,000 by 2030, with continued growth in oil and gas playing a central role. OEUK and its members are ready to lead but success depends on decisive action from government, industry and academia.”

The report addresses the common misconception that separate workforces exist for clean energy and oil and gas. Around 90% of the offshore energy workforce is employed by UK supply chain companies and most of these have expanded into and are already active across multiple energy sectors.

As a leading force in supporting strategic priorities for employment and skills, OEUK is committed to highlighting good practice and turning insight into action. OEUK’s Workforce Insight 2025 provides a blueprint for government and industry to deliver the energy jobs of the future. OEUK’s Calls to Action cannot be overstated: they are critical to unlocking growth, integrating the energy workforce, and ensuring the UK leads the world in clean, secure energy.

The Calls to Action are:

Grow Jobs: Unlock investment, expand the sector, and use energy workforce modelling to plan for the future.

Good Jobs: Embed fair pay, high standards, and inclusion across all energy sectors.

Guard Jobs: Retain skills, support new entrants, and protect communities.

Christopher Payne/Esto In a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars.","When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.

But dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.

Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto

Near the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.

Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto

That battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.

The episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.

Automakers roll with the punches because they have no choice

An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto

Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto

As with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.

To have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.

The factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.

Clearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.

Outside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.

An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto

Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto

Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto

“Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto

Smart, silent robots unload trucks

When those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.

An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto

“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.

Roach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.

Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto

Robots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.

Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto

“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”

Man’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.

Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto

Those four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.

At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto

From nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.

After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto

An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto

Merck, the German life sciences and electronics giant, has signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with SK Innovation E&S to supply 16 megawatts of renewable electricity capacity to its life science manufacturing sites in Daejeon and Songdo, South Korea.

The agreement represents the company's longest renewable energy commitment in the Asia-Pacific region and is scheduled to become operational in December 2027.

Once active, the PPA will deliver approximately 21,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, covering around 75% of the electricity demand for Merck's life science operations in South Korea.

What is a Power Purchase Agreement?

A Power Purchase Agreement (or PPA) is a long-term contract between an electricity generator and a buyer for the purchase of electricity. These agreements are often used to finance renewable energy projects, allowing businesses to buy power at a fixed price for a set period (often between 10 and 25 years) without having to build or operate their own power plants.

""This agreement reflects our long-term commitment to manufacturing sustainability,"" says Tim Jaeger, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer for Merck's Life Science business.

""By adding renewable electricity to the grid for our operations in South Korea, we are taking further measures to reduce our environmental impact and enabling our customers do the same.""

The deal forms part of Merck's expanding global renewable energy portfolio, which includes virtual PPAs across Europe and North America alongside various onsite installations worldwide.

Merck's 2030 sustainability targets

Merck's new agreement in South Korea will support the company's 2030 sustainability target of sourcing 80% of purchased electricity from renewable sources, a goal the firm now expects to hit well ahead of schedule.

Merck first established its group-wide sustainability strategy in 2020 and aligned all of its commitments with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, having its targets ratified by the SBTi along the way.

The strategy centres on three core commitments:

Advancing human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable science and technology by 2030

Fully integrating sustainability into value chains by 2030

Achieving climate neutrality whilst reducing resource consumption by 2040

Importantly, Merck's commitment to climate neutrality extends across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, with interim targets of a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030, compared to a 2020 baseline.

How is Merck performing against its targets?

Merck's 2024 data shows 182 metric kilotons of CO₂ equivalent in combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, representing a 43% reduction compared to 2020 levels.

However, Scope 3 emissions stood at 1,538 metric kilotons of CO₂ equivalent in 2024, marking only a 2% reduction from the 2020 baseline.

The disparity in progress between Scope 1 and 2 emissions versus Scope 3 emissions highlights the greater challenge companies face in reducing indirect emissions across their value chains compared to direct operational emissions.

Merck's broader sustainability framework includes commitments to sustainable product innovation, with a target for 10% of its portfolio to consist of 'Greener Alternative Products' by 2030.

The company employs SHAPE, its design for sustainability framework, alongside DOZN, a freely available online green chemistry evaluator tool, to assess and improve the sustainability profile of chemicals and products throughout their life cycle.

How Merck approaches supply chain sustainability

Beyond emissions reduction, Merck's sustainability strategy encompasses supply chain transparency and packaging improvements.

By 2030, the company aims for a 10% reduction in packaging weight per unit sales compared to baseline figures, with all new packaging designed following circularity principles and all fibre-based packaging sourced from deforestation-free materials.

The South Korea PPA adds renewable capacity directly to the grid, a model that differs from purely financial virtual PPAs by creating new clean energy infrastructure that benefits the broader electricity network.

This approach aligns with growing emphasis on ""additionality"" in corporate renewable energy procurement, where companies prioritise agreements that result in new renewable generation capacity rather than merely purchasing certificates from existing projects.

Merck generated sales of €21.2bn (US$24.4bn) across 65 countries in 2024, with operations spanning life science, healthcare and electronics sectors employing over 62,000 people globally.

The “Halliburton loophole” — part of comprehensive energy legislation Cheney guided from concept to signing ceremony in 2005 — is the most famous part of the bill. It may also be the most exaggerated.

Since it exempted fracking from a top environmental law, it’s been both credited and blamed for unleashing the flood of oil and gas production that put the United States at the top of the world’s leaderboard. The exemption bears the name of the oilfield services firm Cheney led before landing in the West Wing, but his specific role in putting it in law remains unclear 20 years later. In all those years he didn’t boast about it, nor did he disavow it.

The provision took fracking out of the hands of EPA before the agency, dreaded by the oil industry, could begin to regulate it in earnest. Cheney and the administration of then-President George W. Bush could reasonably take credit or blame for setting in motion oil, gas and coal policies that President Donald Trump now seeks to put in hyperdrive. Cheney’s death was announced Tuesday by his family. He was 84.

“From leading Halliburton to serving as vice president, he exemplified steady leadership and helped shape America’s energy and security,” American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a social media message.

The White House and Halliburton did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. While both men were avid supporters of the oil and gas industry, President Trump clashed with Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who helped lead a probe into Trump’s actions around the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

In addition to a long and storied career in government, Cheney had served as chair and CEO of Halliburton before joining Bush in the White House. It was the first time two oilmen held the top two jobs in the country. Bush had founded an oil exploration company early in his business career.

Bush and Cheney made a hard turn from the Democratic administration of former President Bill Clinton, who sought to build an environmental legacy late in his second term by preserving Western public lands and putting them off-limits to oil and gas development.

Bush campaigned on drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and increasing production on other public lands. “Drill, baby, drill,” though, didn’t become a Republican slogan until 2008, when the two oilmen were on their way out the door.

Bush was only nine days into his presidency when he assigned Cheney to develop a new national energy policy. The task force Cheney created for the job became famous for closed-door huddles with energy companies and a refusal to release records.

The report his panel produced some 108 days later drew howls from environmentalists and predictable praise from fossil fuel interests. But as much as it was a strong push to the right, it pales in comparison to Trump’s drive for fossil fuel “energy dominance” and renewable energy submission.

At the time, the United States produced a fraction of the oil and gas it does today, but Cheney’s report declared no unilateral emergencies and also advocated for renewable energy sources like wind and solar. It embodied the Republican side of the “all-of-the-above” rhetoric employed by both parties until Trump’s first term.

The aging document from the National Energy Policy Development Group provides hints of the drilling boom to come. The report mentioned hydraulic fracturing, with a faint nod to how important advances in the technology known as fracking would become.

It discussed fracking to produce natural gas from coal seams, which are far shallower than the deep formations that would be tapped in Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Texas in the drilling boom. It predicted fracking into coalbeds would most likely face added controls and costs to ensure environmental protection.

The document did not explicitly call for any exemption for fracking to be written into law.

Instead, the National Energy Policy Development Group said the Energy and Interior departments should “promote enhanced oil and gas recovery from existing wells through new technology.”

Energy Policy Act

Much of the report’s discussion about fracking sounded pretty milquetoast. Far more attention was paid to increased leasing and drilling on federal lands, primarily for gas.

The report pointed to the federal public lands of the Rocky Mountain West, saying 40 percent and some 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was restricted. The report recommended that the Interior Department take another look at those restrictions, still using careful federal language: “consistent with the law, good environmental practice, and balanced use of other resources.”

Federal public lands, then and now, produce far less oil than needed to meet American consumption. And those lands alone don’t produce enough natural gas to supply a massive export industry. Overall, the United States becamea net petroleum exporter in 2020, the last full year of Trump’s first term.

Still, it’s impossible to say that Cheney had no idea what might lay ahead. Halliburton had lobbied for an exemption from environmental restrictions for hydraulic fracturing when he ran the company. The Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. performed the first “frack job” on March 17, 1949.

By then, fracking pioneer George Mitchell had developed the “slickwater” mixture of horizontal drilling and high-pressure underground injection in Texas that would later drive the boom. But the promise of the technology wasn’t widely known. Mitchell would sell his company to Devon Energy in 2002 for about $3.5 billion.

Publicly, Cheney courted controversy at times. Environmentalists howled when he dismissed energy conservation as a “personal virtue,” but “not a sufficient basis” for comprehensive energy policy. But unlike Trump, he didn’t shut down any active offshore wind energy projects. And much of the Bush-Cheney energy agenda waited on Congress, while Trump has put the pedal down and left Congress in the dust.

It took four years, two wars and one presidential election after Cheney’s report was issued for Congress to produce the Energy Policy Act of 2005. While it extended the length of daylight saving time, observers say the effect of the rest of the bill is hard to measure.

The 550-page bill was packed with incentives for nuclear, fossil and renewable energy. There were grid reliability regulations and siting provisions later pushed aside by court decisions.

But one paragraph exempted hydraulic fracturing from the Underground Injection Control (UIC) provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The UIC regulations cover holes drilled to inject contaminants deep underground and wells used to force oil and gas to the surface.

Hydraulic fracturing was never widely regulated under the safe drinking water law. But in 1997, a federal appeals court had ruled that the UIC provisions of the law applied to fracturing in Alabama. The exemption in the 2005 law ended that and prevented the precedent from spreading to other states.

Opponents linked the exemption to Halliburton when the bill was debated in 2005. And Cheney’s former company became a target of critics during the Iraq war. In 2007, Halliburton unloaded its remaining interest in KBR, which was a major military contractor in Iraq.

The “Halliburton loophole” eventually stuck, though it doesn’t show up in the LexisNexis news archive in the context of oil and gas until May 2009.

As Mitchell’s slickwater shale drilling process revolutionized the American energy landscape and opposition grew, critics increasingly took to linking the exemption with Halliburton.

Some of those critics were quick to remember Tuesday how they viewed Cheney’s energy legacy.

“More than any other person Dick Cheney is responsible for the veil of secrecy and lies that surround fracking operations, and they are enshrined into law that he created,” Sandra Steingraber, senior scientist at the Science and Environmental Health Network, posted on social media.

The oil and gas industry has often said the fracking provision wasn’t even an exemption, much less a “loophole,” because EPA had not regulated fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act outside of Alabama.

“But tip your cap to the activists for constructing an entire mythology around it,” said Chris Tucker, who runs the energy practice in the strategic communications portion of FTI Consulting and helped develop the industry’s program for rapid response to fracking critics, known as Energy In Depth. “They had us on the defensive there for a while.”

Tucker is among those who say Cheney was not the driving force behind what the other side calls a loophole.

“The former vice president was just as surprised as anyone to have this thing, of all things, ascribed to him and his former company,” Tucker said. “It was one of those stories that was too good to check, I think.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2d/42/dca1df854429af018045d8fae159/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/96976160,N,,2025-11-05 09:59:30.421936

There’s a field near the airport in the tiny town of Hayden, Colorado, that may look like just a flat expanse of patchy grass and dirt. But exciting things are happening there—if you look below the surface.

“You wouldn't even be able to see our project,” said town manager Matthew Mendisco. “Because it's all underground, basically.”

That project is the start of a major geothermal energy network built earlier this year.

“We just completed the first phase,” Mendisco said. “We'll be entering the second, third, fourth phase over the next three years.”

This renewable, carbon-free technology will eventually heat and cool up to 800 thousand square feet across 20 buildings in the new business park the town is developing at the site. The town expects it to attract new businesses—and jobs—in industries from manufacturing to outdoor recreation. The idea is to help Hayden weather economic disruption as the nearby coal mine and related coal-fired power plant shut down, and the town transitions away from its traditional coal economy over the next few years.

“The business park was built by the town as a coal transition project to help boost jobs,” Mendisco said.

Town officials hope businesses moving into the development will create 75 permanent jobs in the community. An additional five permanent jobs will be tied to maintaining the geothermal network.

After considering the options, town leaders chose to equip the site with a campus-wide geothermal energy network. With multiple state and federal incentives for geothermal factored in, it made the most financial sense for the town. The network will allow them to provide extremely efficient and low-cost heating and cooling to potential business park tenants.

“Over time, we get to save them anywhere from 50 to 70% of their HVHC costs,” Mendisco said. “How do you bring business to a rural area? We had to try to be as competitive as possible at every development avenue.”

The system works by drilling a complex of boreholes in the ground, up to 1,000 feet deep, to tap into stable subterranean temperatures. Pipes circulate water between the borefield and the buildings in the network. Heat pumps in the buildings exchange thermal energy with the circulating water to regulate indoor air temperatures.

Thanks to many of the same incentives that supported the project in Hayden, these types of thermal systems appear set to take off across Colorado.

“There are dozens of feasibility and design studies happening right now,” said Lauren Suhrbier, the strategic development director at Clean Energy Economy for the Region (CLEER), a Northwest Colorado climate advocacy group.

Most of those projects are still in pre-development. But communities where they’re percolating are eager to usher their geothermal plans into reality.

“They have climate goals and they have very high utility bills,” Suhrbier said. “When you combine the two—we are looking to decarbonize and we have extremely high utility bills, and we have grant money, it’s kind of the perfect storm.”

To date, Colorado has doled out more than $23 million in geothermal incentives to communities from Durango to Joes, a small town on the eastern plains. The activity was spurred on by Governor Jared Polis’s “Heat Beneath Our Feet” geothermal initiative and a series of bills passed in the statehouse between 2022 and 2023. Policymakers support geothermal as an important climate solution and, crucially, a way to create jobs in communities like Hayden, in the process of transitioning away from the coal economy.

“There is potential for a lot of growth of jobs—high paying jobs,” Suhrbier said, though most of those jobs won’t materialize until more geothermal development starts breaking ground, which is likely to happen over the next few years.

Workers poached from fossil fuel

Right now, most geothermal companies fill their rosters by poaching workers with directly transferable skills from the fossil fuel and water well drilling industries. That means most of those high-paying geothermal jobs are done by people like Billy Baker, a driller who honed his skills over a 15-year career in the oilfields.

He left the oilfields a few months ago to take a job as a geothermal driller with Bedrock Energy, the company hired to build the network in Hayden. The pay is good, Baker said, a little better than the oil and gas wages he used to earn. The work is also interesting, and not far off from what he’s used to doing.

“It still uses the same skillset that was used in the previous oil and gas world,” Baker said. “It’s just much more stable and it's better for the environment. It feels better to be a part of it.”

But some in the geothermal world are concerned that the industry will eventually outgrow this ready-made skilled workforce. Under President Biden, the Department of Energy called for a dramatic expansion of geothermal drilling. The Trump administration has embraced it, too. Policymakers have identified workforce availability as a key obstacle.

“If you're looking to scale the industry rapidly, you just have this massive bottleneck that it's more or less impossible to pass people through,” said Andrew Iliff, the policy director at HEET, a Boston-based geothermal nonprofit.

According to Iliff, it takes years of experience to become a licensed driller, but so far, no one is intentionally cultivating that workforce outside.

“There is neither a particularly formal training process nor a particularly scalable one,” he said. “That is not set up to bring new entrants into the industry.”

Several industry groups, including HEET and the Geothermal Drillers Association, propose to solve the workforce pipeline problem by forming a network of Geothermal Drilling Centers of Excellence across the country. The vision is for a system of mobile geothermal education centers that could partner with unions, community colleges and other institutions to offer expertise along with credentials, to make geothermal training more accessible to industry newbies.

“If this takes off in the way that we hope that it will,” Iliff said. “Ten to 15 years from now, folks at technical high schools and community colleges see it as an option.”

That would be good for geothermal-forward communities like Hayden, where Mendisco says there will be plenty of geothermal construction work in the future. The town has big plans to expand well beyond its first project at the business park and hopes to convert all municipal buildings to geothermal heating and cooling.

The city recently established a municipal utility to be the central geothermal developer and operator in the area. Even private developers have started showing interest in connecting to publicly owned geothermal infrastructure.

Building that infrastructure could be an opportunity to tap into Hayden’s native workforce as part of the town’s coal transition activities.

“Coal transition means we're thinking long term about workers and skill sets,” Mendisco said. “We have some of the most amazing, hardworking people in our community that work at the power plant and coal mines. All their skills are transferable to come do this.”

As the coal transition generation turns over in the coming decades, job opportunities in the geothermal industry will continue gaining traction.

“I think about the economics of this all the time because we're trying to build a diverse economy,” Mendisco said.

Americans across parties and ages support converting coal plants into nuclear power plants. Q: How much would you support or oppose converting retired coal-fired power plants into nuclear power plants, if it could help provide cleaner and more reliable energy? Showing total for ""Strongly support"" and ""Somewhat support"". 1,003 national respondents. +/-3% margin of error.

Strong Support for Converting Retired Coal Plants Into Nuclear Facilities

In a striking sign of momentum, nearly three-quarters of Americans (73 percent) say they support repurposing retired coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities to deliver clean, reliable electricity. Support cuts across party lines, with a strong bipartisan consensus of 77 percent. Generationally, older adults (65+) lead the way at 78 percent support, with younger adults (18–24) close behind at 71 percent.

Rising Public Support for Nuclear Power

Public support for nuclear energy continues to rise nationwide. Nearly three in five Americans now favor nuclear power (58 percent), up from 49 percent in 2018. Support is particularly strong among Republicans (68 percent), males (66 percent), and older adults (65 percent).

Growing Support Across Motivations

Americans’ reasons for backing nuclear are broad and expanding. Reliability stands out as the top motivation, with 74 percent of respondents saying nuclear power generates electricity reliably. Other leading reasons include its ability to strengthen U.S. competitiveness, reduce pollution, and enhance energy independence. Support for these reasons has grown consistently since 2018, demonstrating durable bipartisan appeal.

Bipartisan Support for Nuclear R&D

Support for next-generation nuclear research and development remains strong, with nearly three in five Americans (58 percent) favoring increased federal investment. Among energy options, nuclear R&D shows the least partisan divide, underscoring common ground between Democrats and Republicans compared to more divisive sources like oil, coal, or natural gas.

Waning Concerns About Nuclear

Concerns about nuclear energy continue to decline across the political spectrum. While health and safety and waste disposal remain top issues, both have seen significant drops since 2018, particularly among Democrats and Independents. This downward trend suggests Americans are becoming more comfortable with nuclear as part of the clean energy transition.

“Public perception plays a major role in how energy technologies are chosen, but perception often deviates from scientific reality,” said Guido Nuñez-Mujica, director of data science for Anthropocene Institute. “That’s why we track perception: it should be informed by science, not shaped by scary movies, headlines, or PR from competing technologies. We conduct this survey every year to understand where public opinion stands so we can help align it with the facts and move toward evidence-based energy solutions.”

The deal could bring in between 1 trillion and 1.5 trillion won in yearly revenue for Samsung SDI.
Boost for Samsung SDI Amid weak financials Industry experts quoted in the report noted that the potential deal could significantly improve Samsung SDI’s performance following recent financial headwinds.
A long-term contract with Tesla, they say, would provide much-needed stability and position Samsung SDI more firmly in the expanding ESS market.
If both supply arrangements proceed, the combined contribution from Korean firms could total around 40 GWh annually for Tesla’s energy storage needs.","Samsung SDI is reportedly on the verge of sealing a major supply deal with Tesla worth about 3 trillion won (USD 2.1 billion), marking another milestone in the growing collaboration between the American electric vehicle giant and South Korean battery makers. The potential agreement underscores Tesla’s increasing shift toward Korean partners as the United States looks to reduce dependence on Chinese battery supply chains, according to a Korea Herald report.

Tesla executives finalize multi-Year deal

Sources cited in the report stated that Tesla executives from its Energy Storage Systems (ESS) division visited South Korea last week to finalize discussions with Samsung SDI. The companies are said to be closing in on a multi-year contract to supply around 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells annually, starting as early as 2026. The deal could bring in between 1 trillion and 1.5 trillion won in yearly revenue for Samsung SDI.

Production Planned at Indiana Facility

As per the report, the battery cells are expected to be manufactured at Samsung SDI’s joint venture facility with Stellantis in Indiana, US, which will reportedly convert part of its existing EV battery capacity to focus on ESS production. These cells are likely destined for Tesla’s Megapack assembly lines in California, where they’ll be integrated into the company’s large-scale energy storage systems.

Boost for Samsung SDI Amid weak financials

Industry experts quoted in the report noted that the potential deal could significantly improve Samsung SDI’s performance following recent financial headwinds. The company posted a 22.5% year-on-year revenue decline in Q3, with sales falling to 3.5 trillion won and recording an operating loss of 591.3 billion won. A long-term contract with Tesla, they say, would provide much-needed stability and position Samsung SDI more firmly in the expanding ESS market.

“Securing Tesla as a client would be a breakthrough moment for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a professor of automotive engineering at Daeduk University. “It will not only boost credibility but also help strengthen the company’s complete ESS portfolio, including solutions like the Samsung Battery Box for the US market.”

Korean battery makers strengthen grip

Samsung SDI’s domestic rival, LG Energy Solution (LGES), has already signed a deal with Tesla to supply 20 GWh of LFP ESS cells per year, with ongoing discussions to expand that volume by 50% to 30 GWh. If both supply arrangements proceed, the combined contribution from Korean firms could total around 40 GWh annually for Tesla’s energy storage needs.

The report further noted that Samsung SDI’s Indiana plant is currently underutilized, operating at less than 50% capacity due to a slowdown in the US EV market. Winning Tesla’s business could help maximize output from the joint facility, particularly as the demand for ESS systems accelerates globally.

Musk outlines chip roadmap

Meanwhile, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk recently commented on X (formerly Twitter) that the company’s next-generation AI5 and AI6 chips would be produced at both TSMC and Samsung, with high-volume production targeted for 2027. While unrelated to the battery deal, the comment reflects Tesla’s growing reliance on Samsung for advanced technology components.

Tesla’s pivot to Korean suppliers comes as part of a wider effort to diversify its sourcing away from China’s CATL, which has been its main provider of cost-efficient ESS batteries. Tesla’s Nevada plant, which uses CATL technology, currently delivers about 10 GWh annually — a small fraction of its target to scale ESS capacity to 100 GWh within the next three years.

The case will not only decide the fate of one of the president’s signature policies but will also carry far broader implications for presidential power over international trade and even climate policy.

If the Supreme Court rules for Trump, it will enable a future president to use tariffs to advance a wide range of domestic policy goals. Among other things, such a power would likely enable a president to unilaterally adopt a longstanding policy priority of the climate movement: a tariff on imported carbon-intensive products known as a carbon border adjustment.

The case Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump asks whether the his tariffs are legal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Congress passed the act in the late 1970s to empower presidents to use economic sanctions to address “unusual and extraordinary” national emergencies.

For nearly half a century, this power was used sparingly to impose targeted economic sanctions in response to discrete foreign threats, like prohibiting transactions with the Taliban and restricting enriched uranium.

That all changed after Trump returned to office this year. In April, Trump declared that “large and persistent annual U.S. good trade deficits” constitute “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy.”

This declaration provided the legal justification under the act for Trump to impose tariffs on virtually all imports. According to the Tax Foundation, the president’s tariffs will increase federal taxes this year by nearly $175 billion and reduce gross domestic product by 0.8 percent.

Trump’s use of the act is unprecedented in multiple ways, as my colleagues and I explain in a brief filed with the Supreme Court.

For one, no president had used the statute to enact a wide-ranging program covering nearly all imports. For another, no president had used the statute to impose tariffs, as the statute authorizes the president to “regulate” foreign transactions but does not reference taxation. Our brief argues that this lack of historical antecedent counsels against the president’s claim of such sweeping authority.

The case presents an early test of the Supreme Court’s approach to actions of the Trump administration that conflict with such longstanding conservative principles as limited government. But the case’s stakes extend well beyond the current White House occupant.

If the Supreme Court greenlights the president’s expansive use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, future administrations could use the statute to pursue other ambitious policy goals. A carbon border adjustment is a likely candidate.

Carbon border adjustments impose tariffs on imports based on their greenhouse gas emissions. This policy has multiple advantages, including reducing emissions from imported products and putting domestic producers on equal footing with foreign producers that do not invest in green practices.

The European Union enacted carbon border adjustments in 2023, and the idea is now catching on with Democrats and some Republicans in Congress seeing it as an opportunity to address climate change and boost domestic manufacturing.

But new legislation would be unnecessary if the Supreme Court sanctions the president’s broad tariff authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Under such a ruling, a president could declare that climate change generally — and the import of goods not subject to rigorous climate standards specifically — constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy” that triggers the law’s broad powers.

After all, the Defense Department has recognized that climate change has significant implications for U.S. national security, “increasing the risk that crises cascade beyond any one country or region.” Then, the president could “regulate” under the statute by imposing tariffs based on a product’s carbon footprint.

This may not be the optimal way to impose carbon border adjustments — if imposed by statute, rather than by presidential declaration, the policy would be more durable and democratic.

Nonetheless, the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for carbon border adjustments could have many benefits. The U.S. could negotiate reciprocal arrangements with allies to harmonize climate policies and embed climate considerations into the global trading system. Other countries may even adopt or strengthen climate-pollution standards.

But just because carbon adjustments are good policy does not mean they are authorized under a 50-year-old law aimed at international emergencies. In fact, as our brief explains, Trump’s claim to newfound and broad authority merits skepticism.

The Supreme Court will effectively decide in Learning Resources whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act confers such broad authority, and a win for Trump in that case could open up a new playbook for bold climate action.

Proponents of Trump’s expansive use of executive authority should learn from this example: Power once expanded is difficult to later confine. If the court blesses these new powers today, a future president could wield them for different very ends.

Chargers

Walmart deploys 400-kW Alpitronic HYC400 chargers (the company hinted at ABB as its second hardware supplier). The chargers feature two charging ports — one NACS (SAE J3400) and one CCS1 for maximum compatibility. It means that half of the stalls are CCS1 and the other are NACS.

We don’t have data about the number of stalls per location, but usually, there should be at least a few bays.

The Walmart app is essential for initiating a charging session and paying for charging (the payment method must be set for the user account). Pricing is displayed in the Walmart app before the start of the session (it varies by location and/or time of day) and remains locked for the duration of the session. So far, Walmart does not use credit card terminals.

Hungary, Slovakia and Poland voted against the agreement, despite other nations agreeing to key compromises including allowing flexibility for member states to buy carbon credits internationally to reach their emissions targets and for the EU to reassess its climate policy depending on economic performance.

“This is exactly the signal that Europe has to send in these times,” said Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari, who thanked Finland, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands for pushing for high emissions cuts in the debate.

Wopke Hoekstra, the European Commissioner for Climate, Net-Zero and Clean Growth, said the agreement is strong compared to those of allies in the Pacific, Europe and North America, but that some compromise was necessary amid current geopolitical and economic tension.

Texas’ independent grid is meeting a large portion of the state’s rising electricity demand through its growing fleet of solar facilities, wind power generators and batteries, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

In the first nine months of 2025, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) saw record demand on the grid compared with the same period in previous years.

The Texas grid also had the fastest electricity demand growth among US electric grids between 2024 and 2025, a trend expected to continue through next year. ERCOT is tracking more than 200 gigawatts of large load interconnection requests—large energy users like data centers and industrial facilities looking to connect and buy power from Texas’ wholesale electricity market.

Utility-scale solar has led the growing number of renewable energy sources helping ERCOT meet its skyrocketing demand. Together, wind and solar generation met more than one third of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of this year, according to the EIA.

Solar power has generated 45 terrawatt hours of electricity so far this year—50 percent more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021.

The availability of solar generation in ERCOT also has reduced the need for gas-fired generation during midday hours, according to the EIA. This energy production comes despite attempts by some Texas lawmakers earlier this year to restrict renewable development across the state.

For Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, ERCOT’s growing share of renewables shows that it’s the preferred resource type when an energy market is open, like Texas’ deregulated market.

“People are going to build solar and wind, and now battery storage, essentially as quickly as they possibly can,” Wamsted said. “It’s economic—it is what customers want.”

ERCOT has become the place to build power projects quickly in the US. Because it’s the grid with the fastest interconnection process, developers are able to get projects online within a few years.

The friendly regulatory environment has made it the norm for some generators to not only sell to the ERCOT market, but to also sell their power privately to companies through power purchase agreements. It allows both the generator and the company to lock in a price, offering them both cost security for years from an otherwise shifting ERCOT market. These options make ERCOT the grid to build renewables in bulk, Wamsted said.

“It wouldn’t be happening if they weren’t also reliable and cost effective,” Wamsted said of renewables. “Nobody’s running out to build something that’s overpriced and can’t be counted on.”

Throughout the next five years, supply should be able to keep up with the quick pace of demand coming to ERCOT, said Nathalie Limandibhratha, BloombergNEF’s US power analyst. But BloombergNEF’s forecasts show that in 10 years, Texas’ supply will no longer be able to keep up. There will be an imbalance if demand continues to march on at the same pace, said Limandibhratha.

While solar and storage are expected to maintain similar growth rates, part of the supply shortfall is due to the decline of thermal energy additions after 2030, Limandibhratha said. Meanwhile, in the last year, BloombergNEF’s forecast for solar and storage was revised upward significantly as the market moves quickly, she said.

While natural gas remains the largest source of electricity within ERCOT, meeting 43 percent of 2025 demand, its generation has flattened in recent years, according to the EIA. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2024, natural gas powered 47 percent of the state’s electricity.

Wind generation this year through September totaled 87 terrawatt hours, up 4 percent compared to the same period in 2024 and 36 percent since 2021. This growth comes despite political headwinds against the resource type. In the first days of his second term, President Donald Trump pledged to end new developments of wind energy, and his administration has since taken numerous steps to block projects.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TexasSolar.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-05 09:59:49.262506

A new study from researchers at Northern Arizona University and Duke University tackles this claim head-on. The research, published in the journal PLOS Climate, confirms the “upfront carbon cost” of an EV is real, but finds that it’s completely erased after just two years of driving. This matters because it provides a clear break-even point, showing that over a vehicle’s lifetime, a gas-powered car causes at least twice as much environmental damage as an EV.

The researchers didn’t shy away from the messy side of EV production. They analyzed the energy-intensive manufacturing process, including the mining of lithium for batteries. Their analysis found that in the first two years, an EV is indeed responsible for 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than a gasoline vehicle. This initial carbon “debt” is the core of the skeptical argument against EVs.

The study’s crucial finding, however, is how quickly that debt is paid. According to study co-author and Duke professor Drew Shindell, while there is a bigger footprint in the “very short term,” an EV driver “very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three.” After that break-even point, the EV is “far ahead” for the rest of its life, resulting in a “cumulatively much lower carbon footprint.” The researchers’ models found that over their entire lifespans, gasoline vehicles cause at least double the environmental harm of their electric counterparts.

The researchers didn’t just look at today’s power grid; they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption and clean energy growth through 2050. They found that the EV’s environmental advantage is set to widen significantly as solar and wind power replace fossil fuels. “When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” Shindell said. This means that as the grid gets cleaner, so does every EV that’s plugged into it.

This research lands at a challenging time for EVs in the United States. The study’s authors note that while their findings show a “really clear way” to reduce climate change and air pollution, the current administration’s policies are “really misguided.” President Donald Trump has reversed the previous administration’s 2030 EV targets, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for EV purchases. While outside experts noted the study didn’t address the separate issue of battery recycling or disposal, its central conclusion directly contradicts the policy push for fossil fuels, confirming that the switch to EVs is a key strategy for decarbonizing transportation.",https://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/researchers-find-electric-cars-erase-their-carbon-debt-in-under-two-years.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 09:18:14.315229

The deal among nearly 200 nations offered a potential “turning point for the world,” then-U.S. President Barack Obama said. Eventually, almost every country on Earth signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, a pact whose success would rest on peer pressure, rising ambition and the economics of a clean energy revolution.

But 10 years later, the actions needed to fulfill those hopes are falling short.

The United States has quit the deal — twice. President Donald Trump is throttling green energy projects at home and finding allies to help him undermine climate initiatives abroad, while inking trade deals that commit countries to buying more U.S. fossil fuels.

Europe remains on track to meet its climate commitments, but its resolve is wavering, as price-weary voters and the rise of far-right parties raise doubts about how quickly the bloc can deliver its pledge to turn away from fossil fuels.

Paris has helped ingrain climate change awareness in popular culture and policy, led countries and companies to pledge to cut their carbon pollution to zero and helped steer a wave of investments into clean energy. Scientists say it appears to have lessened the odds of the most catastrophic levels of warming.

On the downside, oil and gas production hasn’t yet peaked, and climate pollution and temperatures are still rising — with the latter just tenths of a degree from the tipping point agreed in Paris. But the costs of green energy have fallen so much that, in most parts of the world, it’s the cheapest form of power and is being installed at rates unthinkable 10 years ago.

World leaders and diplomats who are in Brazil starting this week for the United Nations’ annual climate talks will face a test to stand up for Paris in the face of Trump’s opposition while highlighting that its goal are both necessary and beneficial.

The summit in the Amazonian port city of Belém was supposed to be the place where rich and poor countries would celebrate their progress and commit themselves to ever-sharper cuts in greenhouse gas pollution.

Instead, U.S. contempt for global climate efforts and a muddled message from Europe are adding headwinds to a moment that is far more turbulent than the one in which the Paris Agreement was adopted.

Some climate veterans are still optimists — to a point.

“I think that the basic architecture is resistant to Trump’s destruction,” said John Podesta, chair of the board of the liberal Center for American Progress, who coordinated climate policy under Obama and former President Joe Biden. But that resistance could wilt if the U.S. stays outside the agreement, depriving the climate movement of American leadership and support, he said.

“If all that’s gone, and it’s gone for a long time, I don’t know whether the structure holds together,” Podesta added.

Other climate diplomats say the cooperative spirit of 2015 would be hard to recreate now, which is why acting on Paris is so essential.

“If we had to renegotiate Paris today, we’d never get the agreement that we had 10 years ago,” said Rachel Kyte, the United Kingdom’s special climate representative.

“But we can also look to these extraordinary data points, which show that the direction of travel is very clear,” she said, referring to growth of clean energy. “And most people who protect where their money is going to be are interested in that direction of travel.”

The Paris paradox

One thing that hasn’t faded is the business case for clean energy. If anything, the economic drivers behind the investments that Paris helped unleash have surpassed even what the Paris deal’s authors anticipated.

But the political will to keep countries driving forward has stalled in some places as the United States — the world’s largest economy, sole military superpower and historically biggest climate polluter — attacks its very foundation.

Trump’s attempts to undermine the agreement, summed up by the 2017 White House slogan “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” has affected European ambitions as well, French climate diplomat Laurence Tubiana told reporters late last month.

“I have never seen such aggressivity against national climate policy all over because of the U.S.,” said Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement. “So we are really confronted with an ideological battle, a cultural battle, where climate is in that package the U.S. government wants to defeat.”

The White House said Trump is focused on developing U.S. oil and engaging with world leaders on energy issues, rather than what it dubs the “green new scam.” The U.S. will not send high-level representatives to COP30.

“The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda,” said Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Trump is not the only challenge facing Paris, of course.

Even under Obama, the U.S. insisted that the Paris climate pollution targets had to be nonbinding, avoiding the need for a Senate ratification vote that would most likely fail.

But unlike previous climate pacts that the U.S. had declined to join, all countries — including, most notably, China — would have to submit a pollution-cutting plan. The accord left it up to the governments themselves to carry out their own pledges and to push laggards to do better. An unusual confluence of political winds helped drive the bargaining.

Obama, who was staking part of his legacy on getting a global climate agreement, had spent the year leading up to Paris negotiating a separate deal with China in which both countries committed to cutting their world-leading pollution.

France, the host of the Paris talks, was also determined to strike a worldwide pact.

In the year that followed, more than 160 countries submitted their initial plans to tackle climate change domestically and began working to finish the rules that would undergird the agreement.

“The Paris Agreement isn’t a machine that churns out ambition. It basically reflects back to us the level of ambition that we have agreed to … and suggests what else is needed to get back on track,” said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and a negotiator for the United Kingdom during the Paris talks. “Whether countries do that or not, it’s essentially then a matter for them.”

Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former environment minister and a lead negotiator of the Paris Agreement’s carbon crediting mechanism, called the deal an “incredible feat” — but not a self-executing one.

“The problem is now it’s really up to countries as well as cities, regions, companies and financial institutions to act,” she said. “It’s not a treaty thing anymore — it’s now, ‘Do the work.’”

When green turns gray

Signs of discord are not hard to find around the globe.

China is tightening its grip on clean energy manufacturing and exports, ensuring more countries have access to low-cost renewables, but creating tensions in places that also want to benefit from jobs and revenue from making those goods and fear depending too much on one country.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former United Nations climate envoy, eliminated his country’s consumer carbon tax and is planning to tap more natural gas to toughen economic defenses against the United States.

The European Union spent the past five years developing a vast web of green regulations and sectoral measures, and the bloc estimates that it’s roughly on track to meet those goals. But many of the EU’s 27 governments — under pressure from the rising far right, high energy prices, the decline of traditional industry and Russia’s war against Ukraine — are now demanding that the EU reevaluate many of those policies.

Still, views within the bloc diverge sharply, with some pushing for small tweaks and others for rolling back large swaths of legislation.

“Europe must remain a continent of consistency,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after a meeting of EU leaders in October. “It must step up on competitiveness, but it must not give up on its [climate] goals.”

Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, in contrast, said after the same meeting that he felt vindicated about his country’s long-standing opposition to the EU’s green agenda: “In most European capitals, people today think differently about these exaggerated European climate ambitions.”

Worldwide, most countries have not submitted their latest carbon-cutting plans to the United Nations. While the plans that governments have announced mostly expand on their previous ones, they still make only modest reductions against what is needed to limit Earth’s warming since the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Exceeding that threshold, scientists say, would lead to more lives lost and physical and economic damage that would be ever harder to recover from with each tenth of a degree of additional warming.

The U.N.’s latest report showing the gap between countries’ new pledges and the Paris targets found that the world is on track for between 2.3 and 2.5 degrees of warming, a marginal difference from plans submitted in 2020 that is largely canceled out when the U.S. pledge is omitted. Policies in place now are pointing toward 2.8 degrees of warming.

“We need unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions now in an ever-compressing timeframe and amid a challenging geopolitical context,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

But doing so also makes sense, she added. “This where the market is showing that these kind of investments in smart, clean and green is actually driving jobs and opportunities. This is where the future lies.”

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a video message Tuesday that overshooting the 1.5-degrees target of Paris was now inevitable in the coming years imploring leaders to rapidly roll out renewables and stop expanding oil, gas and coal to ensure that overshoot was short-lived.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.

Greenhouse gas pollution hasn’t fallen, and action has flat lined even as climate-related disasters have increased.

“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test. Can this agreement move forward under the weight of all of these challenges?” Hare asked. “If it can’t do that, governments are going to be asking about the benefits of it, frankly.”

That doesn’t mean all is lost.

In 2015, the world was headed for around 4 degrees Celsius of warming, an amount that researchers say would have been devastating for much of the planet. Today, that projection is roughly a degree Celsius lower.

“I think a lot of us in Paris were very dubious at the time that we would ever limit warming to 1.5,” said Elliot Diringer, a former climate official who led the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’ international program during the Paris talks.

“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “I think the answer is yes. Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”

Green technology defying expectations

In addition, the adoption of clean energy technology has moved even faster than projected — sparking what one climate veteran has called a shift in global climate politics.

“We are no longer in a world in which only climate politics has a leading role and a substantial role, but increasingly, climate economics,” said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015. “Yes, politics is important; no longer as important as it was 10 years ago.”

Annual solar deployment globally is 15 times greater than the International Energy Agency predicted in 2015, according to a recent analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a U.K. nonprofit.

Renewables now account for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added globally every year, BloombergNEF reported. China is deploying record amounts of renewables and lowering costs for countries such as Brazil and Pakistan, which has seen solar installations skyrocket.

Even in the United States, where Trump repealed many of Biden’s tax breaks and other incentives, BloombergNEF predicts that power companies will continue to deploy green sources, in large part because they’re often the fastest source of new electricity.

Costs for wind and batteries and falling, too. Electric vehicle sales are soaring in many countries, thanks in large part to the huge number of inexpensive vehicles being pumped out by China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV-maker.

Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.

“Today, you can actually talk about deploying clean energy technologies just because of their cost competitiveness and ability to lower energy system costs,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the research institution Energy Innovation. “You don’t actually even have to say ‘climate’ for a lot of them, and that just wasn’t true 10 years ago.”

The economic trends of the past decade have been striking, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy who negotiated the Paris Agreement.

“Paris is something that was seen all over the world, seen by other countries, seen in boardrooms, as the first time in more than 20 years when you finally got heads of government saying, ‘Yes, let’s do this,’” he said. “And that’s not the only reason why there was tremendous technological development, but it sure didn’t hurt.”

Still, limits exist to how far businesses can take the clean energy transition on their own.

“You need government intervention of some kind, whether that’s a stick or a carrot, to push the economy towards a low-carbon trajectory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “If governments press the brakes on climate action or seriously start to soft pedal, then it does have a limiting effect.”

Brazil, the host of COP30, says it wants to demonstrate that multilateralism still works and is relevant to peoples’ lives and capable of addressing the climate impacts communities around the world are facing.

But the goal of this year’s talks might be even more straightforward, said Guilanpour, the former negotiator.

“If we come out of COP30 demonstrating that the Paris Agreement is alive and functioning,” he said, “I think in the current context, that is pretty newsworthy of itself.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2f/05/0e5a211d4a9aa51b3c6077b4d94c/trump-climate-paris-agreement-03855.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 07:18:47.512863

Gov. Mike Braun has pledged to be the entrepreneurial governor, but that vision will require reliable, affordable electricity to come to fruition, and the infrastructure to carry it.

That means building more power plants and the transmission lines needed to transport the electrons to economic demand centers. But while Indiana and other Midwestern stakeholders have engaged in a years-long evaluation of infrastructure solutions to meet the region’s needs, culminating in a transmission portfolio that will deliver historic benefits, out-of-state interests are now seeking to block the very development needed to enable entrepreneurial growth.

The Midwestern grid operator (MISO) is a national leader in transmission planning and has developed a plan to meet the region’s needs. After 300 meetings and 40,000 hours of staff time in development, MISO approved a portfolio of power lines in late 2024 that will help ensure reliable, affordable power for decades to come. That decision followed rounds of feedback and expansive stakeholder outreach among the states in the region, including Indiana.

All told, the portfolio is expected to deliver $72 billion in net benefits over the power lines’ first two decades in service, saving residents up to $3 for every dollar invested. In Indiana, the projects are expected to create upwards of 7,100 direct local jobs and spur up to $2.6 billion in total economic output.

Opposition states

Yet the public service commissions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Montana filed a federal complaint seeking to derail the portfolio, arguing MISO used a flawed cost-benefit analysis. The filing comes nearly eight months after the grid operator approved the portfolio and nearly two years after planning was underway with the methodology in question. Notably, the southern states will not pay for the projects, as their costs will be distributed only among the states where they are constructed.

This complaint serves only as an attempted roadblock to halt the projects Indiana needs. Our governor has warned that the state does not have enough power to meet growing demand. And power bills are skyrocketing. From 2024 to 2025, Indiana families saw a 17.5% increase on their monthly power bill, about $28 more on average.

Constructing these lines is critical to positioning Midwestern states to “attract investment, create jobs, and maintain leadership in emerging technologies and industrial innovation,” as Indiana’s Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told federal regulators. She also touted Indiana’s steadfast support of the portfolio, acknowledging it will avoid “costly inefficiencies” and enable access to all generation resources across the Midwest.

These resources are critical to sustaining economic growth. With manufacturing comprising more than 26% of the state’s GDP, Indiana’s industrial sector is the greatest electricity-consuming industry. Our state is the national leader in steelmaking as well as vehicle manufacturing, having produced about 84% of recreational vehicles sold in 2023. Further growth in these energy-intensive sectors will require considerably more electricity. But without additional transmission capacity, that growth could strain the grid, resulting in even higher electricity prices and increased risk of power outages. Building a well-planned grid is imperative to meeting challenges for decades to come.

Enabling big business for the future will require smart infrastructure decisions now. Continued investment depends upon the availability of reliable, affordable electricity that will help ensure Indiana remains an attractive place for entrepreneurial leaders.

Ultimately, Indiana joined other Midwestern stakeholders to craft a plan that will serve our collective needs. Hoosier leaders are committed to ensuring reliable, affordable, secure power, and the federal government has no business stepping in the way of our forward progress. While other states may choose alternative energy solutions, Indiana remains committed to building a grid that will enable economic prosperity well into the future.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/electrical-pylons.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 12:14:14.093523

SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced it has started installation of its 5 MW electrolyzer for the H2 Hollandia project, the first decentralized green hydrogen hub initiative currently under construction in the Netherlands. Developed by Novar and Avitec, the project links the 115-MWp Vloeivelden Hollandia solar park directly to a Plug electrolyzer system, establishing a new model and serving as a path for localized, small and midscale renewable hydrogen production.

The electrolyzer at H2 Hollandia produces green hydrogen without placing any additional burden on the electricity grid. Because the system is directly connected to the adjacent solar farm, it can convert surplus solar generation, energy that would otherwise be curtailed, into hydrogen that can be stored and distributed for use in transport and industry

The project broke ground in early September and is scheduled to be operational in 2026. Upon completion, H2 Hollandia will be the first operational electrolyzer hydrogen hub in the Netherlands producing entirely green hydrogen and delivering roughly 300,000 kilograms annually for sustainable mobility and industrial use across the region.

“H2 Hollandia is a powerful example of how renewable energy and hydrogen production can be seamlessly integrated at scale,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and Chief Revenue Officer of Plug. “The project demonstrates how Plug’s electrolyzer technology can help relieve grid congestion, strengthen energy resilience, and accelerate industrial decarbonization. This project is an important step in our broader European expansion, as we continue deploying commercial-scale systems that make clean hydrogen production both practical and scalable.”

“Plug’s electrolyzer technology is a key enabler of H2 Hollandia’s vision,” said H2 Hollandia representative. “By directly integrating Plug’s system with our solar park, we’re able to convert renewable energy into green hydrogen without adding stress to the grid. This is critical to realizing the Netherlands’ hydrogen hub ambitions. This collaboration shows what’s possible when advanced technology and strong regional partnerships come together to accelerate our clean energy transition.”

H2 Hollandia reflects the Dutch government’s broader hydrogen strategy, where public-policy support and regional cooperation join to advance the Netherlands as a major hydrogen hub in Northwest Europe. Clean hydrogen is essential to the energy transition, enabling new jobs, improved air quality, and reduction of carbon emissions across industry, mobility, and infrastructure. Through this approach, the region is building one of the Netherlands’ most advanced clean-energy ecosystems, positioning local industry, transport, and utilities to meet the Dutch government’s targets for hydrogen deployment, infrastructure readiness, and achieving long-term climate neutrality.

For Plug Power, the project marks a significant expansion of its presence in the Netherlands and follows the company’s ongoing operations at the Green Box facility in Hengelo, where Plug operates a demonstration site showcasing its PEM electrolyzer and integrated hydrogen systems. With H2 Hollandia now entering the installation phase, Plug transitions from demonstration to full commercial deployment in one of Europe’s most dynamic hydrogen markets. Plug Power continues to build a fully integrated hydrogen ecosystem—from production and storage to distribution and power generation—to help customers and partners achieve their business and sustainability objectives across industrial, transportation and energy sectors in North America and Europe.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions.
Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide.
People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.
With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When summer heat comes to the Arara neighborhood in northern Rio, it lingers, baking the red brick and concrete that make up many of the buildings long after the sun has gone down. Luis Cassiano, who’s lived here more than 30 years, says he’s getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.

In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning — Cassiano is one — can’t always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor’s, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.

“The sun in the summer nowadays is scary,” Cassiano said.

As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.

All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.

That’s why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.

“I am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts

It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.

People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.

They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.

“It’s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don’t have savings, that’s really devastating,” Brandon said.

Crop yields suffer in many places, but worst in poor countries

Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.

But poorer countries will be more severely affected, said Heriberto Tapia, head of research and strategic partnerships advisor at the UNDP Human Development Report Office.

Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.

Most of the world’s 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.

Elouafi thinks technology can help ease the climate pressure on many of those farmers, but also noted that many can’t afford it. She’s not confident that this year’s COP will provide enough money to help with that.

Will holding COP30 in the Global South make a difference?

Brazilian officials thought Belem, on the edge of the Amazon and not a rich city, would be a forceful reminder for negotiators of the difficulty that climate change and rising extreme weather are bringing to millions of people every day.

“I heard there were a lot of negotiators who have been complaining of being put on a bunk bed, or in terms of sharing a room, but this is the reality of most people around the world,” said Nafkote Dabi, climate policy lead at global development organization Oxfam. “So I think it makes things real.”

But some experts were skeptical, despite the recent UNDP report saying the need to take action is urgent.

“I wish that they had said more about what exactly is the rapid action that needs to be taken, because I don’t think rapid action is going to come out of COP,” said Kimberly Marion Suiseeya, an associate professor at Duke University who studies how international policies impact people in rural and forested areas.

With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?

Although the public narrative has long been that humankind has generally been making progress on alleviating poverty, numbers show that now there’s a “stagnation,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the Human Development Report Office at the UNDP. “The numbers are high and they are not budging.”

In a memo ahead of COP30, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called for a shift from prioritizing reducing emissions to focus on reducing human suffering. On climate change, “there’s no apocalyptic story for rich countries,” he said. “The place where it gets really tough is in these poor countries.”

But Conceição said it’s wrong to think about poverty reduction and climate as a tradeoff.

The idea that climate is only a future problem, “or it’s about things out there like glaciers melting, needs to be completely thrown out and replaced with the notion that actually the two agendas are one and the same,” he said.

Want to learn more about navigating the future of critical minerals supply chains?","Key takeaways:

Canada’s critical minerals strategy under Defence Production Act: New policies guarantee buyers for domestic producers and hint at government-backed price floors to counter China’s supply chain dominance

C$6.4 billion investment in 26 mining projects: Funding supports extraction, processing and battery technology, with offtake deals for graphite, scandium, and rare earths

Global push for secure supply chains: Canada joins G7 allies in reducing reliance on China, with potential for a ‘buyers’ club’ and coordinated pricing benchmarks

The announcement, made at last week’s G7 Energy and Environment Summit in Toronto, reflects growing concern among Western nations about China’s dominance in the critical minerals supply chain, where it still accounts for roughly 70% of global refining capacity.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson outlined a first round of C$6.4 billion ($4.56 billion) G7 investment across 26 Canadian mining projects, aimed at supporting both extraction and downstream processing.

This includes offtake agreements with Rio Tinto at its scandium plant in Sorel-Tracy in Quebec and with Northern Graphite at its Lac des Iles graphite project near Montreal, Quebec. There’s also investment in rare earths and nickel and lithium-ion battery technology, as well as recycling.

While government offtake prices are being kept confidential, policymakers have hinted that future rounds could include guaranteed or floor-price mechanisms designed to give producers stronger long-term certainty.

The Canadian move comes amid heightened global attention on securing critical minerals, including for national security and defence. By combining direct investment, offtake arrangements and potential price support measures, Canada’s strategy aims to signal to investors that long-term domestic projects can be bankable despite competition from lower-cost Chinese producers.

The timing of the announcement also coincides with similar efforts in the United States and European Union, where governments are exploring subsidies, tax incentives and strategic stockpiles to reduce reliance on single-source suppliers.

For minerals such as scandium, which have historically faced small, volatile markets and high barriers to entry, the improvement to financing conditions could be immense. The policy is also seen as part of a broader international effort to reduce reliance on China, with preliminary discussions under way for a G7 ‘buyers’ club’ to coordinate procurement and potentially establish common pricing benchmarks among allied nations.

Demand-side projections further underline the stakes. Analysis by the Canadian Climate Institute estimates domestic demand for critical minerals could reach C$16 billion annually by 2040, driven by battery manufacturing, electric vehicle production, and clean energy infrastructure.

That surge in demand is creating pressure to secure a reliable, locally-controlled supply chain – particularly for minerals where Canada has known deposits but has historically lacked processing capacity.

Implications for producers and investors

For producers and investors, the key question is whether these initiatives will translate into accelerated project timelines. The combination of government-backed capital and offtake agreements could reduce risk for early-stage projects, allowing developers to move more quickly from exploration to production.

Challenges remain – environmental permitting, community consultations and technological hurdles could slow deployment even with financial incentives – but the bigger picture is positive.

As more allied nations roll out similar measures, more global supply sources could come online, easing China’s dominance and giving Canada and its partners new openings to scale quickly.

For the broader industry, the policy introduces a new layer of complexity. If implemented, guaranteed prices could anchor domestic production – but they may also affect global pricing dynamics if other G7 nations follow suit.

While offtake deals won’t establish tradable benchmarks, they could steady price expectations and encourage project financing – especially if allied governments adopt similar arrangements.

The key now will be how quickly projects move from exploration to production, and whether Canada’s approach can attract sufficient private capital to complement government support.

Perhaps more importantly, Canada’s strategy highlights a key trend: Western governments are increasingly willing to intervene directly in strategic mineral markets, signalling a shift from traditional laissez-faire commodity policies toward security-driven industrial planning.

For investors and producers in the sector, the next several years could be characterised by a flurry of activity as governments, miners and allied nations test the limits of this coordinated approach.

Instead, prices of renewable energy plummeted and utilities readied plans to close coal plants.
Proponents of fossil fuel generation insist that coal plants will be needed for baseload generation.
Two former PUC commissioners have also weighed in to support delayed retirements of coal plants.
In electricity, Colorado remains much like an island, with limited transmission to other utilities in the West.","This story was originally published by Big Pivots.

During the last decade, plans were made to retire two coal-burning units in Colorado, one in Pueblo and the other in Craig, by the end of 2025.

Now, those retirements are in doubt. It’s possible — some think likely — that in December the federal government will order utilities to continue operating the two coal units in 2026.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the electrical provider for 15 cooperatives in Colorado, operates Craig 1. In an interview on Oct. 7, Duane Highley, the chief executive, said he had a “high degree of confidence, based on what I’m hearing from them today, that unless something changes, we are going to get an order to keep Craig 1 open past the end of the year.”

Highley had just returned from Washington, D.C., and meetings with officials from both the Department of Energy and the Energy Dominance Council.

On Oct. 29, Highley affirmed the same information. “I just talked with the White House this morning, and it’s still progressing.”

Xcel Energy owns and operates Comanche 2. In late August, Pueblo County announced it was seeking federal intervention to keep it operating. On Oct. 31, U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, whose congressional district encompasses both Craig and Pueblo, sent a letter to the Department of Energy asking it to order the plant to remain open beyond December. The letter also asks the DOE to order Xcel to operate Comanche 3 at full capacity until sufficient replacement generation is online.

Unlike Pueblo County’s request, which was couched as “just transition,” Hurd’s request was premised in the argument that the unit is needed for reliability.

Salient in Hurd’s letter was this statement: Xcel has “warned in formal filings that the state’s current resource plan does not meet industry standard reliability metrics.”

On Oct. 24, in brief remarks in Pueblo, Hurd had signaled that would be his argument.

“We’re facing a real reliability crisis here in Colorado,” he said.

He went on to say he hoped that Gov. Jared Polis and his administration would recognize that and agree to extend the life of Comanche 2 in light of the unexpected downtime for Comanche 3 in coming months.

“We have a reliability crisis, not only because the demand is going up, but also because unit 3 is down,” he said.

Does a reliability crisis truly exist in Colorado? If so, what caused it? And is federal intervention justified? In other words, has Colorado’s regulation of Xcel fallen short in some fundamental way, as Hurd’s letter and remarks suggest. Or instead, might this be a manufactured crisis, a ploy in the high-stakes poker game between regulators and the regulated?

Trump uses seldom-invoked law

The Trump administration clearly wants to keep coal plants operating. In September, for example, the Department of Energy announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry.”

Part of that mission has been to delay retirement of coal plants or, in some cases, reopen them. This law may will be most pertinent to Colorado.

In late May, the Department of Energy cited a seldom-used provision in the Federal Power Act called 202(c) in ordering the 1,420-megawatt J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to remain open a week before its scheduled closing. A week later, it cited the same law in ordering an oil-and-gas electrical plant near Philadelphia to continue operations. The plant was one day from closing.

The 1935 law, according to the Georgetown University Law Center, permits the use of emergency authority for only 90 days in the event of war, because of a sudden increase in the demand for electricity, or because of a shortage of electricity. The Department of Energy cited energy shortages as justification for use of 202(c) powers in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

The Georgetown center said such 202(c) orders had not previously been used by the federal government in violation of what the regional grid operator wanted. Colorado has no true grid operator, although Xcel Energy is one of two balancing authorities, The Western Area Power Administration is the other.

E&E News by Politico reported in a Sept. 25 story that the Trump administration was also considering use of a different law, the Defense Production Act, to justify continued operation of mostly uneconomical coal power plants operating across the country.

The same publication on Oct. 28 reported that the DOE had solicited outside legal expertise in “statutory interpretation, regulatory analysis, and challenges to agency actions under the Federal Power Act.” The budget for this outside legal help could run to $50 million.

In Pueblo on Oct. 24, at an Action Colorado conference, Hurd reported talking with Xcel Energy folks at the Comanche plant earlier that morning. They told him that demand that had been growing about 0.5% a year now has been projected to rise between 3% and 7%. That stress, said Hurd, a former attorney for Delta-Montrose Electric and other electrical cooperatives, was making “reliable energy a top issue.”

On Oct. 31, after Hurd announced his request, the Colorado Energy Office issued this biting response: “The Trump administration already illegally ripped away $600 million dollars for clean energy jobs-creating projects across the state. … It’s important to point out that wind and solar are cheaper for consumers than expensive and often unreliable coal-fired generation, and utility resource planning is subject to state — not federal — jurisdiction.”

That mirrored the statement from Polis provided to Big Pivots in mid-October:

“The Trump Administration wants to drag us backwards into an overreliance on a non-renewable resource creating a larger economic burden on the state and consumers. Orders like these would hurt Colorado ratepayers, and harm rural communities across the West who could be forced to absorb the unnecessary excess costs required to keep these unreliable plants operational.”

Looming in the background is the alliance of President Donald Trump with fossil fuel interests. In 2016, campaigning in Grand Junction, he vowed to bring coal back. He failed. Instead, prices of renewable energy plummeted and utilities readied plans to close coal plants.

In May 2024, according to the Washington Post, Trump told oil, gas and other fossil fuel executives that if they delivered $1 billion to his campaign, he’d help them out. All available evidence indicates he got less than asked but still substantial amounts, primarily from oil and gas.

Who decides what is needed?

The National Energy Dominance Council — one of the agencies visited by Highley on his trip to Washington — was created by Trump in February. In a story published in August, Politico said the new agency’s mission is to make the United States “energy dominant” by providing affordable, reliable energy to Americans while still generating enough electricity to power the boom in artificial intelligence.

Chris Wright, a Coloradan, is secretary of Energy and deputy director of the Energy Dominance Council. He was formerly the CEO of Liberty Energy, an oil and gas production services company based in Denver.

Highley said that Tri-State itself has excess generating capacity and does not need to continue operations of the coal-burning unit at Craig to ensure reliability. Supplies in the Western Interconnection Grid, of which Colorado is a part, have been tightening.

Sharing of electricity, however, remains hampered by lack of adequate transmission and organized markets. This is widely recognized in Colorado and beyond. The Western Governors Association held a conference in Denver just days before Hurd’s letter devoted to transmission.

Keeping the coal unit in Craig operating beyond its scheduled retirement will pose logistical challenges. The order under the 202(c) provision cannot be delivered until late this year, shortly before retirement. Further, the law allows orders for only 90 days, although they can be renewed.

Tri-State would have to procure the coal for the plant and have the workers in place to operate the plant. It has already announced plans to close the ColoWyo Mine, located about 20 miles south of Craig, late this year. However, Trapper Mine continues operations near the Craig plant as does Peabody’s Twenty Mile Mine between Hayden and Oak Creek.

Cost may be a greater issue. In January 2020, Highley announced Tri-State’s plans to get out of coal in Colorado. The reason, aside from state mandates, was cost. Coal has become the expensive fuel.

“How do we keep a coal plant operating for reliability of the overall Western Grid? Tri-State does not need it for our needs,” said Highley. “We have surplus capacity. But overall the Western grid does have some concerns about resource adequacy. So how do we keep a unit open that maybe isn’t in our financial interest but that the government says is in the national interest?”

“I’ve been asking, ‘Who’s going to pay for running this unit if we get an order that says it has to keep running,’” added Highley. “So far, no one has pulled out their checkbook. I hate for this burden to be placed on rural America. You know, our members, including farmers and ranchers, many are struggling to pay their bills today.”

Xcel Energy has been consistently restrained in its comments. It points to retirements approved by Colorado regulators: Comanche 2 in 2025, Hayden 2 in 2027, and Hayden 1 in 2028, followed by the retirement of Comanche 3 by the end of 2030. It is also replacing coal with gas at Pawnee.

In a brief interview on Oct. 29, Robert Kenney, the president of Xcel’s Denver-based division, Public Service Co. of Colorado, added a little more depth.

“We’ve been preparing to retire that plant (Comanche 2) by the end of the year since 2018, and so we’ll have to make sure that it is prepared to be able to run beyond the end of the year,” he said. “That’s going to obviously require some maintenance and some upkeep. If we get an order telling us to do that, we’ll have to examine the actual language of the order, understand what it requires of us. But we’ll comply with the law.”

Xcel also issued a statement on Oct. 31: “We are in regular conversations about Colorado’s energy future with various stakeholders, including federal, state and local elected officials. We are aware that there are members of the community that would like to see the plant’s life extended. ”

In ordering that fossil fuel plants remain open, the Trump administration assumes their value in providing baseload generation. In practice, no plants — coal, gas, and nuclear — operate without downtime for maintenance.

Unexpected outages can occur. Few coal plants have been as trouble-plagued as Xcel’s 750-megawatt Comanche 3. It was offline about 90 days each year during its first decade of operations, which began in 2010. Beginning in 2020, the unit was down for more than a year. Outages have been frequent since then.

In August, the unit went down again. This time, it’s not expected to resume operations until June 2026.

Comanche 2 — the unit scheduled for retirement in December — has had no comparable problems. It went online in 1975. Craig 1 has also had relatively few problems since operations began in 1980. They’re not 100%, but neither have they been lemons.

Plans laid in past decade

Retirements of both Comanche 2 and Craig 1 have been planned for years. In the case of Craig 1, Tri-State and its co-owners — Fort Collins-based Platte River Power Authority, Xcel Energy and also Salt River Project and PacifiCorp — were sued because of the contributions of the coal-burning units at Craig and Nucla to pollution that impaired air quality in the Mount Zirkel and other designated wilderness areas and national parks on the Western Slope. This deteriorated air quality violated the regional haze standards set by the EPA.

Tri-State and its co-owners could have installed equipment limiting emissions of nitrous oxide by 2021. Instead, they agree to close Craig 1 by 2025. Costs of wind, especially, but also solar were then plummeting, making continued operations of coal less attractive.

Comanche 2’s closing was planned in 2018. The order by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said Xcel would close the 335-megawatt unit “no later than the end of 2025.”

That PUC decision had been preceded by a response to Xcel’s request for bids that in December 2017 had caused slackened jaws — not just in Colorado, but across the nation. The PUC decision noted that Xcel’s solicitation had “garnered an exceptional number of diverse and low-cost bids.” This, the PUC commissioners said, “provides a rare opportunity to capture some of the lowest resource bids ever experienced in Colorado.”

Of note were the low cost of wind but also, for the first time in Colorado, utility-scale battery storage. The approved plan called for Xcel to purchase two existing gas plants.

Among the signatories to that PUC decision was then-Commissioner France Koncilja, now Pueblo County’s attorney in Comanche matters.

The PUC decision was issued in August 2018, several months before the election of Polis, who had run for governor on a platform of renewable energy. He had launched his campaign in Pueblo at the Solar Roast Coffee.

A month after the election of Polis, Xcel Energy summoned many to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science for a major announcement: It believed it could achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels) and 100% by 2050 in the eight states in which it operated.

Polis spoke, too. “Elections have consequences,” he said.

Xcel’s goals were enshrined in state legislation in May 2019.

The 2021 electric resource plan filed by Xcel Energy continued this planning. By October 2024, when Xcel filed its latest resource plan with the PUC, it noted an “inflection point” in its energy transition from coal.

From an average annual growth in demand of 0.7% during the previous five years, it was projecting a compounded annual demand growth of 4% from 2023 through 2031 in its base case. Even in a low-growth scenario, demand would grow 2.8% annually,

Meeting this demand, explained Xcel’s Jack Ihle, an Xcel vice president, would require Xcel’s generating capacity to expand from its existing 7 gigawatts to somewhere between 7.6 GW and 9.6GW by the end of 2031. Keep in mind Comanche 3’s capacity: three-quarters of one gigawatt.

The document mentioned “resource adequacy” more than a dozen times.

Resource adequacy

Worries about “resource adequacy” have mounted during the last two years. The Seattle Times reported on Oct. 21 of growth in electricity demand of 0.9% three years ago in the Pacific Northwest to now 3.2% per year. Energy + Environmental Economics, a consultant, found the most probable occurrence for a blackout would be a days-long cold snap during a year of relatively little hydropower production. That, however, was unlikely in the next five years.

Colorado has had no blackouts due to inadequate resources. Xcel, however, issued an orange alert on Aug. 7, warning its 1.5 million electrical customers in Colorado of a remote possibility for outages. A PUC staff member who analyzed the causes reported several problems, including less solar production than had been expected. That report also found that Xcel had 11 fossil fuel plants that had some amounts of unplanned outages. Of those, 80% were among coal plants.

Proponents of fossil fuel generation insist that coal plants will be needed for baseload generation. Undeniably it’s more reliable than solar power. Except, as in the case of Comanche 3, when it is missing in action for a year at a time. But all forms of generation — coal, natural gas and nuclear, too — have down time.

Do we have enough reserve margins in the grid? Trump in April directed the Department of Energy to analyze current and reserve margins of the nation’s three electrical grids. In issuing the report in July, the press release issued by the DOE said the analysis had revealed that retirement of fossil fuel plants and delays in adding new “firm capacity, driven by the radical green agenda of past administrations,” would lead to a surge in power outages and a growing discrepancy between electricity demand and supply. It cited growth in demand from data centers as a major cause of demand growth.

Green-leaning groups were skeptical. In a July appraisal, Ric OConnell, an analyst from GridLab, called the DOE report “problematic” because of questionable assumptions. Advanced Energy United, in August, said the DOE analysis was “rather a protocol for pursuing a preferred solution to addressing resource adequacy needs.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined eight other states in asking for a rehearing. Their motion mentioned retirement of both Craig and Pueblo this year.

“These retirements have been thoroughly vetted by state and regional authorities and approved only following an extensive examination of cost considerations and reliability impacts,” the motion said.

Xcel has been sounding an increasingly loud alarm about resource adequacy. A Feb. 11 letter from three senior officers at Xcel Energy’s Minneapolis headquarters warned that Colorado’s “resource planning process is proving too inflexible to meet needs in a dynamic environment.”

Xcel no longer met industry standard reliability metrics nor the reliability assumptions used in the planning process several years before, the letter warned. Even addition of a third gas-burning plant left Xcel in a “suboptimal position.”

Citing the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, Xcel reported that 76% of proposed resource additions from 2018 through 2022 had come online. In 2023, that figure fell to 53%. The rest were delayed or cancelled.

“The state of play is not only about load growth; generation retirements are outpacing new resources coming onto the grid. New resources are being delayed due to various factors and will aggravate the situation in the coming years. Demand is increasing, across the West.”

A different conclusion was drawn by the Colorado Energy Office in a report issued July 1.

Colorado utilities, the report said, have “adequate capacity to meet customer electricity needs.” That was an overall summary, though. Xcel’s component of that report mentioned that the utility expected to have a capacity shortfall of 88 megawatts in 2026, growing to 1,000 megawatts shortfall in 2030.

Two former PUC commissioners have also weighed in to support delayed retirements of coal plants. There are the comments and filings of Koncilja, a commissioner from 2016 to 2020, on behalf of the economic needs of Pueblo County. The county, with the notable exception of its steel plant, gets electricity from a utility other than Tri-State.

John Gavan, a commissioner from 2018 to 2022, has been more broadly raising concerns about resource adequacy. He cites the projected demands of data centers but also notes that some electric providers in Colorado are unregulated by the state in their resource planning, unlike Xcel and Tri-State.

The PUC regulates Xcel, Black Hills, and Tri-State but not municipal providers and other cooperatives, among them United Power, CORE Electrical Cooperative, and Holy Cross Energy.

Whatever concerns there were before, the Xcel’s report to the PUC in early October added urgency.

Environmental community

The environmental community in Colorado says the Trump administration has weak justification in using the 202(c) clause in the Federal Power Act. They point out that Colorado’s PUC has a rigorous process for ensuring that utilities have sufficient reserve margins. Xcel itself, in its October 2024 filing, noted Colorado’s “gold standard” for resource planning — although that was said while asserting the need to create a “new gold standard.

Groups also point out that peak demand in Colorado typically comes in summer, not winter, when the orders for the units at Craig and Pueblo may be issued.

“202(c) isn’t intended to be used for long-term resource planning,” said Matthew Gerhart, senior attorney for the Sierra Club at its Denver office. “It’s intended for use in war-time or similarly brief, sudden emergencies like natural disasters. Even if it were true that there are resource adequacy issues, 202(c) isn’t the proper vehicle for addressing those issues.”

For that matter, he said, electricity cannot be put on trucks like bananas or iPhones and shipped anywhere in the country. In electricity, Colorado remains much like an island, with limited transmission to other utilities in the West. Market mechanisms for electricity sharing are just now getting short, stubby legs — although that will change dramatically in the next five years.

“So, even if there were an electricity shortage in, say Washington or Idaho or California, that doesn’t mean that keeping Craig 1 online will help, given the lack of a West-wide electricity market and the transmission limitations and congestions,” Gerhart said.

Sarah Keane, an attorney with Kaplan Kirsch who represents Colorado Communities for Climate Action and others, pointed out that the need is more than bulk power. Technologies that have flexible ramping, including natural gas, can better respond to peak demands than can coal.

Erin Overturf, clean energy director for Western Resource Advocates, said if the grid faces an actual emergency, the Trump administration would be using every tool it had. Instead, it has been doing everything it can to stop renewable energy development. She calls it a “manufactured emergency.”

And, in the case of Craig 1, there is that sticky matter of complying with the federal laws limiting regional haze.

In Arizona, cost was the fulcrum for this issue, not environmental needs.

The Arizona Corporation Commission, that state’s equivalent of the Colorado PUC, pushed back at calls by Republican state legislators to the federal government to bring mothballed coal plants in Arizona out of retirement.

Kevin Thompson, the chair of the commission, said in a May 30 posting that bringing the recently closed Cholla plant in northern Arizona into compliance with federal environmental standards would cost a “staggering $1.9 billion — a cost to be borne by ratepayers of its owner, Arizona Public Service.”

In Arizona, the commission members are elected, not appointed by the governor, as is the case in Colorado. Thompson campaigned with the boast that he had “stopped the Green New Deal.”

“Managing highly intricate systems like our electrical grid is far more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker,” Thompson said.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/xcel-coal-Comanche_01.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 07:18:59.873730

You can find me there and at Twitter, Doug Lewin Energy, as well as YouTube, Doug Lewin Energy.","This is Part 1 of my conversation with Nat. Part 2 will be out next Wednesday.

Texas has plenty of energy stories. The harder part is finding the signal through the noise of endless filings. That is why Nat Bullard’s new venture, Halcyon, matters. It turns piles of ERCOT and PUC dockets into something manageable. It’s AI that makes dense regulatory filings sortable and understandable.

Meanwhile, Nat’s annual presentation has become must-read material for anyone trying to understand what’s happening in the world of energy: the market forces, capital shifts, and technologies driving global change. He looks at macro trends like EV adoption, clean-tech capital flows, global cost curves.

We talked about one of the main takeaways from this year’s edition: China’s dominance in EV manufacturing and exports

We also talked a lot about a recent study Halcyon did with GridLab to quantify the rapidly escalating costs of gas turbines. I asked what his biggest takeaway from compiling that research:

“The biggest one for me being at a $2,500 a kilowatt cost for a combined cycle gas plant. What other competing options are there for providing power?”

At that cost, there are many better options, including re-using older turbines as many of the data center developers are doing. Storage that can be sited quickly. Demand flexibility can meet much of the need. Solar is still going onto the grid at about a gigawatt per month. Targeted wires upgrades and fast local capacity can bridge the gap while long-lead assets work their way through the process.

I left this conversation thinking about how information itself is infrastructure. If we can see what’s changing — if the opaque can become more transparent — we can make better, more informed decisions.

Doug Lewin (00:05.42)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin. My guest this week is Nat Bullard. Nat is and has been for a long time one of the smartest guys on energy issues. I know I have been reading his stuff long before I knew him. He does a now famous slideshow, highly anticipated by folks in the energy space that comes out every January. The last one, as many of the ones before, 200 slides long. We talked a little bit about his process for pulling all that together. He was at New Energy Finance before it was acquired by Bloomberg, wrote a newsletter that was read by hundreds of thousands of folks. He is more currently the co-founder of Halcyon, an AI-assisted research and information platform focused on energy transition. I have started using it a lot. It is great for those of us that are tracking regulatory dockets, sometimes with their many hundreds or even thousands of filings within a single docket. It is a great way to quickly summarize some of those documents. Highly recommend folks check that out. We will have a link to that as well as his famous slideshow presentation in the show notes.

This conversation did go long. I love talking to Nat. And so we split this one into two. In this first one, you’ll hear a whole lot of discussion of China. He’s based in Singapore, including a whole lot on EVs and the future of the automotive industry, a whole lot more. I think you’re really going to enjoy this and then come back next week to listen to the other one. Also, please don’t forget to give us a five-star review wherever you listen to the podcast and also to subscribe to the Texas Energy and Power newsletter and to the Energy Capital podcast. This is a free episode. It is not free to produce. Becoming a paid member at Substack really helps support our activity. So please do that today if you haven’t already. And with nothing further, please enjoy the Energy Capital podcast with Nat.

Nat Bullard (02:05.634)

Doug Lewin, thank you for having me. What a treat. I was just listening to you on the treadmill yesterday, and here we are in the flesh, so to speak.

Doug Lewin (02:14.868)

It is, I can’t tell you Nat how gratifying it was to get an email from you. I can’t remember when you sent it a couple months ago, six months ago or something saying, really enjoying the newsletter. I said to my wife, I’m like, I got a note from Nat Bullard today. Of course she’s not in the energy world. So she’s like, who? And I told her, you’re a big deal. She needs to know who you are. Nat, for anybody in the audience that doesn’t know, Nat does this, I think everybody probably will, but this amazing annual presentation. I’m sometimes asked by people, Hey, you seem to know a thing or two. Like what are some of the sources you learn from? And you’re one I always name, especially for folks that kind of want to get a global perspective. So we’re going to talk about that. What you’re doing with the presentation, some of the major takeaways, what you’re looking at for next year. But first you’ve got this new venture, which sounds super exciting to me as somebody who spends a lot of time reading regulatory filings and trying to dig through regulatory filings, ERCOT, NPRRs and all that kind of stuff. Let everybody know what you’re up to with Halcyon before we jump into the rest.

Nat Bullard (03:19.662)

With pleasure, Doug. So I spent a long time in the energy and the decarbonization research business. I was 15 years at the startup and then a company that got acquired by Bloomberg, New Energy Finance that became Bloomberg New Energy Finance became BNEF. And when I finished and took some time out on my own, I realized that I still have a real yen for the information business and the information in and around energy and changes in the system. And I also realized that it was a moment where technology allows us to do things that are different. And there are teams of people that are willing to deploy it and interested in building something new around it that viewed all of the stuff that you just described, you know, ERCOT, NPRR, or thousands of large generator interconnection agreements as a feature input for large language model and AI-driven capabilities, as opposed to a bug of people having to just read stuff by hand, so to speak, over and over and over again. And so about two years ago now, my lead investor, Andrew Beebe at Obvious Ventures, connected me with my co-founders, Bruce Falk and Alex Shuris, who are both veterans of building and operating companies and information systems at real scale, like really, really big. Billion dollar company revenue lines. Who only knows how big an information system in terms of that size, but real platforms. And we said to each other, like, what can we do with today’s new technology to answer questions and solve information challenges that we know exist?

And what we settled on is that actually it’s all of that stuff. It’s everything that exists in an unstructured, as the saying would go, fashion that is all text, that is all public, at least at the initial phases, but is, as we joke about internally, a denial of service attack on getting your work done. You want to read everything in ERCOT? It’s public. Go for it. Here you go. Here’s a fire hose of tens of thousands of pages a week per institution. And there’s 50 of them plus one if you include the District of Columbia. Start including all the other things you need to include. The federal layers, the other state layers. We’re talking about on the order of probably hundreds of thousands of pages a week of information. And within those hills, there’s gold. It’s just that it’s not often conveyed in a way that is readable by machine in our old classical way of thinking about it. But with today’s technology, with AI in particular, you know, we move from computers that can compute, that can add and subtract and multiply to machines that can read and can allow us to start extracting information that we really need. If you want to find the price of something, if you want to find a change to a forecast, if you want to find how did this number turn into that number. It often exists. It’s just that you would find it in say the third response to a request for information in this part of a proceeding in that state without any change log.

Doug Lewin (06:22.048)

Nat, I am so into that right now. So Oncor is in the middle of its rate case and there’s exactly that going on. Environmental Defense Fund and Google and a coalition of cities in their third and fourth requests for information. And within those long questions and long replies, there’s so much good information, but man, it is hard to like download every document and scan through there for what’s actually important. This is one of those use cases for AI. When people say, what are you actually going to use it for? This is one of the first things I say is like, my goodness. It makes what is just a, like you said, denial of service attack. Perfect. Like it’s just an impossible thing to do. This makes it possible.

Nat Bullard (07:06.286)

It does make it possible with a couple of other wrinkles on it. One is that it’s all in one place. So what tends to happen is you have people that specialize for good reason in a market, a jurisdiction, a service territory, an interconnection, whatever it is. And they tend to know all of that. But their ability to compare across jurisdiction, service territories, whatever it might be, is essentially nil. They don’t have the literal or figurative information architecture to do that. That’s something we built. You want to go search Texas, you can do it just the way you search Oklahoma, you can do it just the way you search Arkansas. It’s all in one place. It’s all there. You can draw comparisons across these jurisdictions. You can also, and this is something we began building in the last three or four months, abstract it up a layer, if you will, into something that has structure. So our way of thinking about it is when we have search and query capability, which we do, that people are welcome to try out, when you begin to have repeated queries from different parties about the same thing, that’s an indication that you should begin systematizing and programmatizing this into something that has a subscription basis. So that’s why the first thing that we built was, just go in and tell me what’s actually happening at the verified, costed, priced, disclosed level in the universe of building gas plants in the US.

You know, when everybody’s there trying to basically debug what somebody said on stage at CERAWeek, we can get to the number. I realized we have sources for that, right? We have places that we can go and find that. And every month we run that as a set of routines. We run that as a data science project that then manifests into an actual output that has all the numbers in it. And it’s got more than the numbers, it’s got the text updates on like this date has been pushed back a little bit or so and so is making an objection or whatnot. And it’s all put into a fashion that matches the other use case, which is not discovery, not I’m curious about what’s going on, or I want to find what I need to know more about, but rather I know exactly what I’m looking for, just give it to me. So we’re sort of attacking information in these two planes. One is sort of open with free structure for people to come in and search. The other is defined and deliberate and delivered for them on a cadence. Where the AI and LLM element comes in on that is just speed. Like this is the kind of stuff that back in the day you might’ve been able to do quarterly because you’re trying to go find out what’s new, trying to find out what’s update, trying to in your head, maintain a change log of it. Now we do it monthly at the moment in the future. The goal will be that this is essentially a continuum, right? That this lives and breathes essentially in terms of what’s been updated and what’s been changing, what’s happening right now.

Doug Lewin (09:49.518)

Yeah. And you mentioned the tracker for gas plants. We’re going to talk about that as we get into there. But what I first wanted to talk to you about was the slide deck that you did, which if folks haven’t looked at it, of course, there’s the annual one in January. If you haven’t looked at that, definitely go look at that. Just a wealth of knowledge there. And you did, I don’t know if it’s a mid-year update or just like a separate thing. It’s kind of, I think a separate thing. Was it discontinuity, disparity, data, if I’ve got that right?

Nat Bullard (10:15.512)

You got it.

Doug Lewin (10:18.988)

You did it at New York Climate Week and you had a slide in there as you do in your annual slide deck. You had several about Texas. You had a couple in this one about Texas too. And it was something that is the topic of a whole lot of conversations in Texas, which is the wide disparity between what ERCOT is projecting for load growth and what the transmission system providers, the utilities are putting out there. So first of all, talk about that slide and what you found in your research. And again, how hopefully it’s going to become much easier to kind of track these things going forward.

Nat Bullard (10:51.832)

This is one of my favorites, and it’s one of those things that’s sort of hiding in plain sight, if you will. To its credit, ERCOT has great information availability. Mapping that information can sometimes be a little bit tough, but it’s pretty good about updating stuff frequently and publicly. One of the recent things that ERCOT did was show how the transmission service providers in Texas, and then the grid operator itself, is thinking about future load, what’s going to be added to the system. And what I love about this is that the sort of the general shape of these charts is roughly the same until you get to the data center element of it. And ERCOT itself says we expect about 22 gigawatts of new load by 2030 from data centers, which in and of itself is a very, very big number. Let’s be clear. The TSPs on the other hand say we expect 78 gigawatts. Now, one of these things is not like the other one. A nearly 4X larger forecast for data centers and transmission service providers is noteworthy. It also seems to be perhaps a bit of a stretch. What is the current summer peak right now in ERCOT? 85, 87?

Doug Lewin (12:00.174)

85.5.

Nat Bullard (12:03.446)

Okay, I was close enough. This assumption would say we’re going to reach 90% of the current summer peak load just from data centers by 2030. Now, when we put it like that, that seems to be aggressive, but it’s a good lesson in how the TSPs, transmission service providers versus the grid operator, think about this. Because as your previous guest, Travis Kavulla, pointed out, there are incentives in place for those who build infrastructure to want to build more to accommodate more growth. Indeed. Yes. There are equally incentives on the part of ERCOT to keep things, as they used to say, to least cost and best fit, to best adequately reflect the reality, but also to do so at the lowest cost and with the highest reliability. And what I enjoy about this is that these are both official in their way. It’s not that like one of these is like the shadow version of it. And it’s not that like one of these is like a rebuttal. These are both essentially official ways of looking at the same information and making the same, drawing the same assumptions, but also with different purposes in mind. And yes, to your point, there is all to play for in essentially taking this one and making it look like that one. In the long run, they do have to collapse into one frame that would be reality.

And the question is, which one of these things is going to have to do either the expansion or the contraction? It is possible that ERCOT’s forecast is too low. I would wager that the transmission service provider’s forecast is probably too high. But that’s because they’re given the incentive to assume that much growth and to try to build according for it. And what we need to do in the future is to do a lot of things. One, we need to follow these things just as the data evolve. And again, ERCOT’s very good about doing that. Watch what actually has been approved for energization, change over time. Watch what’s going into the study. Watch what’s going through approval processes. The other, and this is a bigger informational challenge that I look forward to digging into in the future, is what I would call deduping. A lot of the things that are in the TSP assumption are probably assets that are being either planned in multiple parts of the state, or say the same finite amount of compute is being planned in multiple places, or it’s being planned across jurisdictions, which is an even more complex thing to try to de-duplicate. It’s a development business after all. And I think your audience of all will know exactly what I mean, is that this is what developers do. It’s a feature of good development to go out and keep multiple places live at one moment on the assumption that not all of them will come through.

Doug Lewin (14:41.73)

Yeah. You know, it’s interesting, and this is one that will be a place to look for more information and folks can go and try out Halcyon to see what it brings up for you. But there’s 58480, I believe is the PUC control number. I’m doing this by memory. You can go look at the show notes and I’ll have the correct one in there. But I believe it’s 58480 is the load forecasting docket that is open at the PUC right now. The legislature passed Senate Bill 6 to kind of deal with this because during the session, they were getting testimony from ERCOT. And some of ERCOT’s own, right, they have this kind of range of projections anywhere from 22 up to, you know, I think they have one projection that puts it like at 138 by 2031 or something. So there’s even within ERCOT’s own projections, there’s sort of this range. And then they were getting information from the transmission system providers. It was going to be much higher to your point.

So they said, Hey, we need to actually like figure this out. We need to know how much of this is real. So there’s a load forecasting docket. There’s another one, which is I believe 58481, which is actually a financial assurance. They’re going to make the project developers and data centers actually put some money down to actually have an official study and then show some kind of documentation is still going to be worked out through rules that it’s actually a real project, some kind of spend somewhere along the way. And they have to report to your point Nat, if they are investigating multiple sites. So I think what we’re going to start to see is that queue start to come down to more like realistic levels, still rapid growth, right? But probably not doubling in the space of three to five years.

Nat Bullard (16:26.518)

And what you describe is the regulatory institutions doing their essential work. And I mean this like I’m delighted to see this happening. This is something that actually is not within the gift of companies themselves to do. Markets respond to incentives and the incentive here is created by the regulatory body to say, go ahead and do this. And it’s interesting. If you think about this as a leading indicator of where other markets and jurisdictions might go is the forced disclosure of duplication is fascinating. And that’s probably something that I can only imagine happening first in Texas because of its size and breadth. That could happen in some other big states. It probably scales according to the physical size of the state and the size of the electricity system, which means guess what’s going to be first?

It’s going to be Texas. But a great effort that, again, I would hope to see picked up by other regulators elsewhere over time. And in the process, something that we just need to drive through information channels as much as possible to do and bless you for going directly to the docket number for people who are looking it up. This is one thing I’ve had fun explaining. I’ve had fun explaining to some of my colleagues. I was like, when you reach final boss level of people who do this for a living, they’re going to go to a prompt and just punch in a number. They’re going to go to a state and a number. And that’s how they’re going to think. And that’ll be amazing when we get to that point. We have people working on both planes. One come in and tell me something about X. Another is an incredibly detailed and nested question pointed directly at a docket. I will give you a for instance here, while catching up on our Discord chat with the engineers, they’re like, somebody is firing in some crazy informed queries right now. I was like, that would be Doug. I looked at the querying log, and I was like, that would be Doug. So more of that, please. Okay, many such examples, please, from all of you out there listening.

Doug Lewin (18:22.766)

Definitely. No, I love that you guys have created this tool. I’m looking forward to using it. Cause yeah, like we’re just talking about it takes a lot of time for these things. Okay. So switching gears just slightly. Again, I am just a huge fan of your annual presentation. I obviously spent a lot of time with it in January when it came out. I’ve referred back to it several times since, but I actually took a good chunk of the day, went through it all again. It was just sort of, again, just blown away by the breadth and depth, but really the breadth of this 200 slide presentation that you put together every year.

Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess this is kind of a two-parter, my audience will be used to this, I usually ask like five part questions, Nat. But a couple different things here, one kind of your process for putting it together, because I think it’s again, just kind of, you’re obviously not putting it together the week before it comes out, you must be gathering this stuff all the time and like kind of fascinated with your process. Interested if there’s anything that stands out in your head as like, just sort of a major takeaway because I would imagine, because you have so much in there about what’s going on around the world, some of which is just really stunning, this stuff about Vietnam and just things that are happening around the world that we aren’t necessarily hearing about in American news media or European or wherever listeners might be. And then of course, I asked the question I think any Nat Bullard fan would want to ask, what’s coming in the next one? What can we look for? It’s only a couple of months away from the next iteration. So can you give us a sneak preview?

Nat Bullard (19:57.55)

Sure. Thank you for that nested two-part question. I’m going to take the first part first. The way that I do this process is probably not going to be the most satisfying answer for people. I keep a giant running file of screen caps, snips, tables, links, anything that I have seen come across as catching the eye, a point of takeoff, a point of inflection, something where there has been a big headline or a change and I deliberately apply no taxonomy to it at first. So when I sort of hit wrap on my intake process last year, I had 385 slides that I took down to 200. And in the process, I probably took it down to about 170 and then built it back up with things that I know I needed to fill in. So I’m just going out there and I’m doing this live. It’s one of my favorite things to do, but it’s also like a subroutine. It’s not in real time, particularly active. Sometimes I’ll sit down on like a Saturday or a Sunday morning and I will start assembling things into sort of a more full frame. A lot of them I’m just flagging to go check on later. So, you know, where there’s higher frequency data, if it’s interesting in April, I should probably go check and make sure that it’s still valid in November. And so I put it all together into one place and then starting right about now, I start to kind of layer the themes on top of it. And so that’s sort of 80% observational. These are the things that I’m seeing. And then it’s about 20% aspirational in terms of what do I want to have come in and fill in the rest of this? And it’s funny. It’s probably because they’re the last slides in the deck.

Nobody actually looks at them. But the things that I enjoy most are my slides that are data driven, but sort of asking a question or a look ahead for us at the very end. When I do a retro on this, those are the ones that I tend to be the happiest about because I’ve raised the question further up the ladder. They don’t tend to be the ones that people come in and ask me about in the process. But I’m in the flow of just assembling sort of with no fear and with no favor the things that I find interesting from a pretty broad brush. So I get a lot of things from socials. I get a lot of things sent my way, by referral. I routinely check certain sources to see what’s interesting. And I try to learn as much from smart conversations with other people that might direct me to go out and find something. That’s the aspirational part. You should go look at this. You should take a closer look at that. And I’m always looking for novelty in the truest sense of the word. Is this new? Is this something that might not be well known? And that, I think, is where people one way or another entrust me with information. That’s the part where I hope to have the most value is, let me bring you something that you didn’t know. You know, there are things that are well priced. You know trends, you know, we know the cost of the solar module. That’s well priced. Less well priced, trade flows of Chinese solar modules into Africa. So that’s an example of where we can move from well priced to less well priced, so to speak, informationally. Or thinking too, in terms of adjacency, what are markets or technologies or business models that potentially become more relevant over time? So that’s the part one. Now part two, if I recall correctly, is like, what am I looking ahead to? What am I thinking about? Is that right?

Doug Lewin (23:25.09)

Yeah, I’m also just wondering some of those that kind of stand out that like people, particularly even like astute American power observers might, you know, look at your slide deck and be like, Whoa, man, if there’s nothing that pops to mind, we could also just talk about what’s coming next.

Nat Bullard (23:40.782)

There is so much. One is the Chinese auto complex, which is how I refer to it in the last deck. Yeah. There are only 11 countries in the world that have a full stack of doing an auto business, basically every capability from soup to nuts. China is now first among them. China makes something like 40% of the world’s vehicles.

Doug Lewin (24:00.726)

And that is, I know this from your slide, I think like 20 years ago, it was like three or four percent.

Nat Bullard (24:05.494)

Yeah, it was at the beginning of the century. It was less than 5%. I want to say it is the world’s biggest maker of all vehicles. It’s the world’s biggest maker of cars. It’s the world’s biggest exporter of cars. It’s the world’s biggest maker of EVs. It’s the world’s biggest exporter of EVs. This trend is not reversing anytime soon. And it is resonating outward to pretty much every other large auto market in the world, with the exception of the United States. And I would also say Japan. And this is something that I bring up because there are many, many things folded into this. It is trade flow. It is trade balances. It is national competitiveness. It is national champion industries. Automobility has been a classic way to move a country’s industrial capability upwards and with it, cohorts of an economy into the middle class. What happens if that’s no longer going to be the case? Or is China going to be the way Japan was of manufacturing in Kentucky, in North Carolina? You know, are we going to find that kind of path that’s driven by a combination of policy and incentives, but also market access?

Or is China just going to dominate? I’ll give you an anecdote. I live here in Southeast Asia. I was recently on a family trip in Thailand. The drive from Suvarnabhumi Airport into downtown Bangkok is quite long. And the rest of my family was sound asleep. I was not, because I was just counting billboards. I want to count all the car billboards between the airport and downtown. And I did not see a single billboard on this nearly hour long drive that was for a non-Chinese company. And of those, only a couple that were not for an EV. And one of them that was not for an EV was for a, like essentially an extended range hybrid, so small internal combustion, very big battery car. Kind of like the inverse of the plug-in hybrids that we have in the US. This is one thing that I think is really important because a lot gets wrapped into this. And it is for many reasons kind of outside the frame of what we think about in the United States. We have a huge auto business. We sell a lot of autos to ourselves. We do export, but not nearly to the scale that like Japan or Germany does relative to output. And we’ve optimized our full stack of automobility for America essentially, and for other countries that want to buy cars in the fashion that we do. China does everything else. And that’s something that I think is largely invisible, but I will put a question to you and to your listeners. Like when’s the first time you’re going to see an extended range Chinese electric pickup on somebody’s ranch in Texas? You know, when is the street going to find a way that one of those things is going to show up to someone’s like, I’ve got 400 miles of battery range and I can run 220V power in the bed.

Doug Lewin (26:53.742)

I think we’re a long, long way away from that. To me, Nat, the more interesting, that’s an interesting question, but one I wouldn’t even hazard a guess for. I think the more interesting question is when will we see some sort of Chinese manufacturing? And that’s probably a long, long way away. I sort of lost the thread. There was that CATL factory that was going to be co-located with, was it Ford or GM in Michigan? And then that got squashed, I think.

Nat Bullard (27:22.822)

I’ll give, that was the case. I’m not that positive. Yeah.

Doug Lewin (27:25.368)

That may be if America wants to export to the world, you’re almost at this point, gonna have to do it with China? Like this kind of stuff to the point of why I think your presentation is so good, because it does lead you to thoughts that otherwise you’re not really thinking about, right? You’re just like you said, like we have this American manufacturing industry, it’s mostly here, it’s sort of like internal. So we just sort of stay protectionist and we just sell to ourselves. That’s probably what happens, honestly, for the next 10, 15 years. Probably the most likely outcome.

Nat Bullard (27:58.222)

It is. It leads me to ask a couple of things, which is like how well optimized will our vehicles be for different future paths, right? For exporting to somewhere else where people want smaller, longer range EVs, for instance. How much are we exposed to the technological frontier? You know, it was Jim Farley at Ford who had imported one of these vehicles, Xiaomi’s vehicles, sorry, in order to test and he was like, this is a great car. You know, it is.

Doug Lewin (28:23.082)

And it was probably like $20,000, had like entertainment screens all over it. I mean, I don’t think we’re probably gonna be able to compete with that. And that is the thing that like that whole incident, just terrible, right? The Georgia plant, the Hyundai plant with, you know, Korean workers being put in chains and stuff like that was a path for the United States and maybe still is if there’s some amazing diplomatic work done somewhere, but like Korean technology and like an American and South Korean obviously partnership could have maybe put us in a way to compete, but now that’s looking less likely too.

Nat Bullard (29:03.092)

It’s important that you mention that because this is an industry in which it’s more than just setting up a distributorship. This isn’t paint or televisions even. This is an industry wherein you need to have a great deal of integration almost at a country level and certainly at a country immigration policy level in order to do this kind of work. And is the willingness going to be there? This is something that the US encountered in the 1980s with Japan, with Japanese companies setting up. And it took time and it took a sense of durability for it to happen as well. Yes. I think you raised the right question, but like what other parts of that supply chain could you have companies setting up and doing before it’s a full vertically integrated factory stack? And then the other question is even when that’s done, at what point is it going to really be worth the tariff to just import something? Because it’s at a price point, the quality is there, the market is there.

You know, I give Singapore as a fascinating auto market because it is tiny. Astonishingly expensive to get a car, well disclosed and visible and with data updated every month. And in December, 2021 BYD had 0.1% market share here in Singapore. It is now the biggest single brand retailer of cars in Singapore. So in less than four years, bigger than Toyota. And that tells you something. My building is full of them and increasingly other Chinese brands are showing up as well. But it’s interesting to watch a market that, look, does not have an embedded auto industry. It only has importers and distributors. Wherein with that kind of uncovered level of competition, you see the interest in stuff like this happening. And you see it differentially elsewhere in, you know, in Sub-Saharan Africa, in parts of the Middle East, certainly in Southeast Asia, even in Australia, you know, the interest from these companies coming in with a competitive product at a competitive price and seeing where that meets the market.

Doug Lewin (30:57.582)

I want to jump back to power stuff, but before we do that, this is just a really interesting thread to pull on. We’ve been talking about electric vehicles for seven, eight, nine minutes, whatever. We haven’t mentioned Tesla. We’ve been talking about American manufacturers, right? Like Tesla obviously is still one of the largest manufacturers in the world, but you do have some slides about they seem to be kind of peaking in the last year or two. Now there’s a lot that is bound up obviously in politics and the, you know, controversies that Elon has gotten himself into. You know, Tesla is still this huge question mark because the, I think the cars are still great. They’re moving towards autonomous vehicles. He’s making all these MegaPacks. There’s all these connections to the grid. You know, it’s the Energy Capital podcast. I focus on Texas, a Texas headquartered company doing some lithium mining and processing in Texas. So hard to have that discussion, I think, without at least bringing up Tesla, but I don’t know, it raises a lot more questions. It makes me scratch my head because I don’t know, I don’t know what the trajectory of that company is.

Nat Bullard (31:54.828)

You know what? There’s many, many of these questions and I actually look back to only one, which is how new is the lineup? You know, we have new trims for some of the existing models, but we don’t have a brand new mass market model in quite some time. Yeah. The Cybertruck is brand new. It’s not mass market. No, the Model 3 and Y are relatively venerable at this point. They do have updates and because they are software driven, they have a way of, you know, sort of improving themselves over time, but it’s different than the cycle time of some of the other manufacturers in the US and certainly the manufacturers elsewhere in terms of how frequently they’re updating brand new models, not just trims, but like totally new models, new chassis, new everything. And that’s my only real question is like, how do we think about it from a brand perspective? This is the trickiest thing to do. You know, every other car company, you have to talk about it like a brand. Tesla has sort of always been more of like an identity and with all these other things wrapped into it. I try to keep it very spare and just think about it from a car perspective. You know, as a car company, which is still what it is primarily, how are those cars being received in the market? And with only updated trims of late, and especially with the sunsetting of the EV credit, how is this going to play in a market that is increasingly supplied with lots of other options?

Doug Lewin (33:08.332)

Yeah. And of course, they’re looking more and more to the power sector. MegaPack is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the company, which may be a good segue to get back into the power sector. I do think I love that whole discussion because to a certain extent to our detriment, we think of these things as being really distinct. Like here’s the auto industry and here’s the power industry. But these days, as transportation becomes electrified, those lines are quite blurred and we’re kind of talking about the same thing when we talk about this stuff. So it’s getting interesting, right?

Nat Bullard (33:38.336)

It is. I’ll give you one last thought on that and then we can move it forward, which is that I’m going to ask you a question. So I did this annual presentation. What percent of my viewers of it are in the US? Do you think?

Doug Lewin (33:50.35)

I would guess 50%.

Nat Bullard (33:54.094)

43% last year. There’s a big world out there. There are lots of people from the US who want to look outside. From the outside, look into the US. And there’s a lot of people that want to look essentially mathematically in chords on a circle compared to the way that you and I are having a conversation right now. They’re in Brazil, and they’re very interested in thinking about what’s happening in Australia or vice versa.

Doug Lewin (34:16.075)

Yeah. No, I think a lot of times, obviously Americans, I do this myself. Shit, as a Texan, I do this a lot. Just think like this is where things are happening. It’s one of the things I love about your presentation. There is a great big world out there. And I do try to write about that at the newsletter too, right? Especially China and what has happened there. All right. So let’s get into some of the stuff that was in this latest slide deck, Discontinuity, Disparity, Data. And I believe you did the report right with GridLab about the prices of natural gas. So one of the things you had in there is this great slide that kind of shows the prices combined cycle gas turbines, basically averaging over $2,000 per kilowatt. Then you’ve got combustion turbines, much less somewhere in the $1,200 to $1,400. Now, one of the things we’re seeing that, and I’m wondering how much you’re tracking this or even can track this. I’m hearing more and more about this just from talking to people, but even the podcast Odd Lots last week got into this a little bit. Their guest put a drone over the Stargate facility.

Nat Bullard (35:09.746)

Stargate, yeah.

Doug Lewin (35:13.55)

They had seen the types of gas turbines that were there, and they’re pretty much like used, I don’t know what vintage or era, but they were like smaller, I assume, aeroderivatives, like Caterpillar turbines or something like that. I’ll add one more bit of data before I ask the question. Mitsubishi announced they’re gonna double their capacity of gas turbines. Do you see the gas turbine constraint kind of lifting anytime soon or do you think we’re really looking at like all the way through like 2035 these very elevated prices for new gas or used gas as it were?

Nat Bullard (35:52.34)

So I’ll start at the back. Do we see this easing? No, the demand is way in excess of supply and even Mitsubishi’s commitment. You don’t snap your fingers and magic up like rotor casting. Okay. Like, you know, these are some of the most complicated things in the world to possibly make with lots of lead time and in an industry that is rightly, I think, judicious about its expansion plans, having done this in years past, in eras past.

Doug Lewin (36:24.43)

20 years ago, right? And having a big old bubble burst.

Nat Bullard (36:27.788)

Wildly oversupplying a market for quite a long time. So that’s to my old saw here about, you know, markets responding to incentives. The incentives are complex and companies will react accordingly. The type of turbines that are being moved are fascinating. Yeah, like things that are aeroderivatives that have traditionally in these companies been sold by the oil and gas group. They were used offshore. They were used for field production. They might’ve been put behind the fence for LNG or something like that. Now being used as primary power production. There’s a move to buy used plant and move it around. I mean, that’s, you know, sure. Why not? That’s going to be of finite catchment in the long run, I think. And as far as price point goes, it’s funny because I put this slide up and the first comment I got was somebody’s like, I’m building those things and my prices are like three times higher. I’m like, show me your prices. And he’s like, I’m not doing that. I’m like, all right then.

Doug Lewin (37:24.654)

I’m not putting you in my slideshow.

Nat Bullard (37:26.222)

Yeah. Well, but also part of the purpose of building it this way, the reason that we wanted to work with GridLab on that white paper and the reason that our clients at Halcyon want this information is the rigor with which it’s sourced, which is I know that y’all are paying higher prices, but what I have here are the things that are in the regulatory disclosure. They have what’s called a CPCN or certificate of public convenience and necessity or the equivalent. Therefore, they kick into a process where we have visibility on cost, volume, time, conditions, all that sort of stuff. And that’s what we’re recording here. And also the full data set serves a broader purpose. A lot of people use it for physical trading. So they’re trying to say like with this asset coming online here and with my assumptions on asset utilization, what does that mean for demand at this node? You know, what does that mean for demand on this strip, that kind of stuff? So yeah, the numbers that we have here are lower than what people are probably getting quoted. In fact, I know they’re lower than what people are getting quoted.

But they are the revealed cost. Again, back around to my earlier comment, this is why we run this thing pretty much continuously to continue to get more sunlight. And in the long run, having come from a background where we did this quite usefully, would be to do a survey capability of it. I’d love to be able to do bids and asks here and get a sense in the long run of where people are at. We’re not quite there. It takes, having built this sort of thing before, it takes a little bit of time before you can get there. But if you’re out there listening and you’d be willing to start sharing bids and asks with me in terms of like when you’re getting quoted for combustion turbines, I’d be happy to talk. I want things that are only official. I don’t want anecdotes and I don’t want anything that’s non-verified. So that’s the purpose of doing this. But yeah, the numbers are striking to say the least. And there’s just, there’s a lot of future uncertainty about it. I mean, the biggest one for me being at a $2,500 a kilowatt cost for a combined cycle gas plant. What other competing options are there for providing power?

While many of these measures aim to strengthen Canada’s long-term competitiveness, they also create new opportunities for investors and small businesses to improve cash flow and lower taxable income.

From accelerated write-offs for equipment purchases to expanded credits for clean-tech manufacturing and R&D (research and development), the updated framework rewards companies that reinvest in growth and modernization.

Here’s how investors and entrepreneurs can apply these tax tools to strengthen their financial position and position for future gains.

#1. Invest in growth now — and write it off immediately

The new Productivity Super-Deduction announced in the Budget 2025 gives businesses a powerful reason to invest before 2030.

Under this rule, companies can immediately expense the full cost of eligible assets — including machinery, manufacturing equipment, and clean-energy systems — instead of depreciating them over several years.

For small business owners, optimal tactics include:

Time major capital purchases before the program phases out.

Combine the deduction with provincial grants or green financing for maximum leverage.

Consider upgrading production lines or fleet vehicles to clean-energy models — both qualify.

Investor insight

Companies that reinvest early will report stronger after-tax profits and higher operating efficiency, especially in manufacturing, logistics, and construction sectors. So, watch for firms announcing capital reinvestment plans — it’s a bullish signal that they’re taking advantage of this incentive.

Why it matters: Immediate expensing lowers taxable income in the year of purchase, freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested in operations, staff, or technology upgrades.

#2. Ride the wave of clean economy investment credits

Budget 2025 cements Canada’s Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits, offering 15% to 60% credits on spending in clean tech, hydrogen, carbon capture, and manufacturing of renewable components.

Good tactics for businesses include:

Partner with clean-tech suppliers or retrofit your facilities using qualifying technologies (solar, geothermal, energy storage).

Stack credits by pairing clean-tech equipment investments with the Productivity Super-Deduction.

Investor insight

Green infrastructure firms, utilities, and clean manufacturing companies stand to benefit. Look for publicly traded companies scaling their decarbonization strategies — their future returns may be partially government-funded.

Why it matters: These credits drastically reduce the effective cost of clean-energy investments — making Canada more competitive with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

#3. Tap into critical mineral and manufacturing credits

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) now covers 12 new minerals, expanding opportunities for exploration and extraction. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Credit further boosts producers involved in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, solar panels, and semiconductor components.

For business owners cosider whether or not your company supports this sector (e.g., logistics, engineering, component supply) — and partner early. Government incentives often ripple through the entire value chain.

Insight for small-cap investors

Junior miners exploring nickel, lithium, graphite, or rare earths are poised to benefit.

Look for exploration companies with eligible projects under the expanded CMETC.

Green-tech manufacturers could see higher valuations as production credits lower costs and speed up scaling.

Why it matters: These credits aim to develop a full domestic clean-tech supply chain — from resource extraction to finished products — positioning Canada as a leader in EV and renewable manufacturing.

#4. Reclaim R&D spending through the SR&ED Program

The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credit remains one of Canada’s most generous incentives for innovation.

Budget 2025 confirms enhanced refundable credits of 35% on up to $3 million in annual R&D expenditures for small firms.

Tactics for small businesses include:

Track R&D-related labour, materials, and subcontractor costs meticulously — many companies underclaim eligible work.

Use the SR&ED refund to reinvest in intellectual property, automation, or scaling production.

Investor insight

Tech firms that lean on SR&ED can sustain innovation without excessive dilution or borrowing. Pay attention to management commentary in quarterly reports — firms that regularly claim SR&ED credits often show stronger long-term margins.

#5. Accessibility Credits as a Market Opportunity

The Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC) and Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) won’t directly apply to most businesses, but they create a strong consumer market signal: Canadians are spending to retrofit homes for accessibility and aging-in-place.

If you own or operate a firm that operates in the construction, renovation, or healthcare services business, then positioning your products to meet CRA’s eligible renovation list could increase demand and eligibility under these programs — and increase your firm's bottom line.

Investor insight

Companies producing modular ramps, adaptive construction materials, or smart-home medical tech are positioned for growth. Investors can look for suppliers or exchange-traded fund (ETFs) targeting senior housing, accessibility technology, or healthcare innovation.

#6. Shift from carbon rebates to business incentives

With the Canada Carbon Rebate winding down in 2025, the focus is shifting toward industrial decarbonization and business-led sustainability.

A good tactic for businesses is to audit your energy use — replacing high-emission equipment now can yield compounded savings under both clean-tech and productivity tax programs.

Investor insight

The policy pivot suggests a medium-term opportunity in industrial retrofits, energy auditing, and emissions tracking technology — all positioned for growth as carbon policy shifts toward enterprise responsibility.

Why it matters: Firms that invest early in emissions-reducing technology may now receive direct federal support, rather than consumers getting rebates at the pump.

Bottom line for investors and entrepreneurs

Budget 2025’s tax credits aren’t just fiscal fine print — they’re strategic tools for growth. Small businesses can immediately lower taxable income and fund expansion through targeted deductions and clean-tech incentives.

For investors, the winners will be those companies leveraging these programs to accelerate innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.

In short, Budget 2025 rewards proactive capital allocation — whether that’s a small firm investing in new equipment today, or a savvy investor backing the next generation of Canadian clean-tech leaders tomorrow.",https://media1.money.ca/a/137468/investors-and-small-businesses-budget-2025_social_media_thumbnail_1200x628_v20251104231210.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 06:58:51.502454

For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

“We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.” Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — For 30 years, world leaders and diplomats have gathered at United Nations negotiating sessions to try to curb climate change, but Earth’s temperature continues to rise and extreme weather worsens.

So this month, they’re hoping for fewer promises and more action.

Past pledges from nearly 200 nations have fallen far short and new plans submitted this year barely speed up pollution-fighting efforts, experts say. And if the numbers aren’t sobering enough for world leaders when they kick off the action Thursday, there’s the setting: Belem, a relatively poor city on the edge of a weakened Amazon.

Unlike past climate negotiations — and especially the one 10 years ago that forged the landmark Paris climate agreement — this annual U.N. conference isn’t primarily aimed at producing a grand deal or statement over its two weeks. Organizers and analysts frame this Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 — as the “implementation COP.”

“This is really going to be much more about what are we doing on the ground,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at limiting warming.

Figueres and many of more than three dozen experts interviewed by The Associated Press said negotiators have already pinned down the goal. What’s needed now is more money and political will for countries to put decades of words and promises into action and policy to reduce heat-trapping gases and stop deforestation. Only that will put the brakes on global warming as it careens toward a level the world has agreed is too dangerous, they say.

Adapting to a warmer world and saving forests

In Belem, diplomats, activists, scientists and business leaders will discuss new national climate-fighting plans, the need to save trees that absorb carbon pollution, how communities can adapt to warming and how to financially help developing nations hit hardest by climate change.

Host Brazil will preside and set the agenda. For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

Those leaders arrive Thursday for a two-day pre-meeting summit to discuss ratcheting up the fight against climate change.

“Holding COP in the Amazon itself creates a new level of accountability. You can’t talk about climate solutions while standing on the land that’s absorbing the planet’s carbon and ignore the people who protect it,” said Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada, and executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.

Top polluters won’t be at pre-summit

That high-level meeting is likely to be missing top leaders of the biggest carbon-polluting nations: China, the U.S. and India. They contribute about 52% of the world’s heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

China is sending its deputy premier. The U.S. is mostly skipping this conference under President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who’s begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement. Some U.S. cities and states are coming to show that they and businesses take climate change seriously, said former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who co-chairs a group called America Is All In.

Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. said it’s important world leaders understand the threat to countries like his: “Without the United States, without China, without India committing, we really have no hope.”

“We want to see action … particularly from the largest polluters,” Whipps said. “Our communities live on the front lines and we cannot afford more promises.”

Figueres said she hopes “because of the craziness in the United States that there is an expanded sense of, this is the moment to pull together.”

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told the AP he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Promising to cut more pollution or focusing on fulfilling pledges?

There’s already a divide on the nature of this meeting. Brazil is stressing implementation of past plans as well as what’s in new emissions-cutting plans submitted this year. But smaller island nations, such as Palau, and scientists are saying that’s not enough. It dooms Earth to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, they said.

Palau and other island nations want negotiators to tell countries to be more ambitious in their new carbon pollution-cutting plans.

Implementing “mediocrity,” said Natural Resources Defense Council adaptation chief Adelle Thomas, “is not creating a future for vulnerable nations.”

But if nations do what they’ve already promised in past climate-fighting plans, it could trim an entire degree Celsius — 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit — from projected warming, said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of World Resources Institute. Scientists agreed with the estimate. Dasgupta said negotiators have too long focused on big commitments instead of outcomes in the real economy, which he said is “the messier thing” that doesn’t get headlines.

“What we now need to do is deliver against what we have signed on to,” said scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany.

Path to disaster or optimism?

“The challenge today is not whether we will phase out fossil fuels. The challenge today is will we be too late?” Rockstrom said. “We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.”

Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad. But she co-founded an a organization called Global Optimism and said she’s sure the world can do this.

“My optimism is not naive. I know what we’re up against,” she said. “But my optimism is about determination. It’s about we’re up against a really, really, really challenging threat here. And we don’t give up.”

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions.
Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide.
People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.
With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When summer heat comes to the Arara neighborhood in northern Rio, it lingers, baking the red brick and concrete that make up many of the buildings long after the sun has gone down. Luis Cassiano, who’s lived here more than 30 years, says he’s getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.

In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning — Cassiano is one — can’t always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor’s, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.

“The sun in the summer nowadays is scary,” Cassiano said.

As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.

All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.

That’s why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.

“I am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts

It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.

People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.

They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.

“It’s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don’t have savings, that’s really devastating,” Brandon said.

Crop yields suffer in many places, but worst in poor countries

Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.

But poorer countries will be more severely affected, said Heriberto Tapia, head of research and strategic partnerships advisor at the UNDP Human Development Report Office.

Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.

Most of the world’s 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.

Elouafi thinks technology can help ease the climate pressure on many of those farmers, but also noted that many can’t afford it. She’s not confident that this year’s COP will provide enough money to help with that.

Will holding COP30 in the Global South make a difference?

Brazilian officials thought Belem, on the edge of the Amazon and not a rich city, would be a forceful reminder for negotiators of the difficulty that climate change and rising extreme weather are bringing to millions of people every day.

“I heard there were a lot of negotiators who have been complaining of being put on a bunk bed, or in terms of sharing a room, but this is the reality of most people around the world,” said Nafkote Dabi, climate policy lead at global development organization Oxfam. “So I think it makes things real.”

But some experts were skeptical, despite the recent UNDP report saying the need to take action is urgent.

“I wish that they had said more about what exactly is the rapid action that needs to be taken, because I don’t think rapid action is going to come out of COP,” said Kimberly Marion Suiseeya, an associate professor at Duke University who studies how international policies impact people in rural and forested areas.

With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?

Although the public narrative has long been that humankind has generally been making progress on alleviating poverty, numbers show that now there’s a “stagnation,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the Human Development Report Office at the UNDP. “The numbers are high and they are not budging.”

In a memo ahead of COP30, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called for a shift from prioritizing reducing emissions to focus on reducing human suffering. On climate change, “there’s no apocalyptic story for rich countries,” he said. “The place where it gets really tough is in these poor countries.”

But Conceição said it’s wrong to think about poverty reduction and climate as a tradeoff.

The idea that climate is only a future problem, “or it’s about things out there like glaciers melting, needs to be completely thrown out and replaced with the notion that actually the two agendas are one and the same,” he said.

The industry’s exponential growth is shaking up U.S. auto manufacturing on the national scale as well: Last year, for the second time, international automakers outproduced the Detroit automakers.
Put another way: international automakers are a catalyst for creating jobs in the Carolinas.
This prosperity is demonstrated by the exponential growth international automakers have experienced within the last 20 years.
Specifically, in the Carolinas, international automakers have four manufacturing facilities, two research & development facilities, and 476 dealerships, contributing over $18 billion to North and South Carolina’s economies in 2024.","Thanks to international automakers, the Carolinas are in the midst of a manufacturing transformation. From Toyota’s new electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina set to open later this year and employ over 5,000 Americans, to BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina, which is the largest BMW plant in the world, international automakers have doubled down on investment with a direct, sizable economic impact and benefit to North and South Carolina.

The industry’s exponential growth is shaking up U.S. auto manufacturing on the national scale as well: Last year, for the second time, international automakers outproduced the Detroit automakers.

Put another way: international automakers are a catalyst for creating jobs in the Carolinas. The latest data from Autos Drive America reveals that international automakers directly employ more than 160,000 Americans, including 17,000 across North and South Carolina alone. In 2024, international automakers produced 4.9 million vehicles in the U.S., of which, over 460,000 were produced right here. These aren’t just cars for American consumers—10 U.S.-made models built in the Carolinas were exported to more than 130 countries, contributing to $31 billion in export revenue.

But it’s important to remember that these gains are not guaranteed. They are the direct result of a robust international trade system that allows companies to invest in the U.S. and export to the world. Manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are better for it.

Over the last few decades, politicians from both sides of the aisle continue to talk about how to bring better-paying manufacturing jobs to the U.S. The answer lies in continuing to embrace international trade, not shying away from it. Restricting trade won’t build cars or create the supply chains of the future—international partnerships will. The ability for U.S. manufacturers to sell abroad, just as international companies build and sell here, creates a prosperous cycle of economic growth for the U.S.

This prosperity is demonstrated by the exponential growth international automakers have experienced within the last 20 years. With $124 billion invested in their U.S. operations and 31 manufacturing facilities located across the country, international automakers are leading the industry while simultaneously creating thousands of American manufacturing jobs. Specifically, in the Carolinas, international automakers have four manufacturing facilities, two research & development facilities, and 476 dealerships, contributing over $18 billion to North and South Carolina’s economies in 2024.

To continue this leadership, policymakers must prioritize expanding and modernizing trade agreements. Strengthening our partnerships and fostering new trade deals will ensure that the U.S. economy remains competitive in the ever-changing global marketplace. And working to open valuable markets for American-made vehicles, parts, and other products—like in the European Union and the Indo-Pacific—would drive our export growth and support high-quality domestic manufacturing jobs.

As we reflect on Manufacturing Month this past October, we must recognize the contributions that international automakers have made to our national manufacturing ecosystem and our own local Carolina communities, and how they’re leading the way forward.

Electricity prices have been rising across much of the country, and Illinois is among the states seeing the sharpest increases. Over the past five years, prices have shot up by about a third on average across the state, and some regions have seen increases of nearly 50 percent. According to the Illinois Commerce Commission, more than 170,000 disconnection notices were mailed out in June alone — that’s up from approximately 46,000 for the same time last year.

In response to the skyrocketing utility bills, Illinois lawmakers passed a sweeping energy reform package last week. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA, is expected to flood the grid with more power and bets big on battery storage. In a landmark shift, lawmakers also lifted the state’s nearly four-decade-old moratorium on the construction of new large-scale nuclear reactors in Illinois. The state legislature passed a law two years ago making an exception for small modular reactors. Nuclear power already provides more than 50 percent of the state’s energy mix. The state currently relies on a mix of fossil fuels and renewables for the rest of its energy, with solar and wind making up roughly 13 percent of the

To finance the buildout, Illinois ratepayers will face a surcharge on their electricity bills beginning in 2030. An analysis from the Illinois Power Agency, which manages how the state procures its electricity supply, found the program will cost approximately $1 billion to execute but will save consumers more than $13 billion over 20 years.

The bill comes as the state’s electrical system is in a crunch driven by a surge in demand from power-hungry data centers, a state law promising to phase out fossil fuel use for generating electricity, and federal funding cuts for clean energy. State lawmakers passed the bill during the last two days of an October legislative session, and Governor JB Pritzker has pledged to sign the bill.

Illinois is the first state to take significant climate action since President Donald Trump retook office, said Andrew Linhares with the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group that advocates for solar power and energy storage.

“It is a response to the attack on clean energy and attack on Illinois consumers that is represented by the One Big Beautiful Bill, which is going to have the impact of raising prices on all Americans,” he said.

President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, provided tax credits and other incentives to help accelerate the transition to cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar and put the country on the path to net-zero carbon emissions. Illinois was expected to receive approximately $1 billion through the law. But the federal incentives didn’t last long. Earlier this summer, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which ended the climate-friendly tax credits. Energy analysts have predicted that the loss of those tax credits and other incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act will result in as much as $250 more in energy costs per year per household.

Trump, who has called climate change “a giant hoax,” also cancelled nearly $600 million in grants for Illinois earlier this month aimed at modernizing the state’s grid and catching leaks of methane, a planet-warming gas. Linhares said that the administration’s pro-fossil fuel agenda has spooked investors from clean energy.

The new bill tasks the Illinois Power Agency with drawing up a plan to incentivize developers to bring 3 gigawatts of additional battery storage capacity onto the grid. Batteries are crucial for a grid shifting toward renewable energy as they absorb excess electricity during the day when prices are low and save it for later when prices spike.

“It’s an incredibly exciting investment in climate progress,” Jen Walling with the Illinois Environmental Coalition said, adding that the bill does far more than fund batteries. It also dedicates funding for home energy efficiency programs, geothermal energy, and thermal energy network pilots, and helps expand electric vehicle charging stations. The new legislation also includes new authorities for the state’s utility regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission, to make long-term plans about the state’s electrical supply.

Earlier this summer, Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook, inked a 20-year deal to buy the entire electrical output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton nuclear plant in central Illinois to power its AI boom beginning in 2027. Constellation signed a similar deal last year with Microsoft to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility to power its Pennsylvania data centers.

Communities across the country have pointed to the rise of the always-on, power-hungry data centers to explain runaway electricity bills in recent years. But a recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the toll of data centers can vary from state to state.

“This is a very nuanced situation,” said Ryan Hledik with the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm that contributed to the study. States like Virginia and North Dakota have seen tremendous growth in data centers without seeing increasing rates. The picture is less clear statewide in Illinois, but ComEd, which distributes electricity to the northern half of the state, is estimating an increase in demand by 40 percent by 2040 due in part to the data center boom. Whether it will translate to an increase in residential electricity costs remains to be seen.

Nationally, a key factor pushing rates upward is the rising cost of modernizing the aging distribution system — the power lines, poles, substations, and transformers that deliver power — and protecting it against climate change-fueled natural disasters. Nevertheless, the fundamental imbalance between supply and demand remains.

“What we are seeing is that as utilities or markets are running out of spare capacity, new investments are going to need to be made to continue to support load growth,” Hledik said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Power-Lines_sized-min.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-05 06:58:57.164052

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada's prosperity for decades are being reshaped - threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound-hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

""Let's accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.""

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation's future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them - to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home - stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren't receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the 'trickle down' ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada's future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country's future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund - allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition - from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

""Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.''

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

""Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.""

That recognition matters - because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That's the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That's why this budget charts a new course for Canada's public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada's future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada's new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government's Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity -doing more with less - because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada's position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy - starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what's necessary - and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan -the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities - they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation - ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada's North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we'll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods - this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres - this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Becancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers - a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That's the way to go!

That's what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called ""Minister of Everything"" at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians - and neither are we.

This budget is guided by the conviction that Canada must remain a nation of builders - of infrastructure and innovation, of trust in public institutions, and of hope for generations to come.

This nation knows how to build:

We built the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, allowing our country to be connected from coast to coast and supporting trade across the Prairies;

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world's top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada's next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings - a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It's about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That's what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We've launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I'm sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada's defence industry - strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure - like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home - creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada's strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada's reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

It's about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada's productivity has been lagging - a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing - turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development - and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada's debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels - allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada's natural wealth - critical minerals, clean power - into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada's energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits - measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada's economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, ""these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada's economic strategy"".

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation - a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision - one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people's pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians - to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it's about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It's about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let's rise to this generational challenge.

Let's build Canada strong.

Because we are - and always will be - the true North, strong and free.

LONG LIVE CANADA!

Check against delivery

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada's prosperity for decades are being reshaped - threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound-hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

""Let's accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.""

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation's future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them - to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home - stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren't receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the 'trickle down' ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada's future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country's future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund - allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition - from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

""Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.''

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

""Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.""

That recognition matters - because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That's the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That's why this budget charts a new course for Canada's public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada's future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada's new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government's Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity -doing more with less - because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada's position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy - starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what's necessary - and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan -the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities - they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation - ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada's North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we'll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods - this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres - this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Becancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers - a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That's the way to go!

That's what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called ""Minister of Everything"" at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians - and neither are we.

This budget is guided by the conviction that Canada must remain a nation of builders - of infrastructure and innovation, of trust in public institutions, and of hope for generations to come.

This nation knows how to build:

We built the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, allowing our country to be connected from coast to coast and supporting trade across the Prairies;

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world's top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada's next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings - a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It's about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That's what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We've launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I'm sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada's defence industry - strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure - like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home - creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada's strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada's reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

It's about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada's productivity has been lagging - a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing - turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development - and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada's debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels - allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada's natural wealth - critical minerals, clean power - into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada's energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits - measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada's economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, ""these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada's economic strategy"".

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation - a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision - one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people's pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians - to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it's about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It's about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let's rise to this generational challenge.

Let's build Canada strong.

Because we are - and always will be - the true North, strong and free.

Date: November 4, 2025

Subject: Rising energy costs dominated the ballot in 2025—and created a playbook for Democratic candidates in 2026

Today, Democratic candidates prevailed and won critical elections in New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia and New York City. The winning candidates represented the full ideological spectrum of the Democratic Party but were united by a common theme – addressing the rising cost of living for the American people. In each of these races, Democrats stayed on offense on affordability with skyrocketing utility bills becoming a key campaign issue in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia.

Democratic candidates won by hammering Trump and Republicans on rising costs, including their reckless war on clean energy. To win in 2026, candidates should remain on offense on costs and position energy prices, along with issues like health care, at the center of their messaging, making clear that Trump and Republicans are responsible for raising electricity bills by taking affordable, reliable clean energy off the grid. The contrast is clear—Democrats want to bring cheaper energy online faster to drive down costs, while Republicans are taking energy options offline to benefit their billionaire donors and spike costs for everyone else.

How Democratic Candidates Won on Energy Costs in 2025

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia have felt the acute pain of soaring energy prices:

New Jersey residents saw a 22.21% increase between July 2024 and 2025.

Virginians saw an average 11.25% increase in their utility bills since last year.

Georgians using the largest utility provider in the state saw their bills increase $518 in each of the last two years.

Democratic candidates, in each of these states, successfully positioned energy prices as a central pillar of their affordability-focused campaign—outlining a clear path to lower costs while holding Republicans accountable for their harmful agenda that raised them.

In New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill made lowering energy prices central to her campaign for governor, pairing an aggressive clean energy plan with relentless attacks on Trump and Republicans for cutting cheaper, faster clean energy. The contrast was clear: While Sherrill’s campaign focused on freezing electricity costs, Ciattarelli and Republicans attacked clean energy projects that would bring more energy to the grid quickly. In a recent Fox News poll on the race, in which Sherrill led with likely voters by 52-45, she had a 10-point lead on energy costs (54-44), up from just 3 points in mid-October. Exit polls in New Jersey found that 59% of voters viewed electricity costs as a major problem and only 12% said no problem at all.

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger centered energy affordability in her campaign for governor, combining her own plan to tackle rising energy costs with direct attacks on Trump’s clean energy cuts, while Winsome Earle-Sears parroted Trump’s attacks on clean energy. Spanberger criticized Trump for gutting energy investments in Virginia, raising energy prices through the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” and slashing jobs and critical projects in the state. Meanwhile, Earle-Sears attacked cheaper, reliable, clean energy and said that she supported the president as Trump slashed and threatened jobs in her own state. The Virginia debate also presaged another emerging theme: the exponential increase in energy demand from data centers that makes Republican cuts to our energy supply even more catastrophic for Americans’ utility bills.

In Georgia, for the first time in almost 20 years, two Democratic candidates will hold seats on the Public Service Commission. The Commission regulates utilities and dictates how to meet energy demand. The Democratic candidates, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, challenged two Republican incumbents by aggressively highlighting the soaring energy cost crisis under state Republicans—and pledging to increase clean energy. The race garnered national attention as voters expressed frustration toward the Republican-led Commission for hiking rates six separate times in the past two years.

A Winning Playbook for 2026

These outcomes did not happen in a vacuum: electricity rates have risen 11% nationally under Trump, and voters across the country are increasingly citing energy costs as a top concern. The race is on to win the fight over blame, with Republicans like Steve Bannon already pointing to energy costs as a key electoral flashpoint. These electoral results serve as a framework one year ahead of the midterms: As part of the focus on affordability, Democratic candidates can make a clear, coherent, and assertive case that Republicans are driving up energy costs by canceling clean energy projects.

Notably, both Sherrill and Spanberger found success directly tying rising utility costs to Republicans’ clean energy cuts, a valuable blueprint for candidates looking to connect with voters on this issue. Despite the Republican candidate being better known and having come within 4 points of winning the governorship before, Sherrill was able to beat back blatantly false attacks, part of the more than $12 million Republicans spent on ads mentioning energy prices. By centering costs and including energy in the story of an increasingly expensive American life, Democratic candidates can connect with voters and win in 2026.

Voters just drew a line in the sand: they want lower energy bills and real solutions—not more politics and excuses. Republicans will attempt to course-correct by blaming Democrats for soaring energy costs. However, Republicans’ attacks on clean energy over the last year are indefensible: Trump’s war on clean energy has made energy more expensive, cut more than 158,000 clean energy jobs (nearly half of which are in Republican districts), and jeopardized $24 billion in energy projects and over 338,000 jobs. While Republicans will try to hide from their disqualifying records, a successful 2026 strategy effectively and aggressively holds them accountable. Democrats’ 2026 strategy must make one thing crystal clear: Republicans broke our path to cheaper, faster and clean energy—and voters are paying the price.

Both women outperformed already sky-high expectations to categorically trounce their Trump-aligned Republican opponents.

In two races defined by the cost-of-living crisis, both governors-elect ran, won, and achieved decisive victories by championing energy affordability and successfully defining their opponents on energy costs. In the face of direct attacks from Donald Trump and his allies, they earned voters’ trust with common-sense plans to lower costs, take on broken systems that stack the cards against working people, and expand clean energy in their states.

Their historic victories offer a clear playbook for Democrats searching for a winning strategy ahead of next year’s midterms. Here’s how they did it:

Go Big on Clean Energy Affordability

Ratepayers in both New Jersey and Virginia have faced brutal price hikes—and there was no shying away from that reality in these elections. Gubernatorial candidates in both parties focused a significant portion of their messages to voters on energy costs, but the candidates backing clean energy had the clear advantage.

Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey

In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill made fighting rising energy costs a centerpiece of her campaign:

Her platform promised to drive down utility costs with bold action to “massively build out cheaper and cleaner power generation” and “require more transparency"" from utilities and PJM, New Jersey’s grid operator.

In the final weeks of the race, Sherrill’s campaign ran multiple ads highlighting her commitment to a Day One Emergency Declaration on Utility Costs.

On the campaign trail, Sherrill spoke directly to voters about how PJM's failures have contributed to rising rates, how Trump and Jack Ciattarelli’s anti-clean-energy tax bill is making the problem worse, and how she would use clean energy to curb out-of-control costs.

Sherrill decided to go on offense on energy affordability—and it paid off. She defined the issue in the race and put forward common-sense solutions that helped her secure key endorsements and gain a commanding ten-point lead over her opponent in voter trust on energy costs.

It’s Time for Democrats to Go on Offense With Clean Energy

Deploying clean energy is the cheapest, fastest way to get more power on the grid and drive down costs. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have torched their credibility on energy affordability with their crusade against clean energy projects and investment across the country. One recent poll from Global Strategy Group found that when voters learned of Republican attacks on clean energy, it shifted the generic congressional ballot by 18 points toward Democrats. The Sherrill and Spanberger campaigns leveraged their opponents’ weakness and turned it into a signature strength by offering a better, more affordable path forward.

Meanwhile, two Democratic candidates for the Georgia Public Service Commission delivered the party’s first victories for a statewide constitutional office in Georgia since 2006 by framing the election as a referendum on rising energy bills.

Voters across the country spoke loud and clear: They want leaders who will go big on clean energy deployment and hold utilities and grid operators accountable. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger showed us how to answer the call—now it’s up to them to deliver, and for leaders across the country to take up the mantle.

The urgency of this issue has intensified in recent weeks following a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions. On October 10, 2025, President Trump announced plans to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, in response to China’s new restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports. This announcement triggered a global market sell-off and heightened concerns about supply chain disruptions in the renewable energy sector – the imposed tariffs will particularly have acute impacts on solar, battery storage, and wind component costs. China has countered with its own measures, including new port fees and sanctions on foreign companies, further complicating the trade landscape. Given these developments, this article outlines several approaches that sponsors and financing parties can use to manage tariff-related risks, spanning contractual structuring, financial modeling and structuring, and strategic planning.

For Sponsors:

Tariff Risk-Sharing Clauses in Project Documents

Sponsors can embed tariff-specific provisions into EPC, supply, and O&M agreements. Ideally, to shield themselves—and by extension, lenders—from cost volatility, sponsors would secure fixed-price contracts and allocate as much tariff risk as possible to suppliers or EPC contractors. However, in today’s tariff environment, a balanced approach is often more commercially feasible. For example, one party may assume tariff risk up to a certain threshold (either in absolute dollar terms or as a percentage), after which the other party shares in the tariff burden. Beyond a second threshold, either or both parties may have termination rights. Some sponsors have also successfully negotiated limited tariff risk-sharing with offtakers. Example structures include enabling the sponsor to seek a defined contract price increase if its costs exceed an agreed-upon threshold by automatic right, with anything above that threshold requiring joint approval with the offtaker. Further, should joint agreement not be possible, the sponsor sometimes has an early termination right (often coupled with a termination fee) if the project just isn’t economic.

Maximizing Other Incentives

Given the volatility and potential rise in tariffs, sponsors should maximize the use of government incentives, tax credits, and subsidies to offset tariff-related costs. Monitoring policy developments is crucial. Sourcing components domestically or investing in domestic manufacturing can help sponsors bypass tariffs and reduce the compliance burden related to “foreign entity of concern” rules under tax credit regimes. Exploring alternative technologies or renewable solutions not currently subject to tariffs may also yield better tariff treatment and unlock eligibility for tax credits unaffected by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To learn more about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and recent guidance, please see here and here.

Strategic Partnerships and Supply Chain Diversification

Sponsors may benefit from building relationships with suppliers across multiple countries to reduce dependency on tariff-affected nations. Forming strategic partnerships with global renewable energy firms can enhance negotiating power. Collaborating with industry groups and leveraging advocacy channels can also help push for regulatory clarity, stability, and potential tariff exemptions for renewable components.

Financing Structures and Insurance Protections

Sponsors may also consider mezzanine financing or hybrid debt instruments to provide flexibility amid tariff-induced cost fluctuations by providing sponsors with liquidity to make quick buying decisions when pricing is more advantageous. Project refinancing strategies can also help adapt to changing tariff environments. Additionally, specialized tariff or political risk insurance can protect projects from sudden tariff implementation or escalation. Such insurance products, typically offered by multilateral agencies, export credit institutions, or private insurers, can be structured to protect the insured project or portfolio from financial losses arising from unforeseen tariff imposition, increases in existing tariffs, or other trade‑restrictive measures implemented by host or foreign governments. This coverage can be critical for projects with cross‑border supply chains, imported equipment, or raw materials subject to international commodity flows.

For Financing Parties:

From the financing side, existing protections often include indemnity carve-outs that prioritize lender repayment over sponsor obligations, ensuring indemnities sit below debt service in the cash waterfall. Financing parties may also:

Incorporate additional deadline cushions.

Request sponsor certifications regarding AD/CVD and tariff risks.

Require tariff-specific contingency reserves or guarantees to cover tariff-related cost increases.

Assess sponsor creditworthiness (e.g., financial disclosures, minimum liquidity).

Consider requesting equity contribution agreements or secured guarantees.

Request tariff contingencies in financial models and/or special insurance coverage.

Ultimately, financing parties should be responsive to the kinds of mitigants that the applicable sponsor has been able to obtain in its project contracts for tariff risks.

As the global trade landscape continues to shift, tariff exposure will remain a critical consideration in project development and financing. By proactively embedding risk-sharing mechanisms, leveraging policy incentives, and aligning financial structures with evolving regulatory realities, both sponsors and financing parties can better navigate uncertainty and safeguard project viability. A thoughtful, collaborative approach to tariff risk management not only strengthens individual projects but also contributes to the resilience of the broader renewable energy ecosystem.

Capacity is divided among private and school behind-the-meter systems as well as multiple types of community solar.
Traditional community solar gains 213 MW, “community-driven” projects 36 MW, public schools 107 MW, and “Equity-Eligible Contractor” projects 233 MW.
She pointed to a recent study showing that PLA processes can actually lower bid prices on solar projects.
Speaking with pv magazine USA, McFadden said solar and storage developers should pay close attention to two key items: the community solar energy storage adder and the new inflation adjustment for RPS revenue.","llinois’ Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act (SB 25) has passed both chambers of the legislature and now awaits the governor’s signature. The bill, among other provisions, sets a 3 GW solar goal, creates Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and Time-of-Use programs, and requires Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for community-solar projects 3 MWac and larger.

In parallel, after advocacy from stakeholders—including Michael R. Strong of Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll—the state’s Illinois Shines program is reopening for a new round of capacity to accelerate deployment amid the phase-down of the 30% federal solar tax credit.

The Illinois Shines Adjustable Block Program will expand the 2025–26 program year by 873 MW of new capacity. Unused prior-year allocations will be distributed to wait-listed projects that did not make the upcoming lottery.

Capacity is divided among private and school behind-the-meter systems as well as multiple types of community solar. Systems under and over 25 kWac—the cutoff between small and large distributed generation—each receive 142 MW of new capacity. Traditional community solar gains 213 MW, “community-driven” projects 36 MW, public schools 107 MW, and “Equity-Eligible Contractor” projects 233 MW.

Maria Bries, a deal lawyer at Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll, highlighted the new requirement for PLAs before incentives are awarded to projects larger than 3 MWac. She pointed to a recent study showing that PLA processes can actually lower bid prices on solar projects. Bries told pv magazine USA:

“Since Governor Pritzker’s Executive Order in 2019 requiring project labor agreements for public works projects, it has been a sticking point with county boards across the state that community solar developers under Illinois Shines were excluded. The support of labor unions was critical to get CRGA across the finish line in record time, and PLAs will ensure a less contentious permitting process, not to mention more competitive bids and diverse workforce as recent research in Illinois has proven.”

In a broader energy package, legislators also passed the omnibus bill SB 25—essentially the “cake” beneath the solar “icing.”

Key provisions include a 3 GW energy-storage target, a statewide VPP program, community-solar storage rebates, and inflation adjustments to Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) pricing to reflect real-world cost trends.

According to analysis provided to pv magazine USA by Kady McFadden, of McFadden Strategies, the legislation also includes a lengthy list of additional clean-energy policies:

– Public Integrated Resource Planning for the state’s cooperative utilities to improve grid consistency.

– Updated energy-efficiency goals for utilities.

– Consideration of a social cost of carbon in state planning.

– The first steps toward a Solar Bill of Rights.

– Time-of-Use pricing structures.

Speaking with pv magazine USA, McFadden said solar and storage developers should pay close attention to two key items: the community solar energy storage adder and the new inflation adjustment for RPS revenue.

The prior, offering $250 per kWh of nameplate storage—could raise community solar capacity factors and energy output (via increased module installations) by up to 30%, making it financially viable to store excess solar generation for later use. The latter, she said, could add roughly 1.8 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind capacity simply by aligning incentives with actual cost increases.

Several nuclear-energy provisions were included as well—some favoring nuclear, others supporting solar. Illinois, which currently generates about 53% of its electricity from nuclear, fully lifted its moratorium on new nuclear construction. Earlier legislation had only lifted the ban for plants under 300 MW; this new change removes it entirely.

Meanwhile, an existing subsidy for nuclear plants is being phased out as planned, but rather than ending altogether, its funding will be redirected to support additional clean-energy deployment.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FlexGen.png,N,,2025-11-05 04:58:45.299259

The real game-changers might be two lesser-known technologies: Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and hydrogen.

Together, CCUS and hydrogen are being hailed as the ""last-mile"" solutions to slash emissions that can't be avoided, especially in heavy industries like steel, cement, and petrochemicals. These sectors are the backbone of the economy, but also among the hardest to clean up.

These two technologies of the future are the missing pieces to help the world -- and Thailand -- reach its carbon neutrality and net-zero targets.

In short, to save the planet and humanity.

The catch? They're still very costly and stuck in a tangle of policies and legal gaps. But if Thailand wants a truly low-carbon future, these two technologies might just be the keys to getting there.

How CCUS works

CCUS works by capturing carbon dioxide (CO₂) before it escapes into the air -- usually from factory chimneys or other emission sources. The captured gas is then stored deep underground in layers of rock or put to use in other ways, such as being processed into new materials or reused in the energy and petrochemical industries.

Around the world, this technology captures about 400 million tonnes of carbon each year, still a drop in the ocean compared to total emissions.

Some countries are moving fast. In the United States, the Gulf Coast industrial cluster now traps more than 20 million tonnes of CO₂ a year, with plans to scale up sevenfold to 140 million tonnes.

This progress didn't happen by accident. It's driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which gives companies up to US$85 in tax credit for every tonne of carbon they capture. Capturing one tonne of carbon can cost anywhere between $15 and $120, depending on the emission source.

Without tax incentives from the government, CCUS would be too costly and economically unviable.

Thailand also has potential. A study by the Global CCS Institute suggests the Gulf of Thailand could store more than 8.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is enough to keep emissions safely locked away for decades.

But CCUS won't take off in Thailand unless the government get four things right.

First, it needs to set clear national CCUS targets that fit with the country's net-zero goals. Second, there should be one government body in charge, with proper laws and rules covering every step of the value chain.

Third, investors need a reason to get on board. They need financial support and incentives that make the effort worthwhile. And most importantly, Thailand needs a fair carbon price, so the market itself starts pushing the change.

Green Hydrogen

While CCUS tackles emissions that can't be avoided, hydrogen offers a path to cleaner fuel. When burned or used in fuel cells, hydrogen releases no carbon at all. Hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen made with renewable energy, can even store power for weeks to solve one of the biggest problems of solar and wind energy: their instability.

Many developed countries are racing ahead with hydrogen technology. Germany is building a 1,200-kilometre hydrogen pipeline network to connect industries across the country by 2030.

Japan has had a hydrogen strategy since 2017 and recently passed new laws -- the GX Promotion Act (2023) and Hydrogen Society Promotion Act (2024) -- to speed up real-world use, including testing ships that carry liquid hydrogen. Meanwhile, Australia aims to become a major hydrogen exporter, starting with hydrogen made from coal and CCUS, and moving to full-scale green hydrogen by 2030.

Thailand has started to move too. There are plans to test green hydrogen mixed with natural gas to generate electricity, but that may not be efficient in the long run. Making hydrogen from clean electricity only to turn it back into power wastes energy at several stages. A better use would be in heavy transport as fuel for trucks, buses, and cargo ships that need steady, high power. There are several pilot projects in the heavy transport sector. For example, the state energy firm PTT aims to produce green hydrogen and build filling stations to serve 30-50 hydrogen-powered trucks. A Thai–Japanese partnership is also testing 20 trucks that can run more than 600 kilometres a day on hydrogen fuel cells.

But cost remains a major roadblock. Green hydrogen now costs 280 to 340 baht per kilogramme. To compete with diesel, it must drop to around 200. Domestic demand is still weak too, as Thailand lacks both infrastructure and a clear policy direction. Thailand is taking its first steps into the hydrogen era. The progress is small but promising. Still, without faster action, the country risks becoming just an importer of hydrogen rather than a developer that can add value and create jobs at home.

To make hydrogen part of the real economy, Thailand needs to move on several fronts.

Green hydrogen should first be used in heavy transport -- trucks, buses, and ships that need powerful, continuous energy. The government also needs to set clear safety standards and update the rules to officially allow hydrogen as a fuel.

Costs have to come down, too, so green hydrogen can compete with diesel. And to make it practical, Thailand must expand its refuelling network, attract private investment, and fund more research and development.

Both CCUS and hydrogen hold enormous promise. But that promise will remain out of reach without clear long-term goals, coherent policies, strong laws, and the right financial incentives.

The sooner Thailand invests in these technologies of the future, the greater its chance of shaping, not just surviving, the world's next energy revolution.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/11/05/5837209_700.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:59:06.076940

The investment in Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies is the latest stake taken by the U.S. in a handful of private companies — including another rare earths company and chipmaker Intel — since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. The White House has made it a priority to bolster the nation's supply chain in a market dominated by China.

Vulcan Elements manufactures rare earth magnets, while ReElement processes rare earth mineral ores and recycles old batteries and other products made with rare earths.

Rare earths are used in fighter jets, guided missiles, drones and nuclear submarines as well as smartphones and wind turbines.

The influx of cash will allow Vulcan and ReElement to ramp up their annual magnet production to 10,000 tonnes annually, the companies said.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

The deal announced this week comes just days after Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed to cut tariffs on China, which Beijing reciprocated by allowing the export of rare earth elements.

Before Xi and Trump met last week, China had imposed restrictions that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China, even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies. However, it didn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his initial round of tariffs.

China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

The deal includes a $620 million loan from the Department of Defense, $50 million of federal incentives from the Department of Commerce and $550 million in private capital.

The Defense Department will receive warrants in both Vulcan and ReElement, with Commerce getting a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan.

In July, the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine. The unusual direct investment in the company made the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials.

A week later, MP Materials announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.

U.S. Steel, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals are among the companies the U.S. government has taken equity stakes in under Trump.

Those investments have drawn skepticism from economists, former government officials and even members of the president’s own party.

India is transforming into a global manufacturing hub, attracting high-value production, research, and exports from advanced economies. Companies like Ford and HP are leveraging India's skilled workforce, policy incentives, and geopolitical realignments to establish it as a strategic production base, moving beyond just local consumption.

Over the past few years, India has been steadily transforming from a large consumer market into a global manufacturing hub. But recent announcements indicate a deeper shift. Companies from the world’s most advanced industrial economies are not merely assembling products in India for local consumption but are increasingly using India as a base for high-value production, research and exports. This movement underlines India’s growing strategic importance on the global manufacturing map, driven by a blend of policy incentives, geopolitical realignments and the sheer scale of its skilled labour force.

From domestic pressure to global pragmatism

Ford’s latest move exemplifies how multinational corporations are balancing local political pressures with global business realities. The company recently announced that its Chennai plant in Tamil Nadu will be retooled to produce high-end engines for export markets, with an annual capacity of over 235,000 units. Interestingly, these engines will not be shipped to the United States, a subtle but telling detail. Even as U.S. President Donald Trump had long championed reshoring and domestic production, companies like Ford recognise that competitive manufacturing costs and supply chain resilience increasingly lie beyond American borders.

India offers a compelling alternative. It provides a relatively stable political environment, a large engineering talent pool and improving logistics infrastructure. Ford’s investment also signals confidence in India’s manufacturing ecosystem, especially in the automotive and components sector, where India has already established itself as a global supplier to markets in Europe, Africa and Asia.

HP bets on local value chains

The American tech giant HP’s plans to make all its laptops in India mark a significant evolution in the electronics manufacturing landscape. HP’s CEO Enrique Lores, in a recent interview with The Economic Times, stated that within three to five years, all personal computers sold in India will be produced locally, and eventually, exports too will originate from Indian plants.

This decision aligns with India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, which have been specifically designed to attract large-scale electronics manufacturing. It also reflects the government’s broader Make in India and Digital India ambitions, which aim to deepen domestic value chains in high-tech sectors. For HP, the move offers dual advantages: it localises production in one of its largest markets and positions India as a competitive export hub in the global PC ecosystem, potentially replacing or supplementing China and Southeast Asian countries.

The Korean confidence

While American companies are expanding manufacturing for strategic cost reasons, South Korean firms seem to be betting on India for long-term industrial and technological integration. LG Electronics, one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates, is reportedly exploring shifting production of capital goods, which are used to set up electronic product and display factories, from Korea, China and Vietnam to India.

This signals a shift beyond consumer electronics to higher-value manufacturing and industrial technology. Simultaneously, LG Corp, the group’s holding company, is investing Rs 1,000 crore to establish a global research and development center in Noida, expected to employ about 500 people. This dual focus, on both manufacturing and R&D, illustrates how South Korean conglomerates increasingly view India not just as a market or a cost-efficient factory floor, but as a full-fledged innovation and production ecosystem.

Analysts in Seoul attribute this interest to multiple factors such as India’s large pool of technical professionals, growing government support and an emerging geopolitical logic that encourages diversification away from China. As Sunwoo Kim of Meritz Securities notes, “Various Korean tech companies have reviewed entry into India over the past few years, primarily due to abundant human resources, government subsidies and geopolitical issues.”

Policy, people and politics

Three forces underpin this global tilt toward India. First, the government’s consistent industrial policy anchored in schemes such as Make in India, PLI schemes and Atmanirbhar Bharat, has created a strong policy push for localisation. Second, India’s demographic dividend continues to be one of its biggest draws. Its young, technically skilled, English-speaking workforce can operate across design, production and digital integration. Third, the shifting geopolitical landscape, marked by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and a broader global appetite for supply chain diversification, has made India a strategic hedge for multinational corporations.

The convergence of these factors allows India to occupy a unique position of not being a low-cost substitute for China, but a parallel centre of manufacturing competence capable of serving global markets.

""Tesla is expected to integrate the cells into its own Megapack ESS products.""

Australia is a sunny place. It’s kind of known for it. It’s the sunniest continent, and the sunniest country outside of the Middle East/Africa, with extensive photovoltaic power potential across its entire territory.

In recognition of that, Australia has been installing lots of solar power. Formerly a coal-heavy nation (for which coal is still its 2nd-largest export), solar and wind have rapidly taken over Australia’s electricity grid, pushing coal and methane gas out of the equation.

This has taken a big chunk out of Australia’s electricity-related climate emissions, and of course resulted in clean air benefits as dirty coal is pushed out of the grid. And climate emissions matter a lot for Australia, a country that is becoming more unbearably hot and suffering more fires due to climate change. (Though Australia is also a great example of how global cooperation on environmental issues can fix a huge problem, as they are the primary beneficiary of global action on closing the hole in the Ozone layer)

So solar power has been a great thing for Australia, especially with rooftop solar on Australian homes.

But it can lead to swingy electricity supply, given that solar only generates electricity when the sun is out.

How swings in solar supply and electricity pricing work

Most areas have certain times of day where more electricity is used than others. These are referred to as “peak hours” and generally they happen in the early evening, when people get home from work, turn on the HVAC, cook dinner, do laundry and the like.

But there are also certain times of day when more electricity is generated, and that’s particularly the case in places with high solar penetration. Solar obviously generates energy only during the day, and creates a peak of generation in the middle of the day, when most people are at work.

There are ways to mitigate this – for example, with batteries, which Australia has also used a lot of (and is thinking about extending that to EV batteries too). Wind power also helps, since wind tends to pick up in the hours that solar is dropping off.

But another way to mitigate it is through simple economics. Offer people lower prices in the hours that electricity is more abundant, and higher prices in hours where it isn’t. Then, people will tend to use electricity when they can – especially if they have shiftable loads like electric cars, laundry, pool pumps and such, which don’t need to be on at the same time every day (unlike HVAC, cooking, and lighting, for example).

Most electricity providers will offer something like this, called a “time of use” plan. These plans differ in their rates and peak hours depending on your location and how the supply/demand curves work for electricity there (and have seen common use among electric car owners because of the outsized effect an EV has on home electricity use).

On the utility side, though, the swings in price can be much more drastic. Wholesale prices for electricity can go up to multiple dollars per kilowatt-hour during times of extreme demand when the grid is stressed, and electricity prices can even go negative when there is little demand and lots of supply, particularly on an islanded grid like Australia (this also happens in Texas, where the grid is largely disconnected from the rest of the US). These swings are ironed out for the consumer, so things aren’t as spiky for us, but it can be quite a rollercoaster on the grid side.

In Australia and other places with high solar penetration, these negative electricity prices often happen during the day. That’s when generation is the highest for solar panels, and household loads are typically low.

Australia proposes letting everyone benefit from negative wholesale rates

So, the Australian government has decided on a scheme to bring those electricity savings to the consumer, with what its calling its “Solar Sharer” program.

The program would require electricity retailers to provide free electricity to everyone for at least three hours a day, in recognition of the incredibly low wholesale cost of electricity during daytime due to extensive solar power penetration.

These would likely be in the middle of the day, when most people aren’t home. However, every home has some amount of shiftable electricity load, and the Solar Sharer scheme would encourage people to make use of that. With modern appliances that can be scheduled to start in the middle of the day, people can just plan to do laundry, run the dishwasher, run the pool pump, or charge their car at noon, instead of whenever else they were going to.

Additionally, people could fill up a home battery during the day, and then use that electricity during peak hours when rates are higher. And this plan will help to incentivize private installation of batteries, or other shiftable loads.

The overall effect of this is that it will help to iron out electricity use, making it track more closely with electricity supply, reducing the need for grid upgrades to manage swings in generation. Just turning on this simple behavioral switch, and then publicizing it so customers know to use electricity in the free hours, will both help the grid and help ratepayers save money.

Better yet, this scheme will apply not just to people who have solar or home batteries, but to people who live in places where they can’t put up solar – those who live in apartments and the like. The government says it will require companies to offer this scheme to all customers, not just those with solar.

The government did receive some pushback from electricity retailers, who feel they were not properly consulted on the plan. But Australia’s Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said he would make “no apologies” if this scheme reduced their margins, and that “consumers are put first” as reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The government plans to implement the scheme starting in July next year, first in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. If it works well, other regions will get it starting in 2027.

Electrek’s Take

Australia is doing a lot of great things with electricity, and acting somewhat like a natural laboratory for a lot of ideas that people have been talking about for a long time. Since the whole country has similar solarization, it can work somewhat as a unit in pushing for solar power, and for reforms to help enable it.

It’s already working on V2G, with a huge trial started recently, and the wide adoption of solar and batteries is proving that even a solar-heavy grid can still work. And an idea like this, showing how simple economics can be used to change consumer behavior, could provide a model for the rest of the world on how to usher us into a cleaner energy future.

So we’ll be watching with interest how this turns out – I think it will likely turn out quite well, if the government goes through with it fully.

The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year. If you’ve ever considered going solar, now’s the time to act. To make sure you find a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage, a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar. It has hundreds of pre-vetted solar installers competing for your business, ensuring you get high-quality solutions and save 20-30% compared to going it alone. Plus, it’s free to use, and you won’t get sales calls until you select an installer and share your phone number with them.",https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/electrek.png?w=32,N,,2025-11-05 03:18:42.141350

AI Supercomputers to Power the Next Era of U.S. Innovation

On October 27, the DOE revealed plans for two new AMD-powered AI supercomputers — Lux and Discovery — at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The systems will expand U.S. capabilities in scientific computing, defense research, and next-generation energy innovation.

The Lux AI cluster, arriving in early 2026, will use AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs and EPYC CPUs to accelerate breakthroughs in nuclear fusion, quantum computing, and grid modernization. Meanwhile, Discovery — a record-setting HPE Cray system powered by next-generation AMD chips — will debut in 2028, promising performance that surpasses even Frontier, the world’s current second-largest supercomputer.

“Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that bring together the brightest minds in science and industry,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “With Lux and Discovery, America is proving we can build faster, lead stronger, and innovate smarter than anyone in the world.”

The DOE’s new public-private partnership model aims to cut the time required to deploy supercomputers from years to months by sharing costs and infrastructure with private firms.

NVIDIA, Oracle Join DOE for Nation’s Largest AI System

Just a day later, the DOE announced another groundbreaking alliance with NVIDIA and Oracle to build Solstice — the largest AI supercomputer in the Energy Department’s network — alongside a smaller system called Equinox, both housed at Argonne National Laboratory.

The Solstice system will feature 100,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, while Equinox will include 10,000, each designed to power scientific research from energy security to advanced materials discovery. Oracle will also provide immediate AI resources to DOE researchers, marking what officials called a “new commonsense model” for high-speed collaboration.

“AI is the most powerful technology of our time, and science is its greatest frontier,” said NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang. “Together, we’re building an AI factory that will serve as America’s engine for discovery.”

Trump Administration Invests $100 Million to Modernize Coal Plants

Capping off the week, the DOE issued a $100 million Notice of Funding Opportunity to refurbish and modernize the nation’s aging coal power plants — part of President Trump’s broader effort to restore energy independence and end what officials call the “war on coal.”

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal workers,” said Wright. “President Trump is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

The initiative will fund projects focused on improving power plant efficiency, enabling dual fuel capabilities between coal and natural gas, and developing advanced wastewater recovery systems. Managed by DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, applications are due January 7, 2026.

Role, BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent

4 hours ago

Stormont has been urged to back the creation of an independent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Northern Ireland.

Agriculture and Environment Minister Andrew Muir told members their cooperation was ""crucial"" and he was seeking ""an agreement in principle"" to get legislation in place by the end of this mandate.

But he warned that working in a power-sharing executive was ""hard"", and the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber was ""nothing more than a toxic thunderdome"" in terms of engagement.

The recommendation for an independent EPA came from a review of environmental governance.

Northern Ireland currently comes under the UK's environment watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection.

It has already carried out a number of investigations in Northern Ireland and published several reports.

But the assembly was told the lack of independent environmental oversight had led to ""substantial"" costs.

""The cost of remediation of the Mobuoy site could be between £100m and £700m,"" the minister said.

""The cost that we're spending this year in relation to the crisis at Lough Neagh as my department is over £17m and I could continue.

""So the business case of this is very clear.""

SDLP assembly member Daniel McCrossan questioned the pace of progress and asked when an independent agency would ""finally"" be established.

The minister replied that the environmental landscape was ""very different"" since the UK left the EU.

He added that co-operation of the assembly was ""absolutely crucial"" and he was determined to make progress.

The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs committee is due to consider the review group's report.

UUP assembly member Robbie Butler, who chairs the committee, welcomed the opportunity and said the terms of reference should ensure that the new body would not be a barrier to ""environmentally compliant and sustainable"" planning applications.

Funding concerns

During the debate, the minister acknowledged the constrained budget environment the Northern Ireland Assembly operates in.

DUP's Michelle McIlveen asked how he expected ""a new, additional body"" would be funded.

In response, Muir said the review recommended that the enabling legislation should guard against the risk of reduced funding.

Colm Gildernew from Sinn Féin sought reassurance that the new agency ""will have the teeth"" to address air quality issues that were causing concern in his Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency.

Thanking staff who currently work in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Muir said penalties available to the new agency would be set by the assembly.

""This is not a silver bullet,"" he added.

""Ultimately it requires political leadership here to ensure that there are sufficient deterrents in place so that the environmental agency as an independent non-departmental public body can use the proper enforcement mechanisms.""

RIN pricing has stabilized, but CFS credit prices continue to face headwinds, impacting segment profitability.

The heavy-duty trucking sector faces challenges such as uncertain policy regulations and low freight rates, affecting new truck sales.

The LCFS certification process is lengthy, potentially delaying full monetization of environmental credits.

The market environment for RNG adoption in heavy-duty trucking remains uncertain, with economic pressures affecting fleet decisions.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you provide an update on the RNG upstream business and expected production volumes?

A: Andrew Littlefair, President and CEO, stated that they currently have eight operating projects and expect to exit the year with 5 to 6 million gallons. They anticipate doubling this next year and reaching closer to 20 million gallons by 2027. The initial target of 100 million gallons was scaled back due to market conditions, but they are satisfied with their current position and focus on improving production rates.

Q: What is the status of the Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions and its impact on X15N adoption?

A: Andrew Littlefair mentioned that Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions has already engaged with 20 different fleets and has its first deal in the works. The partnership with Cummins and Hexagon Agility aims to lower barriers for fleets to adopt RNG-powered equipment, and they are optimistic about its potential to spur X15N adoption.

Q: How is the 15-litre engine ramping up in the market given current conditions?

A: Andrew Littlefair noted that the heavy-duty truck market faces challenges like freight rates and regulatory uncertainties, affecting new truck purchases. However, RNG offers a viable alternative with economic benefits, and major fleets like Walmart and Amazon have started adopting the X15N engine. They expect increased adoption as fleets experience its benefits.

Q: What are the capital expenditure requirements for the Maas Energy development projects?

A: Robert Vreeland, CFO, stated that the CapEx requirement for the three Maas Energy projects is about $35 million, with $12 million already contributed in the third quarter. The total plan involves about $85 million in investments.

Q: Can you discuss the recent flurry of supply agreements and their impact on volumes?

A: Andrew Littlefair explained that Clean Energy Fuels has hundreds of customers, and while not all agreements are announced, there is constant activity. The recent announcements reflect ongoing growth and renewals, with new transit and refuse customers contributing to the positive outlook.

Q: What is the timeline for certification of environmental attributes for new projects?

A: Andrew Littlefair indicated that certification for environmental attributes like RINs and LCFS credits takes time. The EPA is relatively quick, but full certification can take up to two years, as seen with their Del Rio project. They expect to fully monetize credits by 2026.

Q: How should we view the 2025 EBITDA guidance and potential upside?

A: Andrew Littlefair acknowledged that they are likely to be at the top end of their guidance range or slightly beyond, but they are not in a position to officially raise it at this time. They prefer not to micromanage quarterly guidance.

Q: What are the expectations for RNG volume growth in 2026?

A: Andrew Littlefair did not provide specific guidance for 2026 but indicated that they expect growth from their RNG production. The adoption rate for the X15N engine is uncertain, but they anticipate increased adoption as fleets become more familiar with the technology.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000PVT.png?5,N,,2025-11-05 03:18:46.908177

But while Budget 2025 has some important signals, there is still work to be done to ensure Canada will reap the broader economic benefits of the energy transition and that Canadians will stand to benefit.
The budget also maintains and expands effective supports for the clean economy, like the existing clean technology investment and manufacturing tax credits, while confirming plans to finalize the new Clean Electricity tax credit.
“Also missing are concrete nationbuilding efforts to build out the clean electricity supply needed to meet the demands of the future.
Similarly, any new conditions introduced to the Clean Electricity and Clean Technology investment tax credits must help accelerate the build-out of our electricity system, not hinder it.","OTTAWA — Rachel Doran, executive director of Clean Energy Canada, made the following statement in response to the federal government’s Budget 2025.

“Today’s much-anticipated budget was billed as setting a clear, consequential direction for Canada. But while Budget 2025 has some important signals, there is still work to be done to ensure Canada will reap the broader economic benefits of the energy transition and that Canadians will stand to benefit.

“In what was billed as a competitiveness budget, it is clear that the government recognizes the importance of low-carbon industries and the clean economy to drive Canada’s economic future and ensure continued access to international markets. At a high level, the climate competitiveness strategy rightly focuses on offering regulatory certainty, crowding in private capital, and incentivizing clean technologies, alongside a key promise to develop new metrics to track success.

“To that end, it’s helpful to have regulatory certainty around important policies that are driving down emissions while equipping Canada and Canadian industries for the future, like the commitment to not only keep but strengthen industrial carbon pricing alongside plans to maintain the Clean Electricity Regulations with the possibility of negotiated agreements with provinces. The budget also maintains and expands effective supports for the clean economy, like the existing clean technology investment and manufacturing tax credits, while confirming plans to finalize the new Clean Electricity tax credit.

“A big focus on critical minerals is one particularly exciting part of this budget, with the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund helping to derisk investments and ensure supply is available for strategic industries. Critical minerals are the lifeblood of clean technologies and of realizing stronger energy security for Canada, not only through the adoption of those technologies but also by giving Canada leverage with its international trade partners.

“However, absent today is a focus on the benefits for individual Canadians and households in the energy transition. The ending of the Greener Homes Grant and Loan, combined with uncertainty around the EV Availability Standard and no recapitalization of the federal EV rebate program, will make life less affordable for many Canadians whose monthly energy bills remain tethered to fossil fuel prices set outside of Canada. Without these programs, it is critical for the sake of consumer affordability that Canada improves market conditions through competition, namely by keeping in place an effective EV Availability Standard, lowering the tariff on Chinese EVs, and easing the way for more European EVs.

“Also missing are concrete nationbuilding efforts to build out the clean electricity supply needed to meet the demands of the future. While tax credit finalization is important in what has been called the “Age of Electricity,” a more ambitious focus on clean electricity projects, including renewables, transmission, and energy efficiency needs to be at the centre of Canada’s industrial strategy. Similarly, any new conditions introduced to the Clean Electricity and Clean Technology investment tax credits must help accelerate the build-out of our electricity system, not hinder it.

“Much remains to be seen in the details. There will still be work to ensure changes to industrial pricing are strengthened, that agreements with provinces on clean electricity are robust, that the EV Availability Standard is maintained at a consumer-benefiting level, and that the new framework proposed to regulate oil and gas emissions will be effective.

“Major new investments in infrastructure, housing, and defence offer a real opportunity to create the markets and expectations for clean industrial products and processes in Canada, but work remains around implementation to turn this possibility into a reality. While there is mention of lowering emissions by 20% in construction, it’s disheartening to see a lack of clarity and specificity, especially given that effective policies like Buy Clean could be leveraged to achieve this goal and provide a clear market signal to Canadian producers. New investments in training and reskilling should also aim to set Canadian workers up with job security for the long term by focusing on the industries and skill sets of the future.

“So, is Budget 2025 a shift in the right direction? Or as Prime Minister Mark Carney put it today, does it help Canada take control of its future? To a degree, but there are important missing pieces.

“Thankfully, it is not the only critical decision point before this government, and we look forward to more announcements for projects of national significance, a hopefully productive update to the EV Availability Standard, and a meeting of provincial ministers later this month to discuss overcoming internal barriers in the way of realizing a more united Canadian economy.

“When the prime minister talks about Canada writing its own future, we should ensure such a future includes an economy that both meets this moment and tangibly benefits the everyday Canadians who not only work but live in that economy.”",https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kat-FbiqTljojKY-unsplash-scaled-e1762295607126.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 05:18:06.464784

""The American auto industry frankly is in limbo, whether they're going to be able to continue to be competitive in the global market and even here at home,"" said Jesse Lee, a senior advisor at Climate Power.

The elimination of the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing EVs under the Trump administration's policies was cited as a setback for production.

Lee warned, ""If this doesn't get kind of turned around by Congress before Trump leaves office, you know in the next three years, you know you're gonna be looking at a place where it may never be possible to catch up.""

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reinstated the $7,500 tax credit, but it ended in September.

Marick Masters, a professor of business emeritus at Wayne State University, noted the challenges for companies to invest in EVs without policy incentives and mandates. ""You've got to capture international markets and we're far behind the curve with China,"" Masters said, highlighting the competitive disadvantage.

While the Antarctic ozone hole is healing due to global efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances, there is still plenty of work to be done.

The Shorthorn Editorial Board believes that students and lawmakers should be more environmentally aware. People should acknowledge, advocate and vote for policies that work toward addressing climate change issues.

As the planet gets warmer, communities are having to deal with the repercussions.

The Central Texas floods on the Fourth of July was one of the deadliest flood events in American history, recording more than 100 people dead, according to Yale Climate Connections, a nonpartisan news service from Yale University.

The natural disaster started hundreds of miles to the southeast in the Gulf of Mexico. The body of water has gotten several degrees Fahrenheit hotter due to climate change, turning into a puddle of fuel for hurricanes barreling toward the Gulf Coast, according to the news service.

These increasingly severe weather events are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a warming planet.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) significantly reduced National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff, research capacity and data-sharing capabilities, including weather forecasts, according to the Center for American Progress.

The consequences of such policy decisions become clear when looking at how communities struggle to prepare for, respond to and are affected by disasters.

Intensifying weather conditions continue to affect Texas. The seasonal temperature outlook for December through February 2026 predicts that Texas weather will likely be above normal seasonal temperature, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s seasonal temperature outlook.

Although fewer counties have experienced level D4, or exceptional drought, across Texas compared to October 2024, much of the state is sitting at D0, or abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, created by the National Drought Mitigation Center and other agencies.

Some of the historically observed impacts under a D0 category nclude grass fires increasing, surface water levels declining, planting being postponed and producers starting supplemental feeding for livestock, according to the monitor.

At the same time, extreme weather beyond the United States is also growing in intensity.

On Oct. 28, Hurricane Melissa, a catastrophic Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica and became one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.

The hurricane killed 28 people in Jamaica, at least 31 in Haiti and at least two in the Dominican Republic, according to BBC News. Thousands of people were also evacuated, and more than 60,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Cuba.

These global and regional climate patterns serve as a stark reminder that the consequences of insufficient climate action are far-reaching and immediate.

In the aftermath of a 2017 river flooding in Texas’ Hill Country, officials in Kerr County considered supplementing the local word-of-mouth system with sirens and river gauges, along with other modern communication tools, according to The New York Times.

In May, county commissioners discussed a flood warning system being developed by a regional agency as something they might be able to use, according to The New York Times.

The change did not happen. There were no sirens and no early flooding monitors. Instead, there were only text alerts from the National Weather Service that came too late for some residents and were dismissed by others.

Rob Kelly, Kerr County judge, said in an interview with The New York Times that the county did not have a warning system because it was expensive and residents were resistant to new spending. This resistance highlights how policy priorities shaped by both elected officials and voters can have life-or-death consequences in the face of climate-related disasters.

Without proper warning systems, residents rely on those same word-of-mouth systems that may only help those nearby. As storms and floods intensify, the cost of inaction grows heavier. The need for informed, proactive participation in shaping environmental policy has never been more critical.

These local challenges mirror a broader national issue. Decreased funding and staffing at various weather services further emphasizes the importance of public awareness and civic engagement. Understanding how dangerous climate change is and its effect on natural disasters is crucial in helping communities prepare and respond more effectively.

Preparedness requires more than individual awareness: It demands collective civic action through advocacy and voting for policies that strengthen climate resilience and protect vulnerable communities.

The next flood, fire or drought won’t wait for hesitation. Residents should push for leadership that recognizes the realities of climate change.

(AKRON, Ohio – November 4, 2025) – Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (""B&W"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: BW) announced it plans to leverage its reliable, readily available and proven natural gas technologies to help meet the growing power demands of artificial intelligence data centers, as it works to capitalize on a more than $3 billion pipeline of opportunities in this expanding market. In alignment with this strategy the Company has announced it has signed a limited notice to proceed with Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) to begin work for the delivery and installation of natural gas technology that will provide one gigawatt of efficient energy for an AI Data Center project. Full release for the estimated $1.5 billion contract is expected in the first quarter of 2026.

“This initial project with Applied Digital represents an exciting and transformational opportunity to broaden B&W’s customer base as the Company expands into the rapidly evolving AI Data Center space,” said Kenneth Young, B&W Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The impact from this deal on B&W is profound, adding over $3 billion to our pipeline which brings our total global pipeline to over $10 billion. It also marks a natural next step for our Company, which has been a global leader in designing and deploying reliable and efficient steam generation systems for nearly 160 years. Our customers know they can count on us to deliver robust energy solutions that provide them with dependable, available and long-term power for their operations. These aspects make our technology offerings highly compelling for customers and differentiates us from other energy source options in today’s market.”

""For the third quarter, we delivered strong operating results while displaying continued core business momentum and significant margin improvement,"" Young said. “Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Income significantly outperformed Company and consensus expectations this quarter. Our growing backlog, which was 56% higher compared to the same period last year, benefited from increasing demand across Thermal projects, upgrades and construction, as baseload generation needs in North America continue to accelerate. Our core parts, services and construction businesses continued to excel in the third quarter, and we anticipate further seasonal strength through the fourth quarter of 2025 with tailwinds from rising global energy needs fueling demand for our offerings. During the third quarter, our Global Parts & Services achieved the highest quarterly and year-to-date bookings, revenue, gross profit and EBITDA in recent company history. In addition, we paid down over $70 million of bonds due February 2026, and plan to continue to buy back remaining bonds in December as announced today.""

""We believe B&W is in a unique position to capitalize on the growing demand for baseload generation in North America and across the world. The increasing need for power and electricity fueled by demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and expanding economies are key drivers for growth across our broad range of technologies. Based on this momentum, we anticipate 2026 Adjusted EBITDA from our core business in the range of $70 million to $85 million, showing significant sequential growth over 2025. This range does not include any AI Data Center projects, which, when contracted, would serve as upside to this forecast. B&W’s recent data center project with Applied Digital demonstrates the core strengths of our Company, including our ability to provide reliable and efficient power generation solutions to our customers, and our extensive engineering, construction and project management experience. We remain optimistic about the significant upside across our business through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026 due to expected increases in parts and services revenue, as well as known data center projects in our pipeline. We believe this extended demand for our technology and services continues to position us for sustained success and provides B&W with a strong outlook moving forward.""

“This quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of Diamond Power International for gross proceeds of $177 million and we just completed the sale of Allen-Sherman-Hoff (ASH) for gross proceeds of $29 million. Both of these sales further improve our balance sheet and reinforce the value of our underlying assets as we re-capitalize our businesses going forward,"" Young added. ""The proceeds of the Diamond and ASH sales allow us to continue to pay down our existing debt obligations. We remain intently focused on our strategic vision and continue to explore the sale of other non-strategic assets, as well as potential refinancing options to reduce our current and long-term debt obligations. Additionally, during the quarter we entered a strategic partnership with Denham Capital to help convert existing coal plants to natural gas to power data centers in the U.S. and Europe. Through this partnership, B&W will work to convert coal plants to cleaner energy solutions, such as natural gas, while scaling electrical generation capacity for further AI and data center growth. This leaves B&W well-positioned to support the power demand from data centers and global AI growth now and in the future.”

""We are seeing strong global demand for our diverse portfolio of technologies and as a result of recent data center opportunities, our global pipeline has increased to over $10.0 billion. We continue to make progress on converting this pipeline of identified project opportunities into bookings, as displayed by our strong base business and backlog results this quarter. We expect industry tailwinds and generation demand to continue to increase in the coming years, and we believe these tailwinds, coupled with our higher margins and improved cash flows, provide a strong foundation for B&W to grow in the remainder of 2025 and beyond.""

Q3 2025 Continuing Operations Financial Summary

Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $149.0 million versus revenues of $152.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. This change is primarily driven by lower large project volume of $20.6 million, larger projects being completed last year as well as the timing of anticipated bookings slipping later into 2025. Global Parts & Service revenue in the third quarter of 2025 was $68.4 million compared to revenue of $61.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. This improvement is primarily due to the increasing need for electricity from fossil fuels driven by the demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and expanding economies. Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $6.5 million, compared to operating income of $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase is primarily driven by reduced corporate overhead costs. Loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $2.3 million, compared to a loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven by the improvement in the operating income results noted above. Loss per common share in the third quarter of 2025 was $0.06 compared to a loss per common share of $0.13 in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 million, an increase compared to $8.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. Reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's segments, are provided in the exhibits to this release.

Liquidity and Balance Sheet

At September 30, 2025, the Company had total debt of $416.4 million and a cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $201.1 million. B&W paid down $70 million of bonds due February 2026 on October 2, 2025, and expects remaining outstanding February 2026 bonds to be paid down fully in December 2025.

Earnings Call Information

B&W plans to host a conference call and webcast on Monday, November 10, 2025 at 5 p.m. ET to discuss the Company's third quarter 2025 results. The listen-only audio of the conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet on B&W’s Investor Relations site. The dial-in number for participants in the U.S. is (833) 470-1428; the dial-in number for participants in Canada is (833) 950-0062; the dial-in number for participants in all other locations is (929) 526-1599. The conference ID for all participants is 013844. A replay of this conference call will remain accessible in the investor relations section of the Company’s website for a limited time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally, also referred to in this release as “adjusted” financial measures, to evaluate its performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, the Company believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting its financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each of the segments, further adjusted for corporate allocations and research and development costs. At a segment level, the Adjusted EBITDA presented is consistent with the way the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business and is calculated as earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization adjusted for items such as gains or losses arising from the sale of non-income producing assets, net pension benefits, restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, costs related to financial consulting, and other costs that may not be directly controllable by segment management and are not allocated to the segment. The Company presents consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the ongoing, operating performance before corporate overhead and other expenses not attributable to the operating performance of the Company's revenue generating segments. In addition, the Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because of the increasing importance of BrightLoop and ClimateBright to the future growth of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright to assess the Company's performance independent of these technologies.

This release also presents certain targets for the Company's Adjusted EBITDA in the future; these targets are not intended as guidance regarding how the Company believes the business will perform. The Company is unable to reconcile these targets to their GAAP counterparts without unreasonable effort and expense. Prior period results have been revised to conform with the revised definition and present separate reconciling items in our reconciliation, including business transition costs.

Bookings and Backlog

Bookings and backlog are our measure of remaining performance obligations under our sales contracts. It is possible that our methodology for determining bookings and backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Implied backlog and implied bookings include projects awarded or under contract but not fully released for performance.

We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customers to payment for work performed. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and contracts in our backlog may be canceled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. Backlog can vary significantly from period to period, particularly when large new build projects or operations and maintenance contracts are booked because they may be fulfilled over multiple years. Because we operate globally, our backlog is also affected by changes in foreign currencies each period. We do not include orders of our unconsolidated joint ventures in backlog.

Bookings represent changes to the backlog. Bookings include additions from booking new business, subtractions from customer cancellations or modifications, changes in estimates of liquidated damages that affect selling price and revaluation of backlog denominated in foreign currency. We believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods, and that shorter-term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend.

Pipeline

Pipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue, which has a reasonable likelihood of contract execution. Pipeline is an internal metric monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue.

We cannot guarantee that our pipeline will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.

Impacts of Market Conditions

Management continues to adapt to macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts from inflation, changing interest rates and foreign exchange rate volatility, current and potential tariff actions and geopolitical conflicts and global shipping and supply chain disruptions that continued to have an impact during the first nine months of 2025. In certain instances, these situations have resulted in cost increases and delays or disruptions that have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our ability to meet customers’ demands. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these market conditions on current and future periods and actively manage costs and our liquidity position to provide additional flexibility while still supporting our customers and their specific needs. The duration and scope of these conditions cannot be predicted, and therefore, any anticipated negative financial impact on our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated.

But the electric vehicle maker’s stock surge couldn’t mask the harsh reality waiting just beyond the quarterly numbers: October EV sales plummeted 43% compared to the same month last year, according to automotive consultancy Urban Science, as the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits triggers the demand collapse EVXL predicted.

The Irvine-based company reported an adjusted loss of 65 cents per share for the quarter ending September 30, beating Wall Street’s expectation of a 71-cent loss, according to Bloomberg. Revenue hit $1.56 billion, topping the $1.5 billion estimate. But the actual reported loss told a different story: 96 cents per share, worse than the 88-cent loss analysts anticipated, Barron’s reported.

Positive Gross Profit Masks Temporary Tax Credit Surge

Rivian achieved $24 million in positive gross profit during Q3, significantly better than the $64 million loss Wall Street expected, according to CNBC. The company slashed automotive costs by nearly $19,000 per vehicle year-over-year, demonstrating progress on CEO RJ Scaringe’s aggressive cost-reduction program.

The improved numbers were driven largely by a 32% surge in deliveries to 13,201 vehicles compared to the same quarter last year. But that spike wasn’t organic growth—it was customers rushing to purchase before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025.

“Higher third-quarter EV deliveries helped boost revenue 78% from a year earlier to about $1.56 billion, topping Wall Street estimates,” Bloomberg reported. “The company sold more than 13,000 EVs in the period, helped by consumers rushing to secure the $7,500 US tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30.”

Rivian’s stock rose 3.4% in after-hours trading following the earnings release, with shares climbing to $13 despite declining less than 1% through Monday’s close for the year.

R2 Launch On Track As Tariff Impacts Ease

Scaringe emphasized progress on the company’s make-or-break R2 midsize SUV, scheduled for first-half 2026 deliveries at a targeted starting price of $45,000.

“R2 delivers on the adventurous spirit customers expect from Rivian,” Scaringe said in the shareholder letter. “It’s also a great daily driver that will fit so many different use cases for our customers.”

The company said it’s on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026 and will launch with “features and a price to make the most people the most happy,” Scaringe told analysts on an earnings call, according to Bloomberg.

Rivian also disclosed reduced tariff impacts following policy changes. The company now expects tariff costs of “hundreds of dollars” per vehicle, down from the “couple thousand dollar hit it saw per car in the third quarter,” CNBC reported. Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough attributed the improvement to expanded offset policies for certain imported parts on American-made vehicles.

October Sales Collapse Reveals Post-Credit Reality

The optimistic Q3 numbers stand in stark contrast to October’s performance. Consumer EV purchases dropped 43% compared to October 2024, according to data from automotive consultancy Urban Science cited in Bloomberg’s original reporting.

The timing directly follows the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used models. Congress eliminated the incentive through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” cutting short a program originally scheduled to run through 2032.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs, and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” Scaringe wrote in the shareholder letter, according to Rivian’s official release.

Rivian previously lowered its 2025 delivery guidance to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, down from an earlier target of 46,000 units. Fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to drop approximately 30% year-over-year, with the company projecting around 10,000 vehicles for the period.

Mind Robotics Spinoff Raises $110 Million

In an unexpected announcement buried in the earnings release, Rivian revealed it established a new company called Mind Robotics in November 2025, securing approximately $110 million in external seed capital led by venture capital firm Eclipse, TechCrunch reported.

The industrial AI and robotics venture will focus on “the advancement of industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the shareholder letter. Scaringe will serve as chairman of Mind Robotics’ board of directors.

The launch marks Rivian’s second major spinoff in 2025, following the March creation of ALSO Inc., a micromobility company that develops electric bikes and quadricycles.

EVXL’s Take

Let’s be clear about what just happened: Wall Street applauded Rivian’s Q3 “beat” while completely ignoring that those deliveries were artificially inflated by customers racing to claim tax credits before they vanished. Now that temporary surge has evaporated, and October’s 43% sales collapse reveals the brutal reality facing every EV maker in the post-subsidy era.

We’ve been tracking this exact scenario for months. Back in July, we covered the impending tax credit expiration and warned about the demand cliff that would follow. In October, we reported on Rivian’s third round of layoffs in four months—600 jobs cut, primarily in sales, marketing, and customer service. The same day, Rivian announced a $250 million settlement of an IPO fraud lawsuit alleging the company deliberately concealed pricing problems during its 2021 public offering.

Here’s the disconnect that should worry investors: Rivian is cutting the very teams it needs most to launch the R2 successfully. As we noted in our analysis of CEO RJ Scaringe’s layoff memo, the company is slashing sales and marketing staff right when it needs massive consumer education and aggressive outreach to move beyond early adopters. The R2 launch will determine whether Rivian survives or joins the graveyard of EV startups that couldn’t scale.

The positive gross profit deserves credit—it shows Rivian can theoretically build vehicles profitably. But “theoretically” doesn’t pay the bills when you’re burning over $1 billion per quarter and sitting on less than $6 billion in remaining cash. The $110 million Mind Robotics spinoff, while potentially valuable long-term, feels like rearranging deck chairs when the ship needs all hands focused on the R2 launch.

Context matters here. GM just laid off 3,300 EV workers following the tax credit expiration, idling massive battery plants barely two months after the subsidy ended. Ford’s October EV sales dropped 25% year-over-year. Toyota sold just 18 units of its BZ electric vehicle in October, down from 1,401 a year earlier. This isn’t a Rivian problem—it’s an industry-wide reckoning.

The R2 represents Rivian’s last chance to prove it can compete in the mass market. Starting at $45,000 without any federal incentives, it needs to be compelling enough to convince mainstream buyers to choose electric over comparable gas SUVs that cost $10,000 less. Analysts estimate automakers need around 400,000 annual sales to achieve positive operating income—a target that remains distant even if the R2 succeeds.

Wall Street may be celebrating cost cuts and improved margins, but the real test arrives in early 2026 when the R2 hits the market. Will Rivian’s adventure-focused brand resonate with budget-conscious families? Can a company that just gutted its sales force effectively market to mass-market buyers? And most critically: will there be enough “natural demand” for EVs without subsidies to support a pure-play electric vehicle company?

We’ll find out soon enough. Either Rivian establishes itself as a legitimate Tesla alternative, or 2026 becomes the year it joins Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and other cautionary tales about the brutal economics of EV manufacturing.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.
We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.
Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.
To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.","Check against delivery

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada’s prosperity for decades are being reshaped – threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound—hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

“Let’s accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.”

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation’s future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them – to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home – stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren’t receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the ‘trickle down’ ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada’s future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country’s future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund – allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition — from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

“Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.’’

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

“Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.”

That recognition matters – because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That’s the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That’s why this budget charts a new course for Canada’s public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada’s future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada’s new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government’s Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity –doing more with less – because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada’s position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy – starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what’s necessary – and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan –the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada’s productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities – they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation – ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada’s North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we’ll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods – this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres – this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Bécancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers — a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That’s the way to go!

That’s what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called “Minister of Everything” at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians – and neither are we.

This budget is guided by the conviction that Canada must remain a nation of builders – of infrastructure and innovation, of trust in public institutions, and of hope for generations to come.

This nation knows how to build:

We built the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, allowing our country to be connected from coast to coast and supporting trade across the Prairies;

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world’s top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada’s next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings — a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It’s about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That’s what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We’ve launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I’m sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada’s defence industry – strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure – like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home – creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada’s strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada’s reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it’s about working smarter.

It’s about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada’s productivity has been lagging – a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing – turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development – and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada’s debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels – allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada’s natural wealth – critical minerals, clean power – into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits – measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada’s economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, “these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada’s economic strategy”.

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation – a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision – one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people’s pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians – to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it’s about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It’s about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let’s rise to this generational challenge.

Let’s build Canada strong.

Because we are – and always will be – the true North, strong and free.

LONG LIVE CANADA!",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-05 05:18:10.329554

There are the obvious ones, the natural consequences of living adjacent to this abundant resource that so many notorious players seek to take advantage of — the environmental devastation posed by the Line 5 pipeline running underneath the Straits of Mackinac and the commodification of water by companies like Nestle circumventing the Great Lakes Compact, for example. But then there are the other problems — the obscured shortcuts and mistakes that are more indicative of the tenuous relationship between politicians and their constituents, between those with power and those without it. Infamously, we’ve seen this with the Flint Water Crisis over the past decade, where a switch in city water supply initially exposed more than 100,000 people to contaminated water and led to criminal charges being pressed against negligent state officials (but these were eventually dropped). Recently, though, tensions pertaining to water infrastructure and access are bubbling to the surface a little bit closer to home.

In Detroit, water justice is a pressing issue, but a neglected one. Residents across the city are experiencing perpetual flooding cycles that are directly connected to city water infrastructure, and tens of thousands are regularly unable to afford water services to their homes at all. It’s a complicated web, one in which the term “water crisis” doesn’t fully do justice to the variety of calamities unfolding. Despite this, a consistent through line remains: The city’s response and non-local media coverage have been lacking, keeping the crisis shrouded in an air of secrecy and away from sustainable avenues for change that truly address its root causes.

***

Over the past decade, access to safe and affordable water has increasingly become a luxury in Detroit. In 2014, one year after the City of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the Detroit Water and Sewage Department shut off water services for more than 20,000 Detroit residents with unpaid water bills in an effort to pay off their own debts. Between 2014 and 2020, more than 141,000 Detroit residences had their water shut off at some point — a little more than 20% of the city’s current population. Shut-offs were paused for more than three years during the pandemic — a combination of a moratorium issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the City of Detroit’s extension — but in August 2023, the shut-off campaign resumed. The impact has been enormous, predominantly for low-income residents, leaving tens of thousands of households suddenly on the hook for $700 to $10,000 in water debt they cannot pay off, and with no access to running water in the meantime — a human rights violation, according to the United Nations.

In an email with The Michigan Daily, Monica Lewis-Patrick, We the People of Detroit CEO and president, contextualized the rationale driving these mass shutoff campaigns.

“Shutoffs have been used by water systems as a tool to manage debt rather than to support residents’ needs,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “These decisions have been driven by financial pressures tied to bond obligations, state oversight and austerity politics, which prioritize revenue collection over basic human needs. It’s deeply unjust that Detroiters, largely Black and low-income residents, are targeted to absorb the system’s financial strain while external customers are not paying their fair share.”

In addition to the increased financial pressures and practical consequences associated with one’s water being turned off, Lewis-Patrick emphasized the negative physical and emotional health impacts created by water shutoffs.

“A study by researchers at the Henry Ford Global Health Initiative found that residents living on blocks where water shutoffs occurred were 1.55 times more likely to be diagnosed with a water-associated illness,” Lewis-Patrick wrote.

All of this is coming at a time when water is becoming increasingly unaffordable for the average household. Across the United States, water bills are rising about 7% every year, and Detroit is not exempt from this pattern. The Great Lakes Water Authority placed a 10-year 4% cap on water rate increases, but this expired in June 2025, prompting a 7.73% proposed hike in Metro Detroit water rates for 2026. In relation to its suburbs, the city of Detroit is disproportionately feeling the impacts of this due to the 1999 Rate Settlement Agreement dubbed the “83/17 split,” which burdens Detroit residents with paying 83% of regional stormwater treatment infrastructure costs while its suburbs (with a 2021 median household income more than twice that of Detroit’s) only pay a collective 17%. With 34% of Detroit residents living below the poverty line, these inflated water bills are proving increasingly difficult to pay. In 2022, DWSD implemented the water affordability Lifeline Plan in an attempt to address these issues, but the funding has since mostly dried up, raising questions about the program’s efficacy moving forward.

“The underlying problem isn’t just the loss of one program,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “It’s the absence of a long-term, water affordability plan that ensures every household can maintain access regardless of income.”

The water issues plaguing Detroit aren’t limited to increasing rates and water shutoffs, too; there are also significant problems with the city’s water infrastructure that are directly impacting Detroit residents and going unaddressed. On July 19, 2024, a water main broke in northwest Detroit, near the corner of Biltmore and Gilchrist streets, flooding the basements of nearby residents like Diana Hill, Sabrina Moore and Tina Wixon, and causing thousands of dollars in damages.

“I’m still struggling to pay off the debt for all of the damages, and I still need stuff fixed,” Wixon said in an interview with The Daily.

All three described severe damageafter water seeped into their homes for more than 12 hours. The flood and its aftermath ruined appliances, destroyed family keepsakes and left black mold covering the floor.

“I had to replace my heating system because it was inoperable,” Moore said. “That furnace cost $9,000.”

Beyond the damage to their physical possessions, these women and their families have been experiencing different health issues since the floods began, citing asthma and other respiratory issues that have been exacerbated by the black mold in their homes. Part of the reason for concern is the water itself, Moore adds, describing how she has to run the water coming from her bathroom sink before using it because of how it smells.

“I’m starting to question that the water system is even safe for us to be consuming,” Moore said. “I believe our water is contaminated. Our water needs to be checked by an independent source.”

In response, the city and the DWSD have been unhelpful.

“The (DWSD) still refuses to give us any compensation. They refused to even help us,” Hill said. “I had to call the Red Cross, I called (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and each one of them told me it wasn’t a disaster so they couldn’t help me. So I had to lose my emergency money.”

These three women were introduced to me by Beulah Walker, vice chief director of Hydrate Detroit, a Detroit-based water relief organization. And as the five of us met over Zoom to talk about the flooding, Walker described how July 19, 2024 is only one instance in a bigger pattern of Band-Aid solutions and neglect.

“This flooding has been going on for 10 years, ever since the bankruptcy,” Walker said. Hill nodded, elaborating to say that it’s happening all across the city, but “not every area is getting the same treatment.”

According to Hill, the claims the women filed were denied on the basis of the Michigan Governmental Liability for Negligence Act of 1964. Section 17 of this act makes the government not liable for damages resulting from the overflow of a sewage disposal system. But that’s not what happened on Gilchrist Street, Hill argues — it’s fresh water that they’ve seen filling up their basements.

“The interpretation of the rules — what (Hill) is reading — we might see it one way, but they have already interpreted it a whole different way,” Moore said. “We need to understand what is the verbiage really saying. We’re tired of people just lying to us.”

Frustration with the lack of institutional powers listening to what’s going on is a common theme across each of these three women’s experiences.

“We live here in this beautiful city of Detroit, raise our families, we are homeowners, we pay taxes. We should never have to deal with flooding in our homes due to a lack of services that are supposed to keep our city water system safe,” Moore said. “To me, it shows there’s a lack of respect for people — for human rights.”

At the end of our conversation, Hill, who is now in her 70s, tells me that she used to work for the University of Michigan — first in housekeeping and then in a lab on North Campus.

“These people have occupations,” Walker said, jumping in to add that Moore works in health care and Wixon works in quality control. “You know, when people are reading these stories, they go, ‘Oh these people don’t do nothing but just sit at home.’ You know how people think about Detroit residents: that we’re just lazy and don’t do shit.”

Hill, Moore and Wixon’s resilience in the face of these challenges, alongside the tenacious work of local water rights advocacy groups like Hydrate Detroit and We the People of Detroit, couldn’t be clearer in refuting the stereotypes Walker references. There is an abundance of grassroots movements taking shape in Detroit right now, from the informal neighborhood collective of Gilchrist Street to formal institutions taking a statewide approach like the People’s Water Board Coalition. The fight is far from over.

“We’re not giving up,” Moore said.

Like any good Michigander, I could talk at length about what’s happening in Flint or the evils posed to the Great Lakes by Nestle, but can I let you in on a secret? Even though I grew up in Royal Oak, a suburb about three miles north of Detroit, I had no idea of the extent to which Detroiters were facing similar water issues. The state of various water crises in Detroit was introduced to me for the first time only a few weeks ago when We the People of Detroit came to present in my Sociology 225 class. Hearing about the 83/17 split, I felt ashamed for not having paid closer attention to the structural injustices embedded in the communities around me. Now, though, the shock factor has worn off, and I’m angry. Tens of thousands of Detroit residents are regularly experiencing the effects of water injustice, whether it’s with uncompensated flooding damages as the result of poorly maintained DWSD infrastructure or water services being shut off to their home. This should not be a secret. Why aren’t more people talking about this?

What’s happening with water in Detroit is the type of crisis that should be making national headlines, but it’s not. Whether water should be commodified or considered a human right is a major topic of conversation across the U.S. and the world, but Detroit, with its majority-Black population, largely seems to be excluded from these dialogues. The city’s complicated web of water issues is being diligently covered by Metro Detroit news outlets such as the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Detroit, but by and large, the crisis is not getting the attention it deserves.

“It’s striking how many people still don’t know about the water crisis in Detroit, despite its inextricable connection to Flint and the broader fight for water justice,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “Too often, crises that predominantly impact Black and Brown people are underreported or framed as management failures instead of systemic injustices rooted in policy and disinvestment.”

In Flint — another city with a majority-Black population and a severe water crisis — national media coverage has slipped significantly despite lingering contaminated water and distrust towards the city’s institutions persisting even 10 years after the water supply was initially switched. Flint’s water crisis was quickly catapulted from a local story to an international one in early 2016 when a state of emergency was declared, but has since slipped back into being an exclusively local story, even though the crisis is far from over — public trust is damaged, physical and mental health issues are prevalent and residents still haven’t seen any money from the $626.25 million settlement fund (though checks are promised in November). This begs the question in Flint, Detroit and beyond: What does it take for people to keep their eyes on a crisis long enough to see its resolution through?

It’s easy to look at data chronicling Detroit’s recent population growth and the success of the city’s sports teams and agree with the flashy national headlines that argue for Detroit’s rebound: “Detroit is Cool Again,” a National Geographic article reads. I’m hesitant to fully follow this line of thinking, though, because, first of all, it implies a time when Detroit wasn’t a cultural hub. But, more importantly, proclamations that “Detroit’s so back,” seem to neglect the experiences of so many of the city’s residents who are still suffering the consequences of the bankruptcy and struggling to access clean and affordable water. We shouldn’t let these on-the-ground realities become secrets, obscured by powerful people incentivized to maintain a facade of an upward trend experienced equally across the city. If you’re reading this in Ann Arbor, thinking that living an hour west of Detroit makes you removed from the city’s problems, I can promise you that it does not. The way the University prides itself on being “Leaders and the Best” sometimes facilitates an elitist sense of disconnect from the communities around it, as if U-M students are meant to remain posed in this ivory tower, looking down at these experiences of inequality beneath us. In reality, the University alone does not represent all of the “best” the state of Michigan has to offer, but it is an integral player, just like Detroit is. It is our responsibility to be using the power of the University’s resources and, equally as important, the power of our attention, to engage with the state of Michigan community in meaningful ways — and most immediately, to give the Detroit Water Crisis the spotlight it deserves.

Funding would be divided into two categories: water supply projects, and other existing water programs.
Water supply projects would expand the overall volume of water available in Texas.
The Texas Water Foundation said that the proposition prohibits the use of the New Water Supply Fund for the transfer of groundwater.
Disclosure: Texas Water Foundation has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

Texas is poised to make the largest investment in its water supply in the state’s 180-year history after voters on Tuesday approved Proposition 4, which authorizes $20 billion to be spent on water projects over the next two decades.

The vote comes at a time when communities are scrambling to find new water supplies to meet the needs of their growing population, all the while deteriorating infrastructure, and a warming climate threatens the state’s water supply.

Throughout Texas’ history, ensuring water supply has rarely been a partisan issue. Many see it as a precious resource essential to both survival and the prosperity of the state’s economy. However, this year proved that water is personal and deeply emotional too. Proposed reservoirs and groundwater exports in East Texas have outraged many in the water-rich region, desalination projects along the Coastal Bend region have sparked political debate amid a water crisis, and data centers expanding across arid West Texas have locals worried about their dwindling groundwater supply.

These challenges and others pushed lawmakers to make big investments in water at the Capitol this year.

“Prop 4 is the culmination of almost 30 years of bipartisan work to create reliable and predictable funding for Texas water,” said Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of Texas Water Foundation, a nonprofit that educates Texans on water issues.

“We are thrilled that Texans showed up, asked deep questions, and that they chose to prioritize water infrastructure needs across the state. That tells you a lot about the state of Texas water.”

A portion of existing state sales tax revenue — up to $1 billion annually — would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year, starting in 2027 to help fund water, wastewater and flood infrastructure projects.

The funding comes from existing revenue, meaning no new taxes would be created. However, the money would only be transferred to the fund when sales tax collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. The past two fiscal years have surpassed that amount. Assuming the state’s growth continues, there will be enough money available to dedicate the $1 billion to the fund.

The $20 billion is far short of what the state needs to maintain its water infrastructure. According to one estimate, Texas communities need nearly $154 billion over the next 50 years for projects. Both rural and urban communities will be able to tap the fund to address their existing infrastructure needs.

“Today’s vote shows that Texans across the political spectrum understand the stakes and are ready to invest in solutions that will protect our water for generations,” said Jennifer Walker, a special adviser to the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund.

“Investing in our water infrastructure now means fewer leaks, safer drinking water, conservation of natural resources, and a stronger economy that can support families and communities for decades.”

The money will be managed by the Texas Water Development Board, the state agency that oversees the state’s water supply. Funding would be divided into two categories: water supply projects, and other existing water programs.

Water supply projects would expand the overall volume of water available in Texas. Projects that could be paid for include desalination, which cleans salty water for drinking and agricultural use, fixing leaking pipes, water reuse, which includes treating wastewater and produced water from the oil and gas industry, conservation strategies and constructing permitted reservoirs. Existing water programs include improving flood control infrastructure and flood mitigation, ensuring clean drinking water, and agricultural water conservation.

While oil and gas, and big statewide water groups in Texas supported the proposition, some environmental groups were concerned that certain projects, like reservoirs, will be prioritized as a form of new water supply and take the land of farmers and residents who live in areas where they plan to be built.

Other organizations feared it will help fund mega projects like desalination, which they believe will help industry expansion in their communities, and that local communities will be cut out of water decisions. Some conservative groups argued that spending should not be written into the Texas Constitution.

The proposition does not greenlight projects, but rather provides a way to finance projects. Any particular project that receives funds from the Water Development Board will go through a regular application process. The Texas Water Foundation said that the proposition prohibits the use of the New Water Supply Fund for the transfer of groundwater.

The fund also comes with some oversight. Lawmakers have created a special committee to oversee the water board’s administration of the funding. The water board will be required to report on how the money is being distributed and the impact they are having in meeting state needs and the public will have a chance to give input.

“Dedicated funding is the most important tool available to address the looming water challenges and rising costs for ratepayers across the state,” said Stacey Allison Steinbach, Texas Water Association’s Executive Director.

Even if all current commitments are fully implemented, global temperatures would still rise by 2.3-2.5°C, well above the 1.5-2°C targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Under the Trump administration, the US has retracted several pollution controls and climate policies, which could add up to 0.1 degree Celsius to future global warming projections.
The European Union is reportedly attempting to align at least 15 of its 27 nations’ targets ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.
In 2022, the UN climate change panel issued a report, arguing that unchecked global warming presents ""a threat to human well-being and planetary health.""","A new United Nations report warns that the world is failing to meet its main climate targets, and is likely to temporarily exceed the 1.5°C threshold of warming within the next decade.

The Details: The UN’s Emissions Gap Report 2025 highlights a widening gap between national climate pledges and actual policies, projecting that current measures would result in roughly 2.8°C of warming by the end of the century. Even if all current commitments are fully implemented, global temperatures would still rise by 2.3-2.5°C, well above the 1.5-2°C targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said that “this will be difficult to reverse – requiring faster and bigger additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to minimize overshoot.” While the UNEP reported some progress–the world was previously on track for a 4°C rise–CO2 emissions continued to increase 2.3% in 2024 to 57.7 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent.

For Context: Among the highest CO2 emitters are China, the US, India and the European Union. China pledged to cut emissions by 7-10% from their peak by 2035. Under the Trump administration, the US has retracted several pollution controls and climate policies, which could add up to 0.1 degree Celsius to future global warming projections. The European Union is reportedly attempting to align at least 15 of its 27 nations’ targets ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. In 2022, the UN climate change panel issued a report, arguing that unchecked global warming presents ""a threat to human well-being and planetary health.""

How the Media Covered It: The Washington Times (Lean Right bias) and New York Times (Lean Left) both highlighted the slight progress reported, but that overall efforts fell short. Breitbart (Right) noted 300 mayors pledged coordinated climate action ahead of the Brazil summit. Reuters (Center) emphasized the world's failure to meet the main climate change target, and quoted a UNEP lead report author who said, “we can no longer totally avoid it.” CNN (Lean Left) and Bloomberg (Lean Left) both highlighted the role of individual countries, noting the UNEP’s argument that “countries’ slow action” have led to the increase, and that “none of the roughly 60 countries” heading to the summit “have submitted an updated climate pledge.”",https://www.allsides.com/images/meta-images/allsides-logo-open-graph.png,N,,2025-11-04 22:18:05.673660

That just changed. Wake Forest University School of Medicine’s Charlotte campus welcomed its first class in July 2025. The medical school is just one component of The Pearl, a $1.5 billion development that will transform health care and be a catalyst for the city’s continued economic growth and diversification.

Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR), an S&P 500 REIT focused on the secular megatrend of a large and growing aging population, provided the capital for The Pearl and jointly owns the project with its partners Advocate Health, the third-largest nonprofit integrated health system in the U.S., and Wexford Science & Technology, LLC, a private real estate company that partners with universities, research centers, and academic medical centers to create mixed-use “Knowledge Communities.” Alongside its partners, the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, Ventas broke ground on the project in December 2022. The grand opening of The Pearl occurred in June 2025 and marked the completion of the first 700,000 square feet of a multi-phased project potentially encompassing 3.5 million square feet.

“Our investment focus is on the longevity economy,” says Debra A. Cafaro, chairman and CEO of Ventas. “Ventas is a leader at the intersection of medicine, research, and universities, and we partner with first class companies. The Pearl fits squarely in that intersection.”

“We had tremendous local and institutional commitment to The Pearl,” Cafaro says. “Charlotte is a growing city known for its financial services economy and its leaders want to build on that with better health care and a diversified economy.”

The Pearl is the largest public-private partnership in the history of Charlotte, according to Collin Lane, senior vice president of facilities for Advocate Health, and it will bring significant benefits to the city and its residents. The Pearl is anticipated to generate 5,500 jobs on site and more than 11,500 jobs total in the region over the next 15 years, according to city officials.

About the grand opening of The Pearl, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said, “As The Pearl opens its doors, it’s not only a symbol of Charlotte’s ambitions — it’s proof that those ambitions are becoming reality.” She added, “Whether you’re a student, a job seeker, an entrepreneur, a health care professional, or simply proud to call Charlotte home, now is an exciting time to watch our city rise as a life sciences powerhouse.”

The Pearl came together quickly for a project of its size, according to Cafaro, taking three to five years from start to finish.

“For our investors, this has been a jewel of a project since the beginning because all the necessary ingredients were in place, including pre-leasing,” Cafaro says. “The high-end tenants The Pearl has attracted are interested in synergistic interactions—they want to be together in an exceptional space. When you have institutional investment, financial support, experienced partners, and you’re fulfilling a need in the community with a project like this, it dramatically increases the likelihood of success.”

The Pearl’s signature Howard R. Levine Center for Education was 100% preleased, with the entire project, including a state-of-the-art research tower, 905 Pearl Park Way, now more than 80% leased.

Another partner that helped streamline development of The Pearl was Duke Energy, says Ted Russell, president, CEO, and CFO of Wexford. The Pearl is built in a historic neighborhood and Duke Energy worked to bring in the power lines, utilities, and high-speed transmission lines that were needed for the new buildings. They also agreed to bury a lot of the lines and helped in a variety of ways during the entire project, he adds.

Paying Homage to a Community

The Pearl, located in the historic Brooklyn neighborhood of midtown Charlotte, incorporates the community history throughout the development with murals and signs. The neighborhood was predominantly Black residents, but much of its population was displaced during the 1950s through the 1970s due to urban renewal projects and highway construction.

“The community has been very supportive of The Pearl, in part because the development team engaged local residents throughout the planning stages,” Russell says. “In partnership with Advocate Health, we created the ‘Purposeful Walk’ which explains the history of the neighborhood with interactive signs. The Pearl and its open-air plaza called Jacob’s Ladder will also be open to community events.”

Russell says that local residents wanted to feel included in the economic development generated by The Pearl as well as have building access. “Many of the training opportunities and jobs that are generated are available to people without a four-year degree, which makes this project valuable to everyone,” he notes. “The leadership in Charlotte had the strategic vision to diversify the economy so it’s not dependent on the financial services industry. They view growing the academic, health care, and life sciences research fields as essential to growing the Charlotte economy.""

Innovative Research and Training Facilities

Wexford has developed nearly two dozen “Knowledge Communities” or “Innovation Districts” that link research universities with entrepreneurs and technology companies to create economic development in their cities and regions.

“We worked with Atrium Health [now part of Advocate Health] on their Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, when Advocate Health’s CEO Gene Woods reached out to us because he wanted to close the gap on health care outcomes,” Russell says.

“At The Pearl and other Knowledge Communities, we bring together primary health care providers, life science researchers, and tech-based companies to leverage the strength of the universities themselves. Those institutions serve as magnetic anchors to attract collaborations with private companies and entrepreneurs,” he adds.

Among the most prestigious tenants at The Pearl is IRCAD North America. “IRCAD is the premium global surgical training center, and this is their first U.S. license,” Russell says. About 8,000 surgeons are expected to come annually for two to five-day programs centered on the latest techniques and devices in cardiovascular, neuro, and orthopedic surgery as well as other types of surgery.

In addition to IRCAD, Siemens is opening a 60,000-square-foot Siemens Healthineers Experience Center USA at The Pearl, which features the latest technologies in imaging, diagnostics, cancer care, and advanced therapies in order to demonstrate them to health care professionals from around the world.

There is also 35,000 square feet of Connect Labs by Wexford scheduled to open in November 2025, comprised of small suites and labs for medical, tech, and life science entrepreneurs, Russell says. “They can interact with physicians in the Advocate Health buildings and with other entrepreneurs. There will be intentional programming with private industry in the field and opportunities for informal interaction,” he notes.

The location of The Pearl was driven in part by Advocate Health’s flagship hospital, Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte.

“Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center is one of the largest hospitals in the Southeastern U.S.,” says Lane. It’s the region’s only Level 1 trauma center and provides cancer treatment, transplants, a children’s hospital, and is one of the largest neuroscience centers. “This hospital brings together a high density of super-sub specialists in Charlotte, which is part of why organizations like Siemens and IRCAD are drawn here,” he adds.

Patients and medical professionals come from areas throughout the Southeast for care and training, since the Carolinas Medical Center is the only provider of some specialized treatments between Atlanta and Washington, D.C., Lane points out.

The architecture of The Pearl, meanwhile, contributes to collaboration, according to Lane. “The buildings are deliberately not siloed because we think it’s a value proposition to have undergraduates, faculty members, and researchers work adjacent to each other and alongside a training platform,” he says.

Investing in a Pipeline of Trained Professionals

The Wake Forest University School of Medicine location at The Pearl is just one part of a systematic plan to generate more highly qualified health care providers in Charlotte.

“When Wake Forest announced their intention to build a second medical school in Charlotte, there was an immediate reaction that other people in the health care industry wanted to locate nearby,” Lane says. “There are hundreds of companies in the area who could find synergies with medical researchers and other professionals.”

Advocate Health has academic relationships with numerous colleges and universities, not just Wake Forest, with the premise that multiple avenues can create a talent pipeline for health care providers. The Carolinas College of Health Sciences, co-located with the Wake Forest University School for Professional Services, is owned by Advocate Health.

“Advocate Health has also partnered with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to create a STEM program for fifth to eighth graders to bring students on field trips and engage them in other ways so they can envision themselves in various health care roles,” Lane says. “There’s an early college program from ninth grade on for students to start taking classes to prepare for a health care career.”

Creating that pipeline of talent will also attract people in other related industries to Charlotte, Lane says. In turn, the programs can be tailored to meet their needs for future employees, he says.",https://www.reit.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/media-images/triggsphoto_wexford_pearl_5web.jpg?itok=WkLXL8bw,N,,2025-11-04 22:57:33.918683

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has already approved 300 MW to be installed at Sherco. Xcel’s proposal would increase that capacity to 600 MW, making it the largest battery storage site in the upper Midwest, according to the utility. It would also add another 135.5 MW at the company’s Blue Lake facility and expand the company’s Sherco Solar facility with an additional 200-MW array.

Xcel plans to start construction on the battery storage projects in 2026, and bring them online in late 2027. The projects will use lithium iron phosphate battery cell technology that “discharge energy in four-hour increments and are quick to recharge, allowing for regular use,” the utility said in a statement.

Xcel said it plans to reuse existing grid connections for the batteries to store energy produced by wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas facilities across its system.

“Batteries help us store energy when it’s inexpensive to produce and dispatch it when needed, allowing us to continue delivering reliable electricity to customers while keeping bills low,” Shea said.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and another 710 are being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it will close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The banking industry is urging the Treasury Department to limit stablecoin rewards payments under the GENIUS Act.

In a letter Tuesday, the American Bankers Association (ABA) and state bankers associations from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico called for the agency to “broadly interpret” the law’s prohibition on interest.

The Treasury Department put out an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in September, seeking input on implementation of various provisions of the stablecoin measure, including “prohibitions on certain issuances.”

The banking associations argue that a broad interpretation of the law reflects “Congress’ intent for payment stablecoins to be used for transactions and not as investment vehicles.”

“But while Congress’s intent is clear, digital asset platforms today offer incentives to attract users to hold payment stablecoins including, high-yield rewards, token bonuses, and promotional payouts, asserting the ban on interest does not apply beyond stablecoin issuers,” the letter reads.

They also warn that allowing such rewards could draw deposits away from banks, placing strain on community banks in particular.

However, the crypto industry has pushed back on these arguments, contending that the banks are trying to block new competition and are overstating the impacts of deposit outflows.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:18:31.109709

AUSTIN — Governor Greg Abbott celebrated Texas being named America’s Top Business Climate for the third year in a row by Site Selection magazine.

“Texas once again emerges as the national champion for the top business climate in America,” said Governor Abbott. “As the eighth-largest economy in the world, Texas offers the freedom and opportunity for companies of all sizes and all industries to thrive. Coupled with the pro-growth, pro-business laws I signed this year, Texas improved the process of doing business to help them succeed in our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with job-creating businesses to ensure that Texas remains the top state in the nation to do business.”

Driving Texas’ top ranking is a powerful combination of factors: the number of job-creating corporate relocation and expansion projects, a pro-growth mindset and environment where enterprise can flourish, investments in workforce development and infrastructure, access to technology and tech talent, and a predictable regulatory landscape.

Another key measure contributing to Site Selection magazine’s Top Business Climate ranking is a survey of corporate real estate executives and site selectors—for which Texas earned top marks, beating out all other states.

Earlier this year, Governor Abbott accepted Site Selection magazine’s Governor’s Cup for a record-shattering 13th consecutive win for Texas as the nation’s top-performing state for job-creating business relocations and expansions. Texas also won the 2025 Prosperity Cup from Site Selection magazine, which recognizes the top state in the U.S. for attracting new business investments.

Despite this, the company’s stock fell by 3.46% in aftermarket trading. The earnings per share (EPS) was below the forecast at -0.06 USD, with a net loss of $23.8 million, compared to a $18.2 million loss in the previous year.

Key Takeaways

Clean Energy’s Q3 revenue exceeded forecasts by $2.49 million.

The company reported a net loss of $23.8 million, larger than the previous year.

Stock price declined 3.46% in aftermarket trading despite revenue beat.

Clean Energy maintained its 2025 outlook with significant RNG production growth expected in 2026.

Company Performance

Clean Energy Fuels exhibited strong revenue growth in Q3 2025, driven by increased fuel sales and station construction. Despite this, the company faced a net loss of $23.8 million, partly due to $3 million in one-time costs and the absence of alternative fuel tax credits that were applicable in 2024. The company continues to focus on expanding its renewable natural gas (RNG) operations, which it sees as a sustainable and economically viable solution for the transportation sector.

Financial Highlights

Revenue: $106.1 million, up 8% year-over-year

Adjusted EBITDA: $17.3 million

Cash and short-term investments: $232 million

Net loss: $23.8 million, compared to $18.2 million in 2024

Earnings vs. Forecast

Clean Energy’s Q3 revenue of $106.1 million surpassed the forecast of $103.65 million, representing a 2.4% surprise. However, the EPS of -0.06 USD did not meet expectations, contributing to the net loss reported.

Market Reaction

Following the earnings release, Clean Energy’s stock fell by 3.46% in aftermarket trading. This decline was observed despite the revenue beat, potentially influenced by the larger-than-expected net loss and the absence of certain tax credits.

Outlook & Guidance

The company maintained its 2025 outlook, expecting RNG production to nearly double in 2026. Clean Energy anticipates gradual improvement in low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credit prices between 2026 and 2027 and is awaiting the finalization of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit rules. The projected RNG production for the end of 2025 is 5-6 million gallons, with a target of close to 20 million gallons by 2027.

Executive Commentary

CEO Andrew Littlefair stated, ""We believe our formula of practical decarbonization at a lower cost per mile than diesel will continue to resonate with fleets and shippers."" He emphasized the importance of RNG as a viable low-emission solution, particularly in the heavy-duty transportation sector.

Risks and Challenges

The absence of alternative fuel tax credits could impact future profitability.

Fluctuations in fuel margins and oil-to-gas price spreads may affect financial performance.

The success of new RNG projects and technology adoption remains uncertain.

Regulatory changes and delays in credit rule finalizations could pose risks.

Q&A

During the earnings call, analysts inquired about the challenges of ramping up RNG production and the variability in RNG volume growth. The company also addressed potential adoption of new engine technologies and analyzed fuel margin dynamics.

Conference Call Operator: Today, everyone, and welcome to today’s Clean Energy Fuels third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question at any time by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. Please note this call is being recorded. I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Robert Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Operator. Earlier this afternoon, Clean Energy released financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2025. If you did not receive the release, it is available on the investor relations section of the company’s website, where the call is also being webcast. There will be a replay available on the website for 30 days. Before we begin, we’d like to remind you that some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance, and the company’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in the risk factor section of Clean Energy’s Form 10-Q filed today.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this release. The company’s non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA will be reviewed on this call and exclude certain expenses that the company’s management does not believe are indicative of the company’s core business operating results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The directly comparable GAAP information, reasons why management uses non-GAAP information, a definition of non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP figures is provided in the company’s press release, which has been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K today.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Littlefair.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Bob. I’m pleased to report that our business delivered another strong quarter. For the third quarter, we posted $106 million in revenue, sold 61 million gallons of renewable natural gas, and generated $17 million of Adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter meeting our expectations in line with the raised guidance for 2025 that we announced in August. With $232 million in cash and short-term investments and maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample financial flexibility and capacity to fund growth. Today, I will provide updates on our downstream fueling business, RNG’s opportunity in the heavy-duty truck sector, and progress in our upstream RNG production business. I’ll let Bob provide more detail on our financials and our reaffirmed full-year outlook. Our downstream fueling business continues to perform well.

Transit and refuse remain steady contributors, reflecting longstanding customer relationships and our ability to deliver clean, affordable fuel day in and day out. For over two decades, natural gas trucks and buses have delivered cleaner air and lower emissions to these fleets and the cities they serve. On the refuse side, we currently have 140 different companies ranging from national leaders like WM and Republic Services to many regional companies around the country, 309 fueling sites. And we fuel the buses of transit agencies from New York City to LA and many in between. We are well positioned to support additional fleets in their adoption of ultra-clean RNG. Clean Energy also continues to support transit agencies that are following California state incentives to explore hydrogen alongside RNG. In late September, we announced we were awarded the contract to design, build, and maintain a second hydrogen fueling station for Foothill Transit.

This extends our 20-plus-year partnership with the agency and complements the RNG fuel fleet Foothill already operates. The new site will support an initial 19 hydrogen fuel cell buses. We’ve also won awards to build hydrogen stations for the cities of Riverside and Ventura transit agencies. The largest opportunity for our downstream fueling business continues to be heavy-duty trucking. Approximately 250,000 new Class 8 heavy-duty trucks are sold each year in the U.S. and Canada. The heavy-duty sector is tasked with providing critical goods movement services across our economy. Meanwhile, the sector has been facing challenging freight rates, uncertain policy regulations, and continued demand from shippers to lower emissions in this hard-to-decarbonize segment of the value chain. As you know, overall sales of heavy-duty trucks have been significantly lower over the last year or two compared to most years. Battery electric and hydrogen face significant challenges for heavy-duty trucking.

RNG, on the other hand, is low NOx and has low to negative greenhouse gas emissions, yet does this at a lower cost of ownership than even diesel. The engine technology, infrastructure, and reliable supply of clean fuel are here today. And at Clean Energy, we are pursuing this opportunity on multiple fronts. In September. Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions launched as the first leasing company focused on low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles with next-generation CNG trucks as the focus. Clean Energy, alongside Cummins and Hexagon Agility, partnered with Pioneer to support another pathway that lowers barriers for fleets to adopt RNG-powered equipment. Just last week, we expanded our Class 8 demo truck program with a 2026 Freightliner Cascadia Gen 5 day cab equipped with the Cummins X15N.

Our truck was unveiled at the American Trucking Associations’ conference to high praise from the senior editor of Transport Topics, a leading trucking publication, who did a test drive. The demo truck will rotate among carriers so they can experience the X15N’s performance across real routes in our fueling network. This builds on the success of our first Peterbilt X15N demo launch last year, and that continues to be in rotation around the country. Since Freightliner has the largest overall market share in the heavy-duty space, the demand to get in the queue for this new demo truck has been very high. Turning to our upstream RNG production business, while RIN pricing has stabilized, LCFS credit prices continue to face some headwinds impacting segment profitability. We expect CARB’s program changes, which are already in effect, to tighten the market and support gradual price improvement in 2026 and beyond.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is an important value driver for dairy RNG that recognizes the fuel’s negative emissions benefit. We continue to await Treasury’s finalization of the 45Z rules and credit values, which we expect in the next few months. We plan to begin to monetize our 2025 45Z credits once those rules are finalized. Meanwhile, we are controlling what we can control: project execution and production improvement. I’m pleased to report that our two largest dairy projects, one in Texas and one in Idaho, have recently begun initial operations. We will be announcing more specifics soon about these exciting developments. This brings our total projects in operation to eight. We continue to be focused on optimizing production across our portfolio to increase our own supply of negative carbon RNG for our network.

100% of the fuel that we sell in California is RNG, and the average carbon intensity score of that fuel is minus 194. So that’s impressive. In addition, we broke ground on three new dairy RNG projects under our development agreement with Moss Energy Works. These projects span six dairies across South Dakota, Georgia, Florida, and New Mexico, and are expected to produce three million gallons of RNG annually once fully operational. In summary, our business fundamentals remain solid. The downstream fueling business is steady and well-positioned for growth. And on the upstream side, we’re executing and scaling. Clean Energy is uniquely positioned with the largest RNG fueling network, a substantial supply of RNG from our own operations and from third parties, and a team that knows how to deliver for our customers.

We believe our formula of practical decarbonization at a lower cost per mile than diesel will continue to resonate with fleets and shippers that need solutions they can deploy today. And with that, I’ll hand the call back to Bob.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Andrew. And good afternoon to everyone. The third quarter of 2025 was another good quarter on $106.1 million in revenue. Versus $104.9 million a year ago. Last year’s revenue included $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credit revenues, and the alternative fuel tax credit is not in place for 2025 as it was not extended past 2024. So putting the alternative fuel tax credit aside, the increase in revenues over last year’s third quarter was 8%, primarily driven by increases in fuel sales along with a rise in station construction sales. On a GAAP basis, our net loss for the third quarter of 2025 was $23.8 million versus $18.2 million in 2024, with the 2024 net loss benefiting from the $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credits not applicable to 2025.

And as well, our 2025 GAAP net loss included $3 million in net incremental costs for a couple of one-time items, one of those being $5 million in incremental accelerated depreciation expense that was tied to our pilot stations, bringing that total depreciation charge in line with our initial estimates. And the second one-time item was a $2 million non-operating gain from the liquidation of a non-core investment. These two items did not impact adjusted EBITDA. Speaking of which, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $17.3 million. And reflects similar and steady trends from our recent second quarter of 2025, with good fuel and service margins, plus an improvement in our upstream dairy negative adjusted EBITDA. Last year, adjusted EBITDA of $21.3 million, of course, includes the $6.4 million of alternative fuel tax credits.

When excluding the alternative fuel tax credits from 2024, the improvements in 2025 over 2024 continue to come from greater fuel volumes, including both conventional natural gas and RNG. Particularly a higher concentration of low-CI dairy RNG, along with lower operating expenses from a year ago third quarter. These improvements helped to offset the effects of lower RIN pricing from a year ago, where you can see the RIN revenue is down $2.8 million versus last year. We generated cash flow from operations again in the third quarter, and our cash and investment balance of $232 million that Andrew mentioned is our balance after making a $12 million contribution of capital into our dairy RNG joint venture with Moss Energy Works in the third quarter. And lastly, you’ll note that we maintained our 2025 outlook, which we had raised back in August, and we feel good.

We feel that we’re in good shape in maintaining that outlook. And with that, operator, we can open the call to questions.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star 2. Once again, that is Star 1 to ask a question. We’ll take our first question from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Hi, Andrew. Hi, Bob.

Hi, Eric.

Hey. So maybe just starting with the RNG upstream business. So it sounds like you’ve got eight operating right now. Can you just give us kind of the thought or target, maybe run rate of volumes that you expect to exit 2025? And as you think about this longer term, I know that market has changed a bit. You’ve got a lot of supply from third-party sources. So just kind of curious how you think about that when you look out multiple years. At one time, you had a pretty high target for what you might ultimately produce upstream. Curious where that stands now.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Right. So, you’re bringing up the production rates of the five that came online. We call them the Renuco projects. But you’ll exit the year somewhere between five and six million gallons. And next year, you’ll double it. Close to doubling it. And eventually, you’ll be closer to 20 million gallons once those projects come on. And now I’m going out. That’s once those Moss projects are on. And so now I’m going out to 2027. Eric, you’re referring to what we came out with almost five years ago, four and a half years ago, the 100 million gallons, which, by the way, would have taken another $1.2 or $4 billion. And we pulled that back long ago when we looked at the credit pricing and some of the current situation. But what I will say is we like where we are.

We like having that amount of fuel that we control. But we’re very big in the business, as you well know. And we have 80-90 different suppliers. So we’re moving still about half of all the RNG into transportation in the industry. We continue to be at the focal point of that. Everyone that needs RNG into transportation often has to come to us. So we like our position. We feel like we’ve made prudent investments to this point. We have to get those up and running correctly. We’re starting to see an improved production rates, which will continue to get better and better. And we’re starting to feel much better about those early projects. We take great part in looking at the production that’s going on in our first project, Del Rio, that’s been up and running a while. And that thing’s hitting nameplate and it’s doing very well.

We’re very proud of that. And we’re beginning to start seeing some significant increases in production at the others. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Eric, our two biggest projects, one of which we own 100% of, they’re just now beginning to inject. So one of those produces somewhere around five million gallons and the other around 3.6 million. And they’re just now coming on. So we like where we are. And we’ll see how that kind of all plays out as they develop here in 2026 and in 2027.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yep. Thanks for that. And you mentioned, I know, last quarter or earlier in the year, you kind of set it as an objective to improve the performance at the plants. And you have made progress. You did mention that you’ve got a few more steps to go. I mean, any clarity there, I would assume, or should we assume that those are pretty much you just kind of have to go through steps? It takes time rather than being something that’s a significant investment.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s right. That’s right. It’s fine-tuning. It’s working with the farmer. It’s all those things. There aren’t big CapEx requirements to get them right. It’s really just kind of bringing it along, getting the team working exactly right. So. Going through the first winter and figuring out where certain other items need to be winterized is kind of mundane things, but they’re important. And what’s interesting, Eric, is you really do tune them up. From kind of when they first come on, they’re more like producing about half of what you thought. And next thing you know, they’re at 70, 75. But they will begin to pull on up to nameplate.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Got it. Last one for me. I know it’s early days still, but the Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions, just any thoughts on initial interest, what you think that might do to spur X15N adoption, just kind of initial impressions.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well, I’m told, look, I love having another interested party out working with our customers and with potential customers. I think that’s really powerful. We know this crowd. I like the fact that we’re engaged in standing that company up alongside Cummins and Hexagon Agility. I think that’s good alignment for us. I’m told they have their first deal in the works. I’m not going to say any more than that, but they have maybe their first paper out circulating and that they’ve already had meetings with 20 different fleets. I think they did some. Showed the flag pretty well down there in San Diego at the ATA. So I like the fact that you have a very focused group working just on RNG, just on natural gas trucks, understands the nuance there on leasing.

And so we’re working hard, hand in glove with them, our sales team, as is Hexagon and Cummins. So we’ll see how they do.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Okay. Thanks.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. Speaking of the 15-liter kind of ramp rates and how that’s developing in the market. Good to see the Pioneer project. But what’s sort of the other sort of timeline and development of the 15-liter ramp? How do you see it at this point with sort of the market environment today?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well, I think there’s been, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the market has not been exactly favorable, right? The freight rate thing is real. That’s a real overhang in the trucking business. And it has affected purchases of new trucks. So that’s just something you wish can get worked off. I think you’re going to have softer rates that will begin to firm. But as I read the material, it looks like that could take a good part of 2026. So that’s just some headwinds there that I’d rather not have. It’s hard to get people to make a move toward not only buying new equipment, but buying new technology when they’re worried about tariffs and import duties and supply chain and their freight rates. Now, having said that, I think that most in the industry have seen that there’s kind of a shaking out.

I mean, as you take stock of what occurred down there at the ATA conference in San Diego, I mean, it’s clear that there’s been a sorting out of the technology. I mean, look, I’m not wishing ill on anything, but I think that the electric and the hydrogen technologies really have gotten knocked down a peg because of their reliance on certain of the regulations and such, certainly at the federal level. And so now it’s very clear that if you’re a trucker, you have diesel, renewable diesel, or you have RNG. And what’s coming through is, Rob, that the fleets and the shippers still want sustainability, still want to be green, still want to decarbonize, but it has to make economic sense. That’s what’s different now, is that this has to stand on its own bottom.

Now, the good news for us is we have a technology and we have an engine that’s here today and can be delivered today that can give returns. I mean, with our fuel pricing and with the economics associated with the incremental cost, we can get these fleets a two-year payback, two and a half-year payback on the equipment, and then they really have significant savings as they keep that truck up to the typical five years. So we like our positioning from that point of view. Now, we’ve had fleets such as Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, SAIA, Knight-Swift, Food Express. I mean, they’ve all purchased the new X15N. So I like the breadth. Now, we need more to acquire, and we need those fleets to really engage fully. But we’re seeing some breadth of people beginning to take that in, get comfortable with it.

And then we hope there’ll be those kinds of fleets buy a lot of trucks. We hope that as they like what they’ve got and they’re operating well, that we’ll see increased adoption in the coming years. But we’re working hard with making sure that we’re getting good exposure to the X15N with the largest fleets in America. And so far, most of them have taken some.

Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color there. And then on the Moss Energy development, how much is the CapEx requirement on your side for the three facilities? And then I guess what’s sort of the pipeline on the Moss side that you could see additional facilities on?

Hold on one second. It’s about 35. Yeah, 36 million.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: 35 million.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: We’ve sent 12 over. In the third quarter.

Okay. Good. And then just in terms of the additional potential projects with Moss, is there still a pipeline there, or do you feel like this is sort of it for what you see right now?

Well, Daryl’s a busy guy. So we’ve got those projects that I mentioned, the three projects. We constantly work with Daryl to see. There’s a couple others that we had looked at very closely. But just with the given credit situation, they didn’t sing quite like we’d like. And Daryl understood that. So we’ll continue to look at those. We like the fact that he’s a very good operator and brings these projects on quickly and efficiently. So we’ll see. Yeah. And we’ll have about, well, for this, what we have in front of us, so $35 million was in the cards for this year, but we’ll have about $85 million in total. Yeah. For the plan that’s in front of us with him.

Okay. Great. Thank you. I’ll turn it over.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Texas Capital. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. Congrats on a solid update, guys.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you.

Maybe starting with the downstream, you guys announced a flurry of supply agreements last week. Could you speak to what led to that step change in activity and when those volumes will directionally start to flow through?

In many ways, we have hundreds and hundreds of customers, right? So at any given time, while we don’t always announce all of them, because sometimes they’re just not as glamorous, let’s say, every year, we have a couple hundred different customers that grow their fleet and renew contracts with us. And so you’re getting a little bit of that mix in there. Now, there were some wins, but I want to say that when you have the size of the network and the fact that we have about 800 or 900 customers under a contract, there’s a lot of activity kind of constantly. We had some extra transit properties in that release, but we have quite a few new refuse customers and additions coming up right now. So I don’t know if there’s some sea change that just happened.

It’s just kind of the way our cycle tends to ebb and flow, but I do like the fact that we have a lot of activity. And that makes us feel optimistic about these fleets as they continue with the program.

Great. Understood. And then regarding the two larger projects that you guys have just brought on. Could you offer maybe some directional thoughts on the timing of certification of environmental attributes, including RINs, LCFS, and 45Z credits? I know that the LCFS backlog was quite extensive at one point, but just where is that today? Where does that sit today?

These, let me handle it this way, and if I get too far out, someone will jump in here and save me. But these things take a while to really get up, and so there’s kind of a process for them to get into revenue production. I mean, and we’re just now kind of taking care of the commissionings. I mean, the Texas property is a few weeks ahead of the Idaho property. After about a month of operations or so, the EPA has been pretty fast after two or three weeks time often that we’re able to begin to certify to be able to get the RINs. Now, the LCFS, there’s a provisional and another kind of certification where at some point after time, we begin to participate and I guess collect at about a minus 150, right?

And then eventually, over time, we get the final processing from California, the LCFS. But that has taken on our Del Rio project the better part of almost two years. Now, we think that that backlog has gotten corrected some. But I would say by the time you’re really hitting your stride and all buttoned up with the certification process, I mean, it’s the better part of 2026 for these projects before you’re really done with that. Now, you’ll be receiving credits and being able to monetize credits, but not at their full potential.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Understood. Thanks for your time, guys.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Okay. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH. Please go ahead.

Thank you. And good afternoon. And congrats on the strong results in the third quarter. You mentioned that you kept your 2025 EBITDA guide intact, which, if I’m doing the math right, implies, I think it’s $8 million-$13 million for the fourth quarter, even though the fourth quarter tends to be pretty strong for Clean. So I guess how should we think about this? I think in the past, you’ve been reluctant to change your guide so late in the year and effectively provide single-quarter guidance. But I guess, is it fair to think that there might be some upside to the 2025 targets? Or how should we think about that here?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Probably. Right? I mean. As you look at it, it looks like. It looks like that we should, we’re doing well. I don’t think it’s—I don’t think we’re in a position to really now tick it up. That. At this point. But I think as you’re looking at it, you’re saying, ""Huh, these guys are going to be certainly on the top end of the guidance or maybe a little bit beyond that."" I mean, that’s reasonable if you thought that way. And we’ll see how it performs. There’s a lot of things that work here, but.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. I mean, I think.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s how I feel too.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And we kind of agree that at that point, maybe you’re micromanaging a quarter.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Yeah.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And I think we feel good with that range that we’d put out there. And where we sit right now, too, to be comfortable with that. But we weren’t going to, we’re not going to micromanage it.

Sounds good. And then just looking at your RNG volume growth this year, it’s been a little variable. I think in the first quarter, it was down 13% year over year. Second quarter, up 8%. This quarter, up 3%. I guess, could you help us understand why has it been so variable? Is that due to the supply that’s coming to Clean, that there’s some variability in those volumes, or are there other factors?

Well, there was, Matthew. There certainly was in the first quarter, right, where there were cold spells throughout the country and all the RNG producers, the dairy producers were having execution difficulties because of that cold weather. So you saw a bit of a drop. And then there was a bit of a rebound in the second quarter. We also have the biogas reform where gas was held at year-end. So then that kind of floods in. It came in. Well, in the second quarter, we had an uptick primarily from the cold weather in the first quarter. And so that was a little bit distorted in terms of its growth. And then I think the third quarter, our third quarter here was maybe a little bit more normalized, if you will. So you’ve got, yeah. So there’s some variations in there.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Betty Zhang with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I first wanted to ask about. Maybe if you could give us a preliminary look at expectations for 2026. And in particular, if you could speak to. Volumes. Should we expect a pretty big step up given. Your production of RNG that’s ramping up? And as well. Should we be accounting for the. X15N gallons, or is it still too early for that?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Betty, we’re not going to. It’s history is the guide. We’re not going to share today set our guidance for 2026. I mean. I think if you go back and listen to what I said earlier on this call, I gave about as much guidance as we’re going to give on the RNG. From our end, right? And so. In the scheme of things, it’s a nice growth from our, from where we’ve been to where we’re going next year. But it’s not a step change type thing. But go back and listen to that. I mean, basically, what I said, we’re exiting the year around four to five to six, and that it’ll get close to doubling, right? That’s from our RNG production. So that kind of gives you a thought for that. The adoption is hard to tell, Betty. And I don’t have a crystal ball here.

And I don’t. Over the years, we’ve worked hard to be in the high single digits. But it’s just. I think it’s too hard to tell exactly how the adoption rate for the X15N is going to be for, as I sit here today, for next year. Over the course of the last several years with the nine-liter at Cummins, I mean, we have seen dramatic adoption rates over time. But it takes time. And you’re kind of in the early phase of that with the X15N. And there’s a lot of uncertainty with regulations in California and the federal government. And so it’s a lot at work. And yet. We feel optimistic that you’re getting the right fleets experiencing with it to get to increased rates of adoption. But I guess I’m crawfishing around, Betty. No, I’m not going to give you the exact growth number, but. It’ll be.

We should see increased rates of adoption in 2026. Let’s put it that way. But of course, you’re coming off of low levels of adoption right now in the X15N.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Okay. Fair enough. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the fuel margin. Looking forward to the next several periods, our view is that the WTI to Henry Hub spread should narrow or may narrow. So I just wanted to get a sense of how Clean Energy is able to kind of manage the fuel margin, what leverage you guys could pull on that end.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Bob and I watched that as well very closely. As you know, there’s been a nice fuel margin throughout most of 2025. That’s narrow. Not only is it going to narrow, it has narrowed some from kind of historical differentials, the oil and gas spread to where you are today, right? Today, you have $4.25 gas and $60 a little more oil. You’ve come down to 15 to 1. Now, we tend to think, Betty, that that will be, that’s mid-teens to 15, 16, 17 to 1 is probably a good spread. With that, we’re in, that’s good for us. That’s very good for us. We can maintain the kinds of fuel margins that we’ve seen this year in that. Now, what’s difficult is if you have $40 oil and you have $4 natural gas or $4.50 natural gas and $35 crude.

I guess our view is, as we look out, that we see the relationship between oil and natural gas kind of staying in this 15 to 1 spread where you are right today. I think that’s pretty much where you’re going to be. I mean, frankly, Betty, I think you may see oil come down some. I mean, that seems to be, that could be. I don’t think you’re going to, right now, you’re seeing sort of winter pricing on the gas curve. That gas cost should come down. I think you’ll, as I said, I think the 15 to 1 is probably 15, 16 to 1 is probably a pretty good spread.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. Along with the other drivers that we have within our margin of RNG and LCFS pricing around that. So. We don’t have everything all concentrated in one.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: No. One of the beauties. No. We have a lot of the West Coast.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: The red spot around the country.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Refined products of diesel. I mean, diesel today in California is $5.25. So.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: That’s helpful.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That has to get factored in too.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Right.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one quick one. I know that as you guys kind of ramp your RNG upstream next year, 2026, I know there are a bunch of puts and takes, 45Z, LCFS, D3. Just trying to figure out what are some of the sensitivities to think about for that segment to get to a bit positive. Any kind of thoughts, Carlo, that you can share? Is that a 2026 story, 2027? Or do we need to see D3 or LCFS or 45Z to kind of get to those levels?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: You got a lot of things.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Yeah. You got a lot of things. Let me start, and then Bob, where I mess up, you can chime in. We do think that the LCFS program as outlined by CARB is going to lead over time, over next year, to a strengthened LCFS price. It’s anybody’s guess exactly where it is. But. Our partners and us, we think that 2026 is going to be better in 2025, and 2027 is going to be better in 2026. And so that should be strengthening. I mean, CARB believes that the LCFS, by the time you get to 2028, 2029, could be back to where we were at $120-$135, $150. So. That’s good. Maybe we’ve seen the bottom, and that should be strengthening. So that’s good for our business. We, as I said on our call, we have to work on what we control.

Is we have to get the capacity and the production levels up at the plants. And we feel confident now that we’ve really taken firmer control of the operations. We’ll get there. But that’s important to us. For these things to perform correctly. Almost as important as what’s happening on the environmental pricing side. So we’ve got to get these things. Feel very good about these two large projects that we just brought on now because they’ve commissioned well. And I think we learned from some of our earlier projects. We’ve got to get all these projects performing better. And then. You really can see them perform like they should. And you’ll have strengthening LCFS prices over time. I think RINs, I would say maybe the cautious view there is. We’ve seen those stabilize.

And I’m not smart enough to figure how the small refinery exemptions factored into the maybe a potential change in the RVO. Some have said that it could lead to RIN strengthening some. I don’t know. But. We sort of like where the RIN is now because it’s stabilized at $2.30 or so. And that works fine for us. So. Productivity enhancements on our plants. And we do see a strengthening of the LCFS credit in the future.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And then the production tax credit as well, 45Z. If that changes in our favor. With the guidance comes out from the Treasury if they.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s better.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. Depending on where that comes out, that could be some upside. But I think that. As you said, I mean, these projects at least are getting through that ramp-up phase. And it’s kind of about that kind of timing to get through the period, which going into 2026, a lot of them are. And the volume production then should show improvements there for sure.

Got it. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Andrew Littlefair for any additional or closing remarks.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to filling you in on the next quarter next year. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

Why Do Central Asia’s Minerals Struggle to Reach Western Markets?
Recommendations for Strengthening U.S.–Central Asia Minerals Cooperation Historically, the mining industry has long been a cornerstone of Central Asia’s economy.
Here are some recommendations to strengthen U.S.–Central Asia minerals cooperation.","Washington will host a C5+1 summit on November 6, marking the tenth anniversary of the regional diplomatic platform that brings together the United States and the five Central Asian states: Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Since its establishment in 2015, the C5+1 has served as the primary forum for advancing cooperation on economic, energy and minerals, and security issues. This year’s summit carries particular weight: It comes at a moment when China and Russia are rapidly deepening their foothold in Central Asia’s minerals and infrastructure, positioning themselves at the center of the region’s emerging supply chains.

In recent years, critical minerals have become a defining feature of the U.S.–Central Asia relationship. In February 2024, the United States launched the C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue to strengthen cooperation in geological exploration, attract mining and processing investments, and connect Central Asia’s mineral wealth to U.S. markets. That same year, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan joined the U.S.-led Minerals Security Partnership Forum, signaling their commitment to building more resilient supply chains less dependent on China. To date, efforts have focused on dialogue over action.

The region holds vast reserves of minerals critical to U.S. economic and national security, including uranium, chromite, copper, titanium, gold, and antimony, as well as emerging deposits of rare earth elements and other strategic metals. Mining remains a key pillar of the region’s two largest economies, contributing roughly 17 percent of GDP in Kazakhstan and 8 percent in Uzbekistan, reflecting Central Asia’s deep mining heritage and existing social licenses that enable industrial expansion. Recent commercial deals, such as Uzbekistan’s $8.5 billion aircraft procurement deal with Boeing and Kazakhstan’s $4.2 billion locomotive contract with Wabtec, further reveal a growing U.S.–Central Asia economic momentum.

Yet, despite these developments, tangible progress in minerals cooperation remains limited. Chinese and Russian capital dominate the region’s mining, processing, and logistics networks, while structural barriers, ranging from underdeveloped westward transport routes to recurring energy shortages, continue to deter Western investment. The upcoming C5+1 summit offers Washington a narrow but strategic window to translate diplomacy into concrete investment and position the United States, not its rivals, as a credible new partner in Central Asia’s evolving minerals landscape.

Central Asia’s Mineral Reserves and Production

Central Asia holds substantial reserves of minerals designated by the United States as critical. Kazakhstan, the region’s largest economy, is the world’s leading uranium supplier, producing 23,270 metric tons or 39 percent of global output in 2024. The country also leads the region in exploration spending, reaching a decade-high of $127 million in 2025, nearly half of which targets copper projects. Uzbekistan has likewise emerged as a promising mining center. In 2024, it announced the discovery of new deposits, containing tungsten, lithium, and germanium, along with 14 rare earth element sites, signaling strong potential for future development. Tajikistan, meanwhile, ranks second globally in antimony production, accounting for 15 percent of the world’s supply, further highlighting the region’s strategic importance in global minerals supply chains.

Despite this potential, Central Asia’s mineral exports remain heavily oriented toward China and Russia, limiting opportunities for diversification and Western engagement. Kazakhstan, which leads regional production, sends 27 percent of its mineral exports to China and 16 percent to Russia, while the United States accounts for only 5 percent. Uzbekistan shows a similar pattern, with China, Russia, and Turkey as its main export destinations. Central Asia’s China- and Russia-focused export patterns reveal a heavy reliance on eastward corridors and a lack of infrastructure linking the region to Western markets.

Central Asia’s Role in U.S. Nuclear Security

Kazakhstan is the world’s largest uranium powerhouse. In 2022, it produced more than 21,000 tons, or roughly 45 percent of the world’s supply. By comparison, Canada, the world’s second-largest producer, produced 7,000 tons. That same year, Uzbekistan ranked fifth, contributing around 7 percent of global supply. Together, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan account for just over half of the world’s uranium production, making the global market highly sensitive to developments in Central Asia. This vulnerability was underscored in January 2022, when political unrest in Kazakhstan triggered an 8 percent spike in uranium prices in a single day, revealing the strategic fragility of supply chains tied to the region.

Central Asia’s influence on the uranium market is expected to grow further. The question is whether the United States will partner effectively with these markets. China has moved aggressively to deepen its foothold in the region. It has been purchasing natural uranium from Kazakhstan since the early 2000s and maintains multiple long-term contracts across suppliers. Through its close partnership with Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state nuclear company, China now offtakes nearly 30 percent of Kazakhstan’s uranium exports—cementing a significant degree of influence over one of the world’s most strategic uranium sources.

Uranium is a bedrock of U.S. energy security, accounting for 19 percent of U.S. electricity, and the United States remains the world’s largest nuclear power producer. However, that leadership is under pressure. Years of stagnation and plant retirements have slowed U.S. growth, while China is rapidly expanding its fleet—on pace to surpass U.S. nuclear capacity by 2030, with 150 new reactors expected between 2020 and 2035. Ensuring a stable uranium supply has therefore become one of the most critical factors in preserving U.S. nuclear leadership. The United States remains reliant on Russia, an adversary, for much of its uranium; in 2022, 30 percent of imports came from Russia. Over the next five years, global demand is expected to surge by nearly 30 percent. Achieving these goals, while de-risking nuclear power supply, will require not only a massive increase in uranium supply but also secure, diversified, and resilient supply chains.

Why Do Central Asia’s Minerals Struggle to Reach Western Markets?

Despite Central Asia’s abundance of mineral resources, the region’s ability to fully capitalize on new partnerships with the West, particularly with the United States, remains constrained by inadequate transport infrastructure. Most export routes still run north to south, a legacy of Soviet-era railway construction that prioritized moving raw materials toward Russia to support its industrial base. As a result, Central Asia remains heavily dependent on Russian rail and maritime infrastructure for shipping minerals to Europe and the U.S. In Kazakhstan, the region’s primary transit hub, an estimated 57 percent of railway tracks are in disrepair, further limiting export capacity.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Central Asian countries relied on the Northern Corridor, which passes through Russia to the Black and Baltic Seas, to transport energy resources and minerals to global markets. After the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia, regional governments shifted focus toward developing the Middle Corridor, a multimodal trade route connecting China to Europe via Central Asia and the South Caucasus. The corridor’s transit time of 16–20 days is comparable to the 14–18 days via the northern route.

At the same time, Central Asia’s power constraints, rooted in its Soviet legacy, pose a major barrier to expanding mineral production and processing. Under the Soviet system, power generation and distribution were centrally managed across the republics, with little regard for modern borders or national energy needs. After independence, all five states were left scrambling to balance generation, energy imports, and domestic demand.

Mining is highly energy-intensive, yet much of Central Asia still depends on aging power plants and outdated transmission lines, limiting its ability to scale up mineral output. The region faces high transmission and distribution losses, as well as frequent seasonal blackouts that can disrupt mining operations. In Kazakhstan, transmission losses reach about 15 percent, while in Uzbekistan, distribution losses are estimated at around 13 percent. Rolling blackouts are also common across all five states during both harsh winters and extreme summer heat, with temperatures in Turkmenistan often exceeding 50° C.

Power demand continues to grow rapidly, driven by industrial expansion, but capacity additions have lagged far behind. Central Asia’s population has also risen from roughly 50 million in 1991 to about 84 million today, further straining grids. Upgrading national and regional networks, and integrating renewable energy sources to provide reliable electricity for mining, would require at least $20 billion in investment in Central Asia by 2030.

Recommendations for Strengthening U.S.–Central Asia Minerals Cooperation

Historically, the mining industry has long been a cornerstone of Central Asia’s economy. During the Soviet era, the region supplied Moscow with a wide range of minerals, including copper, coal, lead, uranium, tantalum, zinc, and rare earth elements, that supported the Soviet Union’s industrial base. Most geological exploration was conducted before the 1990s under the centralized Soviet system for mineral prospecting, and after independence, Central Asian states relied heavily on those legacy surveys to sustain output and attract investors.

In recent years, however, the region’s mining industry has been reinvigorated as governments pursue national strategies to integrate into global critical minerals supply chains. Uzbekistan has launched a $2.6 billion initiative to advance 76 critical minerals projects over the next three years, while Kazakhstan introduced a five-year development plan focused on attracting foreign investment, expanding processing capacity, and strengthening mining governance.

Western interest has also grown sharply. In 2024, the U.S. Department of State signed memoranda of understanding with both Kazakhstan’s National Geological Survey and the government of Uzbekistan. In spring 2025, the European Union committed $2.9 billion under its Global Gateway initiative to support exploration and critical minerals development across all five Central Asian states. Around the same time, France, Germany, and South Korea concluded additional agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to conduct geological exploration and invest in early-stage mining projects.

Although the United States has found it difficult to deepen ties with a region that is both geographically distant and strategically situated between its two primary rivals—China and Russia—Central Asia will play a key role in the future of minerals security. Here are some recommendations to strengthen U.S.–Central Asia minerals cooperation.

Strengthen U.S.–Central Asia vertical integration for uranium supply chains: Kazakhstan has affirmed that it has no plans to pursue uranium enrichment in the foreseeable future—making it a valuable strategic partner for the United States, which currently produces little uranium but is rapidly expanding enrichment capabilities in New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Establishing strategic uranium production in Kazakhstan, paired with offtake agreements for enrichment in the United States, could significantly reduce reliance on Russian supply chains while bolstering the uranium availability needed to achieve the United States’ ambitious nuclear energy goals.

Engage Gulf partners to coinvest in Central Asia’s mining and infrastructure: For more than three decades, the United States has struggled to engage in large-scale infrastructure and mining projects in Central Asia beyond the oil and gas sector, a challenge driven by geographic distance and the region’s proximity to China and Russia. However, the recent strengthening of ties between Central Asian states and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries presents a strategic opportunity for U.S. engagement. Gulf partners such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar have become active investors in Central Asia’s transportation and energy infrastructure. Recent agreements between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan with the United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s Masdar and Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power to develop renewable energy projects underscore this trend. Central Asian governments are eager to see a greater U.S. role in the minerals space, and joint investments with Gulf partners, whether in mining projects or supporting transport and power infrastructure, could de-risk capital flows and expand Western participation. Investing in Middle Corridor infrastructure to enable mineral shipments from Central Asia to Saudi Arabia or the UAE for refining would also shorten supply chains compared to oceanic routes, strengthening both regional connectivity and U.S. strategic access.

Partner with Japan and South Korea to modernize geological mapping and support exploration: Outdated Soviet-era surveys and decades of underinvestment have left much of Central Asia’s mineral wealth unexplored. In Kazakhstan, exploration spending in 1990 equaled the total spent between 2003 and 2023, while only 40 percent of Uzbekistan and 6 percent of Tajikistan have been geologically surveyed. Japan and South Korea, two of the region’s most consistent partners, are well-positioned to help modernize this foundation. The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security and the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources have signed agreements with Kazakhstan to advance mineral exploration, with KIGAM recently identifying sizable lithium reserves at the Bakennoye deposit and Japan’s ITOCHU Corporation joining an Uzbek-French-Japanese uranium venture in Navoi. Deepening cooperation with these trusted U.S. allies to update geological mapping and support early-stage exploration would unlock new reserves, improve data transparency, and strengthen collective engagement in Central Asia’s critical minerals sector.

Develop a skilled mining workforce through Western academic collaboration: While mining has long anchored Central Asia’s economy, much of its geological expertise has eroded since the Soviet era. The region has historically relied on Russian training, but diversifying education and technical collaboration is essential to improving competitiveness. Eight of the top ten mining programs in the world are based in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Examples such as the Colorado School of Mines planning to open an international campus in Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, a major copper hub, in 2026, or the S. Embassy–funded exchange program with Uzbekistan’s Navoi State Mining Institute to strengthen academic and technical cooperation, offer strong starting points for deeper U.S. engagement. Expanding such initiatives with other Western universities and training institutions would help develop a new generation of skilled mining professionals, elevate environmental, social, and governance standards, and align the region’s mining governance with Western practices, reducing operational risk and enabling deeper U.S. engagement in the region’s critical minerals industry.

Central Asia sits at the crossroads of global competition for critical minerals. The region’s abundant resources, strategic geography, and growing openness to Western partnership present an important opportunity for supply diversification. Turning diplomatic momentum into tangible outcomes will require sustained investment, coordination with allies, and the mobilization of trusted partners across the Gulf, Japan, and South Korea.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.","The numbers are in—and they show that the EV market has officially started a new chapter.

Battery-electric vehicles made up just over 5% of new-vehicle retail sales in October, according to JD Power and GlobalData. That’s down more than half from September’s all-time high of nearly 13%.

The drop-off comes after the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for EVs of up to $7,500, thanks to President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill. Industry analysts and executives predicted EV sales would fall as soon as the credits went away, and October’s sales numbers back them up.

Ford’s EV sales fell by nearly 25% YoY, while the automaker’s internal combustion engine vehicle sales grew 3.4% and its overall sales rose 1.6%.

Kia’s sales ticked up slightly in October. While the brand’s electrified vehicle sales (which include hybrids) grew by 16%, some all-electric models, including the EV6 and EV9, had lower sales.

Sister brand Hyundai reported a 2% YoY sales decline in October. Sales of the all-electric Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 models were down.

“Hybrid vehicles led the way in October with a 41% increase, and electrified sales were up 8%,” Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor North America’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we’re confident it will reset.”

Honda’s sales inched up 0.7% YoY. The Honda brand’s electrified vehicle sales (including hybrids) set a new record for the month and made up nearly one-third of brand sales, though sales of its all-electric Prologue model dropped 80% from September.

Slowdown: EV sales surged in the months leading up to the credit’s expiration, boosting the new-vehicle market.

In an analysis released before industry sales reports, data provider Urban Science reported that industry sales were down as of October 25, “driven mainly by a 43% decline in battery and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.”

Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, said he expects BEV sales “to remain behind last year’s pace through Q4 and into the early part of next year” before picking up in the spring.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.

New era: Hybrids’ market share climbed two percentage points in October to 14.2%, according to JD Power and GlobalData.

“While hybrid growth is encouraging, the recent EV market correction underscores a critical lesson: consumers prefer having access to a range of powertrain options that deliver comparable value,” Tyson Jominy, SVP of data and analytics at JD Power, said in a statement. “A singular focus on any one technology—be it EVs or hybrids—risks repeating past missteps. A diversified strategy that embraces multiple powertrain solutions will be essential to meeting evolving consumer preferences.”

Jessica Caldwell, AVP of insights for Edmunds, wrote in a blog post that “October mark[ed] the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.”

And interest remains: According to Edmunds’ data, EV buyer consideration saw only a “modest” dip, from 12.7% in September to 9% in October. Going forward, Caldwell said, the EV market will be driven less by incentives and more by considerations like model variety and ownership costs.

“The ‘reset era’ will reveal which brands and retailers can make EV ownership feel not just aspirational but practical and within reach for the next wave of buyers,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-05 00:18:36.022958

“Repealing the GHGRP would undermine decades of progress to ensure the EPA is collecting and publicly disclosing data to effectively address climate change and ensure American global competitiveness,” the Members wrote. “We urge EPA to preserve and strengthen the GHGRP knowing the important role it plays to protect hardworking American families and the value it has for businesses and investors.”

Since 2010, the GHGRP has collected and tracked vital greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases from over 8,000 sites, including landfills, power plants, and oil refineries. This rollback by the Trump Administration will strip valuable data and science needed to combat climate change, inform families of the environmental threats in their community, and eliminate good-paying jobs.

The Members continued: “It is our responsibility to protect public health, preserve our environment, and strengthen the economy of our country and our communities. The Trump Administration’s proposed rollback of GHGRP would set our country back decades and expose American families to the harmful environmental, health, and economic impacts of climate change. We demand that the EPA withdraw its proposal and strengthen and maintain a transparent and comprehensive reporting program.”

A full copy of the letter can be found here.

Background:

On September 16, 2025, the Trump EPA announced the rollback of the GHGRP.

For decades, the GHGRP has provided up-to-date information that EPA needs to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment. The GHGRP requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites across the United States. This data is an invaluable resource that is relied on by federal agencies, state and local governments, businesses, the financial industry, and community-based organizations.

Congresswoman Rivas’ letter was co-signed by Representatives Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Julia Brownley (CA-26), André Carson (IN-07), Troy Carter (LA-02), Kathy Castor (FL-14), Yvette Clarke (NY-09), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Pablo Hernandez Rivera (PR-AL), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Sara Jacobs (CA-51), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-08), John Larson (CT-01), Stephen Lynch (MA-08), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Dave Min (CA-47), Jennifer McClellan (VA-04), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jerry Nadler (NY-10), Scott Peters (CA-50), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Raul Ruíz (CA-25), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Darren Soto (FL-09), Paul Tonko (NY-20), and Nydia Velázquez (NY-07).

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.
And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.
Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.
Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.","All nations of the world had homework this year: submit new-and-improved plans to fight climate change. But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program's Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,'' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. ""We have to go faster.""

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/PDTN/87092983007-ap-25307773257233.jpg?crop=5390,3034,x3,y468&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-04 18:18:26.455190

Including Rivian.

As we meander into this electric automotive world, it’s apparent that they are more expensive to make. and therefore, more expensive to sell.

While a select few companies have been able to make affordable yet adept electric cars this year, bringing the entry barrier down, some luxury brands haven’t been able to match that trend.

However, it looks like Rivian has decided enough is enough, and to avoid being priced out, a new affordable 4×4 is on the way.

Rivian CFO says no EV tax credits have sparked a new mass-market car coming in 2026

The end of the EV tax credit in America has already left some companies scrambling.

While sales rocketed in June, now they’re in freefall, and it comes as no coincidence.

At least in the eyes of Rivian, as Chief Finance Officer, Claire McDonough revealed plans for a cheaper EV in retaliation.

“One of our core strategies and approaches to offset some of the impacts of the elimination of some of the credits for consumers is to bring a product to market that opens up the addressable market of consumers that can now say yes to a Rivian,” she said.

“It meant that we needed to reduce our costs in our vehicle roadmap.

“And the key strategy for us is to bring to market a more mass-market-priced product, which is coming out next year.”

As to what this car will be, well, it’s only speculation, but Rivian officials have stated that they intend to stay away from other genres like sports cars, so another EV truck is likely.

Why the EV tax credit ending is having such an impact

With experts predicting a sharp fall-off in new electric car purchases, some brands like Ford and GM have extended an olive branch to buyers by offering their own discounts for three months.

Others have built an olive tree and made their own five-year tax credit lines.

But others haven’t been able to afford that, and it’s having a knock-on effect amid the possible insurgency of Chinese EVs.

Tesla has already released a ‘Standard’ Model 3 and Model Y, and now Rivian is following suit.

What this means is that brands are looking to make more affordable cars, but at the expense of some of the gadgets you might be used to.

The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries.
In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.
“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler.
The GROW Grant will provide critical resources to strengthen these programs, expand access to Registered Apprenticeship pathways, enhance hands-on-learning, and build stronger partnerships with employers.","LOWELL — The Healey-Driscoll Administration today announced $2.1 million in Grants for Registered Apprenticeship Opportunities in Workforce (GROW) to 34 organizations to train and place more than 300 apprentices and pre-apprentices across the state. The grants, which include contract renewals and new awards, leverage nearly $2 million in state funding complemented by support from federal funds to train apprentices in high growth industries like health care, manufacturing, clean energy, and life sciences.

Registered Apprenticeship provides individuals with paid work experience including classroom instruction and on-the-job training combined with securing nationally recognized credentials, progressive wage increases, and economic mobility and advancement.

Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones made the announcement at Middlesex Community College in Lowell, Massachusetts. Among grantees, Middlesex Community College received $125,000 to launch a Surgical Technology registered apprenticeship program.

“The GROW grants are an effective way to expand Registered Apprenticeship opportunities that connect people to good jobs and help build a skilled workforce,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Through these investments, our administration is helping more residents access pathways into growing industries while supporting employers who are ready to train and hire.”

“These GROW grants strengthen local and regional partnerships that help employers build a skilled workforce specific to their needs,” said Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll. “By supporting registered apprenticeship programs in industries like health care, advanced manufacturing, early education, and IT, we’re creating more opportunities for Massachusetts residents to earn, learn, and advance their careers.”

The Division of Apprentice Standards (DAS) within the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD) administers the Commonwealth’s Registered Apprenticeship Programs. DAS serves more than 500 active programs with more than 10,000 active apprentices. Construction and building trades apprenticeships comprise the majority of programs with nearly a quarter of registered apprentices represented by expansion industries such as health care, education and manufacturing.

“Expanding and growing Registered Apprenticeship in the Massachusetts is an important part of our workforce agenda,” said Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones. “The GROW awards are part of the administration’s efforts to build workforce pipelines in our in-demand industries while increasing access and opportunity for our residents to pursue a career, gain industry-recognized credentials, and secure meaningful wages and benefits.”

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is committed to expanding apprenticeship. The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries. In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.

“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler. “Whether it’s a career in the building trades, health care, IT, manufacturing, clean energy, or education, there’s a registered apprenticeship program for that. We look forward to working with all partners to support even more apprenticeship opportunities.”

“We are so excited to work with this group of thirty-four sponsors across the Commonwealth who see the immense potential of Registered Apprenticeship to support their workforce development needs,” said Director of the Division of Apprentice Standards Lara Thomas. “Apprenticeship changes lives, and we are honored to be able to provide this support and partner with these employers.”

A ""squirrel"" earned its acorns as the device was used by an Indiana Michigan Power linesman to show what happens when the pesky rodents short out a transformer that makes customers lose power. The result was a jarring boom that resounded throughout the coliseum's Expo Center.

At REMC's display, two students competed by using 15-foot insulated poles while wearing insulated gloves to touch an area on a simulated power pole, which stopped a timer.

""We're giving them a little bit of an experience of what it's like to be a lineman, like a storm restoration or a power outage,"" Chris Todd, director of marketing and communications for Northeastern REMC, based in Whitley County.

It gives the students an inside look and appreciation of what it's like for linemen to work on weekends and evenings when a power outage occurs.

Jhon Estevez, a design tech in engineering at Indiana Michigan Power, said he wanted to show students that I&M has more jobs than just lineman.

""When you think about a power company, you think electricity, that's all you're gonna do,"" he said. ""But there's people in the background who actually have to design stuff, and never ever come into contact with electricity.""

Estevez said he came to the company as a mechanical engineer with no degrees dealing with electricity.

Whether is was games with robotic ""dogs,"" seeing a pig ultrasound, or getting their hair braided, each table had something to get students' interest sparked in a career. Bowen Health had students don dark glasses and try to negotiate a path lined with plastic cones with a walker at the dementia empathy obstacle course.

At SDI's booth, students donned virtual reality headsets.

""Mostly they're seeing our melt shop,"" said Robb Stiver, rebar supervisor for SDI's Columbia City location. ""the demonstration where we take the electrical sticks and melt down the steel, 3,000 degrees.""

Columbia City makes flat-rolled steel. The Fort Wayne-based company also makes rebar, rails and many other products.

The third-quarter adjusted loss was 65 cents a share, the company said in a letter to shareholders. That’s better than the 71-cent average deficit expected by analysts. Rivian slashed automotive cost of revenue by nearly $19,000 on a per-vehicle basis year over year, according to the letter.

Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe is pushing to control expenses and corral years of losses as it prepares to launch a new midsized R2 SUV next year. The model is critical for Rivian’s goal to boost sales volumes and achieve profitability in the future. Rivian said it’s on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026.

The company also said it set up a new company this month called Mind Robotics, focused on the advancement of AI-enabled robotics in industrial applications. The new venture secured about $110 million in external seed capital.

Rivan had already trimmed its vehicle-sales outlook twice this year and warned of mounting losses. The company has also seen higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs while the elimination of policies supporting EV adoption have hurt revenue.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” the company said in the letter.

The electric vehicle maker expects its third-quarter delivery performance to be its best of the year.

Rivian posted third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

Rivian Automotive posted revenue that narrowly topped analysts' expectations, after expiring electric-vehicle tax credits helped boost sales.

The company's revenue hit $1.56 billion for the September quarter, narrowly beating the $1.51 billion expected by analysts. That also marked a 78% increase relative to a year before.

Rivian (RIVN) said its software and services division brought in $416 million revenue, a 324% increase compared to a year earlier, primarily reflecting contributions from services that the company didn't perform in the year-prior period.

Automotive revenue came in at $1.14 million, above estimates that called for $1.08 billion. That was driven by the sale of 13,201 electric trucks and SUVs for the September quarter, a number the company reported a month ago. At the time, that figure came in below analysts' expectations, but Rivian noted Tuesday that the third quarter's delivery performance will likely be the strongest of the year.

Rivian shares fell by more than 5% on Tuesday before the market closed, but rose by almost 4% in the extended session after earnings were reported.

Sales are expected to slow across the EV industry in the current quarter, after consumers pulled ahead their purchases to take advantage of tax credits that expired in September. Rivian, which makes vehicles that start at more than $70,000, is expected to sell about 10,000 EVs next quarter, down from the more than 14,000 it delivered a year earlier.

The company maintained its full-year sales guidance of between 41,500 and 43,500 EVs, which it announced in August. Initially, Rivian had expected deliveries of between 40,000 and 46,000 units. Last year, it sold close to 52,000 vehicles.

But Rivian expects its sales performance to improve next year with the launch of the R2, a more mass-market friendly mid-size crossover that's expected to start at $45,000. The company said Tuesday that deliveries are on track to begin in the first half of next year.

""In Q3, we continued to make significant progress across our strategic priorities which includes R2 and our technology roadmap,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""Over the long term, we believe the automotive industry will be fully electric, autonomous and software-defined.""

Rivian generated a positive gross profit in the September quarter after failing to do so in the June quarter.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 17:18:40.814328

Indigenous housing: Budget 2025 commits to addressing the unique and persistent housing and infrastructure challenges facing Indigenous communities.","OTTAWA — Rick Smith, President of the Canadian Climate Institute, made the following statement in response to the federal government’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy outlined in Budget 2025:

“The global economic activity generated by decarbonization is one of the greatest opportunities of this century. Canada’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy, announced by the federal government today, is a good first step toward ensuring Canada can succeed in this context. If Canada aims to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade, it will be critical to increase trade with Europe, Asia, and the Americas—all of which continue to take strong action to accelerate the shift to renewables, electric vehicles, and other low-carbon electric technologies.

“The budget proposes actions and delivery timelines to bolster Canada’s climate competitiveness—especially on core policies such as industrial carbon pricing, stronger methane regulations, sustainable investment guidelines, and tax credits for expanding clean electricity. We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure these essential policies result in more abundant and affordable energy, attract new investment to Canadian industries, support more well-paying jobs and economic growth across the country, and help make communities more secure and resilient.

“Swift implementation of climate competitiveness priorities will define how Canada succeeds or fails. In the absence of some remaining details, policy uncertainty persists, undermining Canadian firms’ ability to attract investment.”

KEY POLICY DETAILS

For the last six months, the Climate Institute has emphasized the importance of several climate and competitiveness priorities. This budget addresses each of them, with varying levels of detail:

Industrial carbon pricing:

Modernizing industrial carbon pricing remains one of the most important things the federal government can do to reduce emissions while keeping costs low for businesses and having virtually no impact on the cost of living. Doing so requires fixing problems with provincial carbon credit markets, and creating certainty around carbon markets beyond 2030 so that businesses can make big investments in low-carbon projects.

Critically, Budget 2025 makes a clear commitment to bring more certainty to industrial carbon pricing. It commits to fixing the federal benchmark (which defines minimum standards for provincial systems), improving the federal backstop (which will be decisively applied in jurisdictions that do not meet the benchmark), and developing a long-term price trajectory. The details and specifics of these changes will make or break this policy’s effectiveness, both for the climate and competitiveness. We look forward to contributing to the government’s efforts to improve this critical policy tool.

Methane regulations for oil and gas:

We support the government’s commitment to finalize enhanced rules to reduce methane emissions for the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas emissions remain a barrier to Canada’s overall climate progress and make up nearly a third of the country’s greenhouse gases. Stronger rules to reduce methane pollution would build on an impressive record of success in provinces like B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan, and create new opportunities for Canadian companies that have been leaders in commercializing technologies to manage methane. And methane represents some of the lowest-cost emissions reductions available.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit:

Budget 2025 explicitly recognizes the importance of dramatically increasing investment into Canada’s electricity system, and commits to introduce legislation soon implementing the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit to support provinces in upgrading and expanding their electricity grids, as well as enhancements to existing tax credits. We also support the decision to maintain the federal Clean Electricity Regulations, which will help accelerate the transition to clean, reliable power. Low-carbon electricity is already a major Canadian competitive advantage, and making sure electricity remains abundant and affordable will be essential for future competitiveness as demand continues to grow.

Climate Investment Taxonomy:

Importantly, the Budget recommits Canada to finalizing anational climate investment taxonomy (referred to as “Made-in Canada Sustainable Investment Guildelines”) for the financial sector by the end of 2026. The voluntary guidelines will provide much-need criteria to help investors evaluate material risks and opportunities from transition. Budget 2025 also notes the government’s intention to explore a Sustainable Bond Framework in support of issuing both green and transition bonds to be aligned with a Canadian taxonomy, further mobilizing investment to support the transition.

Electric Vehicle Availability Standard:

While Budget 2025 notes that the national Electric Vehicle Availability Standard is currently under review, we urge the federal government to maintain the core elements of the policy, to help increase Canadians’ access to high-quality, lower-cost electric vehicles. The federal government should follow through on its commitment to bring clarity and transparency to any change to the policy within the following weeks.

Resilient communities and infrastructure:

Budget 2025 makes little mention of how the federal government will support provinces and communities in making infrastructure more resilient to climate-fueled extreme weather. Investing in adaptation is not a ‘nice to have’—upgrading infrastructure for current and future extreme weather will be crucial to saving billions of dollars in costs from disrupted trade and other economic impacts, and should be a key component of any climate competitiveness strategy.

In particular, the announcement of $51 billion for a new Build Communities Strong Fund should be carefully designed to ensure that projects funded through this program do not make Canada more vulnerable to climate change. Funded projects should both strengthen resilience by building infrastructure that can withstand a harsher and more volatile climate, and avoid encouraging new development in areas that are—or will become—unsafe from threats such as flooding and wildfire.

Critical minerals:

Budget 2025 explicitly tackles some of the concerns the Climate Institute raised in our report, Critical Path, which called for policy to de-risk investment in Canadian critical minerals projects. The Budget responds to this concern by committing $2 billion dollars in a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Wealth Fund to make strategic investments in critical mineral projects and companies. This approach, if well-implemented, will unlock private investment in Canadian projects to help seize a growing opportunity in the global energy transition, while also protecting the economic security of Canadian electrification supply chains.

Indigenous housing:

Budget 2025 commits to addressing the unique and persistent housing and infrastructure challenges facing Indigenous communities. It commits to work with Indigenous leadership in developing Build Canada Homes to ensure it meets First Nations, Inuit, and Métis identified needs and priorities. It also confirms $2.8 billion for urban, rural, and northern Indigenous housing as well as an increase in the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s target for investments in Indigenous infrastructure from at least $1 billion to at least $3 billion. As it implements these changes, the federal government should work to link these actions with both reconciliation and climate objectives.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

Emissions

China emits over 30% of global greenhouse gases—an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60% of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70% of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10% by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30% from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

—Renewable goals—

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30% by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36% in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles,"" which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40% of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signaled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic meters, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

,Detroit Environment,2025-11-04 21:39:44+00:00,The Hill,"Companies hit the brakes on EVs, laying off thousands of workers",Rachel Frazin,,,,,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5589084-evs-electric-vehicles-tax-credits-layoffs-gm-cox-rivian/amp/,"In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.
The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:57:44.508347

The deal structure also provides an option to Entergy to expand delivery capacity in the region to meet future energy demand and demonstrates both companies’ long-term commitment to meeting the region’s growing energy needs.

The natural gas supplied through this agreement, already in Entergy’s financial plan, will help fuel Entergy Louisiana’s combined-cycle combustion turbine facilities, which are being developed to provide efficient, cleaner energy for the company’s customers and to support projects like Meta’s new hyperscale data center in Richland Parish.

The project includes expanding Energy Transfer’s Tiger Pipeline with the construction of a 12-mile lateral with a capacity of up to 1 Bcf/d. Natural gas supply for this project will be sourced from Energy Transfer’s extensive pipeline network which is connected to all the major producing basins in the U.S.

“This agreement is another example of how we’re making smart, long-term investments to ensure reliable, affordable power for our customers while supporting major economic development projects across our state,” said Phillip May, president and CEO of Entergy Louisiana. “Working with partners like Energy Transfer allows us to secure the fuel supply needed to power critical facilities like the ones in northern Louisiana and support our state’s growth for decades to come.”

Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs.
The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills.
And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices.
“It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said.","Molly Mandel is on a budget. Like many others her age, the 77-year-old retiree depends on her Social Security check and a small monthly pension to cover her expenses. She only buys food that’s on sale at the grocery store. She thrifts her clothes because the prices at department stores are too high these days. “You go into Penney’s, and you look at a blouse, and it’s 24.99!” she said.

But despite all her penny-pinching, her spending is still more than she sees in her monthly checks. “I’m economizing in as many places as I can, but the inflation of almost everything I use is outpacing my income,” she said.

Now her electricity provider, Arizona Public Service, is proposing to raise her electricity bills for the third time in three years. So when the opportunity came to speak at a town hall on the potential rate hike in Sun City, a retirement community north of Phoenix, she was one of the first to share the way rising costs were already impacting her tight budgeting.

Sitting at a roundtable near the front of the room, she spoke directly to the state attorney general, Kris Mayes, who convened the meeting. “I am a retiree who lives on Social Security and a small pension, and with increases in the Medicare costs that are deducted from Social Security, the food costs, and tariff costs for almost every product brought into the United States, an increase of 16 percent seems outrageous to me,” she said.

She was one of around 40 people who had shown up to the meeting, the first in a series of town halls organized by the attorney general, after the state’s largest electricity providers announced potential rate hikes.

‘The new eggs’

For people across the country, rates are going up at a fast clip, with some experts now calling electricity “the new eggs.”

Over the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation. And residents in 41 states are looking at even higher costs for electricity and natural gas due to proposed rate hikes this year and next, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank.

In some states, like Arizona, the increases have been particularly stark. As Mayes noted at the town hall, “The cost of electricity in Arizona has risen faster in the past two years than in the previous nine.” The latest request would raise residential bills by an estimated $240 a year.

For Arizonans, the price increase is on top of the already skyrocketing bills residents are paying in the summertime due to extreme heat, which continues to worsen from climate change.

Utilities have various reasons for raising their rates. In Arizona, for example, an explosion of data centers is leading to a skyrocketing demand for electricity. Extreme weather, like heat and wildfires, is also straining the grid, and the need to upgrade existing infrastructure like transmission lines is raising costs for utilities.

But many utilities are also for-profit entities. Arizona Public Service, one of two utilities asking for rate increases, made a net profit of $608 million in 2024, after raising rates 8 percent last year and the year before.

The CEO of APS, Ted Geiser, has said the rate hikes are necessary to pay for needed upgrades to infrastructure and that the new rate proposal also includes a new way to charge large electricity consumers like data centers to pay for the strain they are putting on the system.

But Mayes, who formerly served on the Arizona Corporation Commission, the body responsible for approving rate hikes, is intervening in this rate case in the hopes of stopping the hike. She thinks it’s obvious that the consecutive hikes are a sign that residents are shouldering some of the cost. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” she told The 19th in an interview. “I’ve been watching utilities for 25 years. I was a utility regulator, and I’ve never seen a situation like this where such incredibly profitable companies are asking residential consumers to subsidize their electricity costs.”

“Enough is enough,” she continued. “Arizonans can’t afford these rate increases anymore and the utility shouldn’t be trying to foist them on people that are already struggling.”

Who is impacted

At 77, Mandel is emblematic of the people who stand to be hit disproportionately by the rising costs: older women.

This demographic is typically living on a fixed income with less in retirement savings and Social Security benefits than men. Women over 65 are also more likely to be living in poverty than men of the same age.

Those realities are translating to worries over how to make ends meet. According to an April poll by the AARP of adults 50 and older, women were more likely to say they were concerned about their electricity bills going up over men, with 50% of women saying they were very concerned compared to 35% of men.

“High energy costs can lead to older adults having to make difficult decisions between paying for heating, cooling, medication, or food,” said Jenn Jones, vice president of financial security and livable communities at AARP, in an email. “The bottom line is stable, affordable energy helps ensure people’s safety, comfort, and health — particularly during extreme weather.”

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

The elderly are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They have a harder time regulating their body temperature, making them more susceptible to heat illness, which is becoming more common due to rising temperatures.

“We’ve had multiple heat-related deaths in Arizona, and one of the reasons I am being so aggressive in these rate cases is because I am very worried that more and more folks are going to feel like they have to turn their AC off so that they can afford their bills,” said Mayes, who is currently investigating the death of an 82-year old woman who died in Sun City in May after her electricity was shut off due to failure to pay her bills.

While there are no nationwide studies on electricity burden that focus on gender and age, in August, the Gender Equity Policy Institute published a California-specific analysis, finding that women are hit hardest by rising energy costs in the state. It also found that senior women — or those 65 and older, were most likely to be energy-burdened — more than senior men and younger adults of any gender. Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs. The report also found that in California, the energy burden is worse for Black women and Native women.

The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills. “A lot of this goes back to the gendered inequalities that women have experienced over their whole life. They on average or more likely to have earned lower wages and accumulated less wealth. And women live longer than men,” said Nancy Cohen, founder and CEO of the institute, and author on the report. “It is understandable and pretty much predictable that senior women would experience this difficulty.”

The report also found that 31% of women-led households were energy burdened compared to 24% of men-led households and that 37% of families headed by single mothers are energy burdened compared to 28% headed by single mothers.

Trump policies

At the same time that rates are going up, policies that could make bills go down are being upended by the Trump administration. Funding to bring more clean energy into the mix, which has consistently gotten cheaper, has been gutted. Energy efficiency standards, which ultimately help consumers save money by incentivizing appliances that use less electricity, have also been rolled back.

And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices. According to an analysis by Princeton University, the legislation, which repeals clean energy tax credits and rescinds funding for renewables, is expected to increase electricity costs by $165 a year by 2030, and up to $280 a year by 2035.

And now due to the government shutdown, the Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program, one of the few that helps low-income Americans pay their energy bills, and that prioritizes the elderly, the disabled and those with young children, is in limbo, with funding delayed.

Usually states would have received their allocation by late October or early November – 80% of which is distributed for heating costs. Now, the best estimate by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state directors of the program, says that funding won’t come until December at the earliest.

According to the organization, the cost of heating a home is expected to increase by 8 percent this year, largely due to the increase in electricity prices, making the dispersal of money even more urgent.

As a result, the organization is asking utilities to voluntarily pause shutoffs for customers who don’t pay their bills. “No family should be forced to choose between heat and food because of a federal funding delay,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, in a news release. “Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again.”

Competing costs

For older people it’s not just electricity that’s rising; health care costs are going up as well.

Margaret Mohr, a 62-year-old who also was in attendance at the Sun City town hall, is facing $800 a month premiums on her health insurance; she is not old enough to qualify for Medicare. She works part time as a licensed counselor, a job she had wanted to transition to long before she retired from law enforcement, but now it’s become the way she can afford her rising costs. “Everything goes up except income,” she said.

Even for those on Medicare like Mandel, costs are also going up. Her premiums are rising by $21 a month, a cost that eats up the recently announced cost of living increase to Social Security. Mandel also worries about the price of medications. She just got a proposal from Cigna, her healthcare provider, which would require her to cover a higher percentage of the cost of certain prescription drugs.

Mandel considers herself lucky. She owns her home and has some resources she can draw from if forced to. But she worries about people she knows who have no financial buffer at all. “It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said. “Even if you have additional assets they are depleting those the longer you live.”

She herself worries she might have to relocate. “I might have to downsize, or consider moving outside the country,” she said. “But because I have so much family here I don’t know if I want to make that drastic move.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/electricity-meter.png,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:42.716035

Swtch Energy, a Toronto-based company that provides EV charging ports for multifamily and other commercial buildings, conducted a survey in September 2024 that revealed 82 percent of North America multifamily residents lack home access to EV charging, said Carter Li, SWTCH’s CEO and founder.

“We found that multifamily residents are two and a half times more likely to own an EV if they have charging access in their buildings,” Li said. “Furthermore, they would actually pay $50 to $100 more per month for their apartment if they had access to charging in these locations. But there’s a relative abundance of what we call, ‘garage orphans,’ who don’t have access to charging where they work and live.”

Swtch has seen an increase in how many buildings have EV charging, said Li.

“I think we did a survey two or three years ago and it was 6 percent of the multifamily buildings that had access to EV charging in North America,” but he now estimates that 13 to 14 percent of buildings are currently equipped with the necessary technology.

Founded in 2016, Swtch was created when Li realized his own challenges in owning an EV where he lived in Downtown Toronto.

“The technology, the business model, everything was designed around: How do you put in charging in multifamily buildings in Downtown Toronto?” he recalled. Since then, EV adoption in Canada and the U.S. has been similar: about 10 percent of new vehicle sales. Swtch’s business is primarily U.S.-based, with a significant presence in the Northeast and California, said Li.

The growth in EV ownership, despite periods of political opposition to subsidies in the U.S. and Canada, has been a net positive.

“The rate of increase might plateau a little bit, but there’s this consistent overall increase in EV adoption,” said Li. “There might be states and provinces across North America that have higher rates of adoption due to state or provincial policies, but irrespective of that, the general trend, with or without policies, is still increasing. It’s just how quickly it’s increasing.”

EV ownership and the subsequent demand for residential charging ports is particularly strong in California, Florida and Texas, said Olga Shevorenkova, CEO of Loop Global, a Los Angeles-based company that integrates EV charging hardware and software services into residential and other commercial buildings.

“We’re seeing that multifamily is one segment where demand continues strong, because a lot of tenants would not move into the building if there is no EV charger,” said Shevorenkova. “And that’s not just California. That goes across the country.” Founded in 2019, Loop Global has about 7,000 ports — approximately 6,000 in multifamily and under 1,000 in single-family homes — across 30 states, Shevorenkova said.

As far as demand for EVs, Shevorenkova doesn’t see Trump administration cuts to EV subsidies as being a huge negative — in particular, specific cuts to certain charging portals.

“Federal subsidies, which Trump canceled or nearly canceled, were designed to support corridor charging,” she said, meaning highway charging stations. “Those fast chargers are built alongside corridors to eliminate the range anxiety of a lot of people who buy these vehicles.

But we’re not playing in that market. So that particular federal subsidy affected a lot of companies, but not ours.

“The multifamily segments still have state, municipal and utility subsidies and rebates. Those didn’t go away. Despite federal subsidy cuts, state and municipal subsidies remain strong.”

Consistent demand from multifamily owners is a big plus to providers such as Loop Global, as real estate investment trusts that own many apartment buildings look to spread good practices throughout their portfolios, said Shevorenkova.

“If you’ve done a good job for them in a few buildings, they continue to do business with you,” she said. “And it’s a very agile way to grow your revenues and adoption, versus going and knocking on every building’s door. You’re not working with a corporate structure who pushes down your solution on individual buildings.”

Loop Global’s technology, too, can work with charging stations in underground concrete multifamily garages.

“The garages have very bad reception on a cellular site, and the chargers are smart devices for 21st-century infrastructure,” she said. “They don’t work without a connection to the internet. You need the internet for billing, reporting and connectivity for the car to send the signal to the charger, and so on and so forth.”

Tapping into a building’s WiFi is a bad solution, because security wouldn’t allow it, she continued. So, Loop Global developed what it calls network access packages and connectivity infrastructure to create a local Wi-Fi network that connects all the chargers and allows for local load management.

In addition, later this year, the company plans to bring to market what it calls Infinity Link, a Bluetooth-based technology that allows the charger to go offline if there is a grid outage and then connect back to the network.

Shevorenkova also noted growing investor interest in profitability over rapid growth for EV charging companies.

“The era of, ‘I’m going to grow at any cost,’ is over,” she said. “Investors only want to invest in companies which have either reached profitability, which not that many have done or maybe no one has done. An EV charging company must have a very clear path and strategy towards getting there. We have two fantastic investors, Fifth Wall and Agility, which is a large Middle Eastern group.”

Swtch’s Li said installing EV charging ports in a single-family home is far easier than in multifamily.

“Single-family is growing for sure, because they require less of what we call managed charging,” said Li. “It’s relatively easy to put a charger in a single-family home. You just hook it up to your electrical panel and it gets included as part of your monthly electrical bill. It’s when you’re dealing with complex common shared amenities and assets that it becomes really complicated in multifamily or commercial buildings.

“People who own and operate these EV charging assets — what they call charge point operators — raise money and go in there and own and operate. So it’s a zero capex model for the people the site hosts. They don’t have to necessarily put any skin in the game.”

A firm like Swtch is different, Li said.

“We are taking on the risks because we believe in the business model, and we’ve done all the math, and everything that we understand pencils,” he said. “So this has been a much easier way for people who still want to provide the amenity for their residents and tenants, but don’t quite understand the ecosystem, don’t really understand the risks involved. We do this day in and day out to be able to take on that risk and to deploy these assets in these locations.”

Aubrey Gunnels, CEO and co-founder at 3V Infrastructure, a Manhattan-based EV charging infrastructure investor, owner and operator, said in an email that her company is tackling the challenges of single-family and multifamily installations.

“Historically, it’s been easier to own an EV if you lived in a single-family home and could install charging yourself,” said Gunnels. “We’re trying to change that at 3V Infrastructure by removing the cost and burden for property owners to offer charging to their residents. 3V Infrastructure is one of the only companies addressing the market gap in infrastructure dollars to build chargers in multifamily buildings. This removes the financial and operational barriers for property owners to offer charging as an amenity to their residents.

“As EV adoption increases, more residents expect at-home charging, and they’re willing to pay more in rent for it.”

Gunnels cited a recent survey from multifamily ownership giant Greystar. It showed that residents were willing to pay $66 a month for EV charging — and won’t rent without it.

“Even if EV penetration peaks at 20 percent, that’s still 20 percent of building residents who will expect access to charging,” she said. “Multifamily property owners can’t ignore that.”",https://commercialobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/EV-charging-RF-GettyImages-2164056823-WEB.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:24.692291

Mike Lawler (NY-17), Don Beyer (VA-08), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01) introduced the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act, bipartisan legislation to improve soil health on farms and support sustainable alternatives to annual agriculture. The legislation would ensure United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) conservation programs are better able to support farmers who incorporate perennial systems and agroforestry into their operations.

“By supporting farmers in the utilization of perennial systems and agroforestry, the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act encourages healthy soil management – improving overall farm productivity and stimulating microbial life,” said Congressman Lawler. “This is a win for farmers, a win for the environment, and a win for American families. I’m proud to join my colleagues Don Beyer and Chellie Pingree in introducing this commonsense bipartisan bill.”

“American agriculture faces many challenges today, including harmful soil erosion exacerbated by the climate crisis’ extreme weather patterns,” said Congressman Beyer. “Our bill is a significant step to support the health and sustainability of American farms by ensuring the USDA has the resources necessary to be a strong partner for farmers who prioritize perennial agriculture and agroforestry. These practices promote soil health, which not only makes the soil more resilient to extreme weather events and erosion but also improves long-term agricultural productivity and farming’s impacts on watersheds and wildlife.”

“In Maine and across the country, farmers are on the frontlines of the climate crisis – dealing with severe drought, flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions,” said Congresswoman Pingree. “In order to make our food system more resilient and to ensure our agricultural producers survive the worsening climate crisis, we must encourage and invest in climate-smart practices. My Representatives Beyer and Lawler’s Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act does just that – promoting soil health, investing in agroforestry research and development, and incentivizing greenhouse gas reduction. Our bipartisan, commonsense bill is a win-win.”

""The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act provides common-sense, straight-forward support for high-impact perennial practices through NRCS conservation programs. It also ensures increased technical capacity at USDA for new and exciting perennial practices through a series of agroforestry centers,” said National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition Conservation Specialist Jesse Womack. “This bill is a win for farmers committed to building soil health across their operation through plant diversity and strong, living roots.”

“Perennial and agroforestry systems strengthen soils by minimizing disturbance, maximizing living roots, and bolstering land-based carbon sinks – all while delivering benefits across biodiversity, on-farm resilience, and producer bottom lines,” said Interim Director of Policy at Carbon180 Mary Olive. “The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act of 2025 enhances NRCS conservation programs to increase support and flexibility for US farmers and ranchers looking to implement these innovative, soil-friendly production systems. We applaud Representatives Beyer, Lawler, and Pingree for their leadership in prioritizing soil health.”

At the Battery Show North America in early October in Detroit, the Fraunhofer IWU and the automotive supplier Amsted Automotive presented an integrally designed battery housing with aluminum foam sandwiches. This is a special material structure consisting of two solid aluminum sheets enclosing an inner core of aluminum foam. Such housings can, if needed, incorporate a cooling structure or a thermal storage medium known as Phase Change Material (PCM), which stores or releases heat as it changes between solid and liquid states.

Fraunhofer IWU has successfully integrated PCM into closed-cell aluminum foam. PCM can absorb or release large amounts of thermal energy while changing its state (solid to liquid or vice versa) without significantly altering its own temperature. This makes them particularly well-suited for efficient thermal management in lithium-ion batteries.

The demonstrator presented in Detroit shows a wide range of possible serial solutions. Depending on the prioritized properties, pure AAS (Aluminum-Aluminum Foam Sandwiches), AAS with infiltrated PCM, AAS with a cooling structure, or AAS with a cooling structure and PCM can be implemented.

To ensure that battery housings made from aluminum foam are also used in mass-produced vehicles, researchers led by Dr. Thomas Hipke and Dr. Rico Schmerler are now focusing more on cost-effectiveness. A key factor in determining future manufacturing prices is the cost of raw materials. Hipke states: ""We are increasingly using recycled material to produce the aluminum foam. Not only is this significantly more cost-effective, but it also greatly reduces the CO2 footprint.""

Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased.

Additionally, Oklahoma Energy investors track this Texas surge because regional transmission expansion pressures cross-state planning models.

In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state’s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years.

Therefore, peak load trendlines now drive new investor assumptions on future infrastructure scale.

Fastest demand growth among U.S. grids

Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growth among U.S. electricity grids between 2024 and 2025.

Also, analysts continue to treat ERCOT load as the leading indicator benchmark.

From January through September 2025, demand for electric power in ERCOT increased 5% compared with the same period in 2024 to 372 terawatthours (TWh), 23% more than the same months in 2021.

Finally, this type of sustained sequential comp growth rarely appears in modern grid cycles.

Since 2023, wind and solar generation, especially utility-scale solar, have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in ERCOT and are increasingly meeting rising demand.

Therefore, this structural shift restricts natural gas mid-day market share.

Wind and solar scaling in ERCOT

Utility-scale solar generated 45 TWh of electricity in the first nine months of 2025, 50% more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021, when utility-scale solar only produced 11 TWh.

Additionally, utility-scale solar is showing the steepest absolute lift across the entire U.S. grid fleet.

Wind generation through the first nine months of this year totaled 87 TWh, up 4% compared with the same period in 2024 and 36% since the same period in 2021.

Also, wind additions continue to support diversification across the Texas balancing mix.

Together, wind and solar generation met 36% of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of 2025.

Finally, this composite share shift highlights the new renewable-first pathway emerging within ERCOT economics.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook

Note: The other category includes nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, batteries, and other nonrenewable sources. ERCOT=Electric Reliability Council of Texas

Natural gas levels flatten

Natural gas-fired generation also increased after 2021 but flattened more recently.

Therefore, market share compression continues at the margin during primary daylight generation windows.

Natural gas-fired generation between January and September increased to 161 TWh in 2023, 24% more than the same period in 2021.

Also, this period helped establish the dominance baseline for comparison modeling.

Since 2023, natural gas-fired generation remained relatively flat, totaling 158 TWh between January and September 2025.

Meanwhile, capital rotation toward solar remains strong through ERCOT interconnection queues.

Although it is still the largest source of electricity for ERCOT, natural gas-fired generation averaged 43% in the first nine months of 2025, compared with 47% in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024.

Therefore, solar and wind scaling continue to shrink the mid-day thermal footprint.

Midday generation shift

The types of energy sources used for electricity generation can vary on an hourly basis, especially during the summer.

Also, Texas demand spikes often trigger short-term market dislocations.

Solar output is highest during midday hours, and the increased availability of solar generation in ERCOT in recent years has reduced the need for natural gas-fired generation during that time of the day.

Additionally, intraday flexibility remains the critical technical advantage.

Solar generators in ERCOT produced an average of 24 gigawatts (GW) between noon and 1:00 p.m. during the summer months of June through September compared with an average of 12 GW of solar generation at noon in the summer months of 2023.

Therefore, solar output doubling materially alters summer dispatch dynamics.

Over the same period, the share of natural gas-fired generation at midday fell from 50% in 2023 to 37% in 2025.

Finally, intraday displacement becomes central to market redesign forecasting.

Batteries emerging as a grid stabilizer

Batteries store electricity during daytime when generation from wind and solar is the highest, and they supply electricity when generation from wind and solar is declining.

Additionally, storage adds timing flexibility that directly strengthens ERCOT balancing authority.

Beginning in October 2024, ERCOT began reporting battery output separately in its hourly grid data.

Also, storage tracking now improves operational transparency for developers and investors.

In the summer months of 2025, batteries helped supply electricity in the evening as solar output declined, supplying an average of 4 GW in the 8:00 p.m. hour.

Therefore, battery deployment is now considered a major competitive reliability lever.

Forward forecast

ERCOT’s electricity demand is forecast to grow faster than that of any other grid operator in the United States through at least 2026.

Additionally, analysts across Oklahoma Energy markets now price this load trend as a baseline assumption.

In our October Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast demand will rise another 14% in the first nine months of 2026 compared with the same period this year, reaching 425 TWh.

Governor Whitmer Signs Bipartisan Bills to Protect Michigan’s Environment, Supporting Clean Water, Air, and Land Across the State

Other bills include lowering costs for Michigan National Guard members and cutting red tape for local governments

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill to lower costs for Michigan National Guard members. Last month, she signed six bipartisan bills to implement the budget. These bills secured resources to support local parks and recreation projects across the state, bolstered conservation programs and protected Michigan’s land, air, and water, and cut red tape for local governments. Including today’s legislation, Governor Whitmer has signed a record 1,531 bipartisan bills into law since taking office.

""Since I took office, I’ve been committed to protecting Michigan’s environment, ensuring generations of Michiganders can explore and enjoy all our state has to offer,” said Governor Whitmer. “That’s why I’m proud to sign these seven bills into law so our departments have enough funding and support to continue programs that protect Michigan’s water, air, and land. Whether it’s maintaining a supply of clean drinking water or creating new trails in our parks, I’ll keep working with anyone to protect and defend our environment. Together, let’s get it done.”

“We must all work hard to protect the natural resources we are blessed to steward,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “These bills will ensure Michigan can continue to conserve natural resources and protect water, air, and land across our state. We’re also making a difference for the National Guard members who step up for our state each and every day. Let’s keep working together to build a bright future for Michigan families.”

House Bill 4962, sponsored by state Representative Ron Robinson (R-Utica), supports Michigan’s National Guard members by establishing a Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund to put more money back in servicemembers’ pockets. Specifically, the fund will help Michigan National Guard members afford childcare, health care, and tuition. The fund ensures servicemembers and their families have the support they need to make it in Michigan. HB 4962 will not take effect immediately, as the tie-barred bills have not been passed out of the legislature.

House Bill 4392, sponsored by state Representative Ken Borton (R-Gaylord), protects Michigan’s environment by allocating $41.8 million from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund for 85 projects across the state. Specifically, the projects conserve natural resources and develop land to support public recreation, conservation, and accessibility. This includes protecting wildlife habitats, building new trails, improvements to parks, and more.

Senate Bill 273, sponsored by state Senator Kevin Daley (R-Lum), supports environmental conservation efforts by continuing water quality protection fees. The fees were set to expire in 2025 but have been extended through fiscal year 2029. The money collected from the fees funds environmental and conservation efforts run by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Senate Bill 574, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), amends the tobacco settlement fund allocations and helps to increase the Michigan Merit Award Trust Fund, supporting scholarships, tuition assistance programs, nursing scholarships, and other related expenses.

Senate Bill 577, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), ensures Michiganders continue to have clean drinking water across the state. Specifically, the bill extends the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy authority to charge fees for training and certifying people who operate public water systems. The fees help fund important programs that train and certify water operators, support emergency responses to drinking water threats, and monitor and protect Michigan’s water quality. Overall, this bill generates around $600,000 per year in funding for these programs.

Senate Bill 579, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), protects Michigan’s environment by allowing the state of Michigan to continue collecting certain environmental fees. The fees are paid by individuals, businesses, or governments when they apply for permits to build near bodies of water, discharge water into storm drains or rivers, handle hazardous waste, or get certified to operate wastewater or stormwater systems. The fees help fund important programs that protect Michigan’s environment. Overall, this bill delivers $7.6 million a year for environmental protection programs.

The roots of controlled environment certification trace back to the mid-20th century, when clean air and contamination control became essential to aerospace, defense, and nascent semiconductor manufacturing. A watershed moment arrived in 1960, when engineer Willis Whitfield introduced the modern laminar-flow cleanroom—technology that revolutionized contamination control by sweeping particles away from sensitive processes. As cleanrooms expanded across industries, the need for standardized testing grew, giving rise to methods for measuring particulates, verifying filter performance, and documenting airflow behavior.

In the following decades, international consensus matured. The ISO 14644 series (first published in 1999) provided a common language for cleanroom classification and testing. In healthcare, sterile compounding and aseptic processing accelerated demand for qualified facilities. Regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized contamination-control strategy, aseptic behavior, and the importance of robust, defensible data—work that certifiers enable through routine testing and thorough reporting.

As the field professionalized, certifiers organized around shared practices, mentorship, and credentialing. CETA (Controlled Environment Testing Association) brought together field certifiers, manufacturers, and laboratories to exchange methods, refine procedures, and champion excellence.

Texans are heading to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of 17 proposed amendments to the state Constitution, fill vacancies in Congress and the state Senate, and vote on scores of local offices and bond measures.

The off-year election is set to draw only a fraction of the turnout seen in typical even-year elections for the presidency and Congress, even with major referendums on the ballot affecting taxes, water, criminal justice and other areas.

As the polls opened Tuesday, more than a million Texans had already cast their ballots during the 12-day early voting period, which ended last week.

Here are three of the biggest storylines to watch on Election Day.

18th Congressional District special election

Residents of Texas’ 18th Congressional District have waited months for a special election to fill out the remainder of Rep. Sylvester Turner’s term. Turner died in March, leaving the seat vacant.

But with 16 candidates in the race, Houstonians will likely need to wait longer, with nobody expected to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright. In that case, the race would head to a runoff early next year between the top two finishers Tuesday.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Councilmember Amanda Edwards, both Democrats, have led most public polling of the race. State Rep. Jolanda Jones, D-Houston, was delayed in announcing her campaign while the Legislature was in session earlier this year, but she is also expected to be competitive.

While the district is heavily Democratic — having voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of nearly 40 percentage points — vote splitting among Democrats could allow a Republican candidate to make the runoff. Carmen Montiel Maria, a former Republican nominee for the seat, has polled highest among Republicans.

The 18th District has served as a launchpad for several storied Black politicians, including former Reps. Barbara Jordan and Sheila Jackson Lee — and Tuesday’s election could be the starting point for a lengthy congressional career for the winner. But redistricting has scrambled the politics of the district, whose boundaries will shift significantly come the March primary, when voters will pick the nominees for a full two-year term starting in 2027. Neighboring Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, was drawn into the new version of the 18th District and has heavily hinted he plans to run there.

The district encompasses downtown Houston and — for now — several of the city’s historic neighborhoods, including Third Ward and parts of The Heights and Acres Homes. Under the new lines, much of the 18th will be shifted to the south and northeast parts of Harris County.

Senate District 9 special election

In North Texas, two Republicans and a Democrat are facing off in the special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock.

The winner of the special election — or any runoff election, if no candidate wins a majority of votes Tuesday — will serve out the rest of Hancock’s Senate term through the end of 2026. The seat has been vacant since Hancock resigned from the upper chamber in June.

The two Republican candidates vying to represent the solidly red district are conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss and former Southlake Mayor John Huffman. Both have touted their experience in conservative politics and pledged to focus on reducing property taxes. Wambsganss won most of the biggest Republican endorsements, including from President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Senate president who has stocked the chamber with political allies. Huffman, on the other hand, has raked in millions of dollars in contributions from casino magnate Miriam Adelson and her pro-gambling groups.

Meanwhile, Taylor Rehmet, a union leader, machinist and Air Force veteran, is running a long-shot bid as a Democrat and focusing his campaign on working class interests.

The district, which covers about half of Fort Worth and much of Tarrant County’s northern suburbs, voted for Trump by over 17 percentage points last year. If a Republican wins the seat, as expected, the 31-member state Senate will be made up of 19 Republicans and 11 Democrats, with another vacant seat in a dark-red district based in Conroe to be filled in May.

Constitutional amendments

Texas voters will decide whether to approve 17 proposed edits to the state’s Constitution, with major implications for property taxes, the state’s dwindling water supply and the rules governing its criminal justice system.

Most of the proposed amendments, which will be listed at the top of the ballot, seek to reduce taxes for various groups of Texas residents. Proposition 2 would prohibit the state from collecting taxes on money earned through capital assets like investments, real estate and valuable items. It would also end a franchise tax on business trusts.

Proposition 13 would increase the share of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools, from $100,000 to $140,000. A Tribune calculation shows that the owner of a typical Texas home, worth about $302,000 last year, would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes under the proposed change.

Proposition 4 asks voters to approve $20 billion over the next two decades for water projects mostly aimed at addressing aging pipes and infrastructure, developing new water sources and mitigating future floods.

Additionally, two measures could alter the state’s judicial system. Proposition 3 would require judges to deny bail to individuals accused of committing specific felonies, including murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child, if the state demonstrates that doing so is necessary to ensure public safety or the defendant’s appearance in court.

And Proposition 12 would shake up the composition of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, a 13-member oversight group that investigates judicial misconduct. The commission is currently made up of six judges appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas and five citizens appointed by the governor. If Proposition 12 is approved, the two lawyers would be replaced by additional Abbott-appointed citizens, putting the governor in charge of seven appointments — a majority of the body.

Proposition 14 would create a $3 billion Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain-related conditions.

It just needs rules and regulations.” From Field to Flight Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights.
Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.
“That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels.","Ethanol’s next chapter could power the planes of tomorrow — but only if carbon-smart farming and flexible policy take off together.

Corn may soon fuel more than cars. With airlines under pressure to decarbonize, ethanol is emerging as a promising source for sustainable aviation fuel. The technology is ready, the chemistry is proven, and the market potential is massive — but policy and timing could determine whether American farmers lead or get left behind.

The Inflation Reduction Act created the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit to reward fuels with low carbon intensity (CI) scores. The lower the score, the greater the credit. That simple equation could spark a new carbon race across agriculture, with every decision — from seed selection to nitrogen efficiency — influencing a farmer’s bottom line.

Kansas Corn’s director of policy and economics Taylor Williamson recently spoke on the topic at the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) Forage, Turf and Conservation Seed Conference in Kansas City. He explains that race is already underway, but the rules are still unclear. He says the government’s delay in finalizing the 45Z regulations is putting growers at a disadvantage.

“If Treasury doesn’t get these rules out soon, it’ll be too late for the 2026 crop,” Williamson says. “Once the seed is in the ground, it’s too late to change your CI score.”

He believes the program could be a powerful tool to inject dollars into the ag economy if it’s rolled out in time for farmers to respond.

“This is one way to put cash into the ag economy during a time of really bad prices,” he says. “The program already exists. It just needs rules and regulations.”

From Field to Flight

Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights. Even a small percentage of global jet fuel made from ethanol would have ripple effects across the grain economy.

Williamson breaks it down simply. If SAF could become 1% of the world’s aviation fuel, and 1%of that came from ethanol-based SAF, that would use about 5.6 million bushels of corn — roughly 10% of Kansas’ annual production. Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.

“If an airport like Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport converted half its jet fuel to SAF made from ethanol, that’s 389 million bushels,” he says. “That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels. But when we talk about a scenario like DFW, we’re assuming a full 50% SAF made purely from ethanol.”

He says the potential for ethanol-to-jet-fuel production not only strengthens corn markets but creates a symbiotic relationship with the livestock industry. Ethanol’s byproduct remains feed grain, keeping value cycling through rural economies.

“There’s not enough used cooking oil in the world to fuel every plane,” Williamson says. “If we want real sustainable aviation fuel, ethanol has to be part of the solution.”

Flexibility Over Mandates

To qualify for the highest 45Z credits, farmers may need to meet specific carbon-reduction standards based on production practices. That could include adopting no-till, planting cover crops, or switching to enhanced nitrogen fertilizers. Williamson says the intent is good, but the approach risks being too rigid.

“Don’t tell us exactly how to do it,” he says. “Just give us a number, give us the data, and we’ll go do it.”

He says although Kansas is known as The Wheat State, its plentiful corn farmers know better than anyone that what works in one field may fail in another. Eastern Kansas often benefits from cover crops that improve soil health and water retention. Western Kansas, with half the rainfall, can’t often afford to sacrifice moisture to a cover crop stand.

“Cover crops work in some places and not in others — and that’s okay,” he says. “Not all farmers, especially in Kansas, farm the same way.”

Williamson argues that flexibility, not prescription, will determine whether the program succeeds.

“You can’t accomplish your goal unless farmers can make it work for their bottom line,” he says.

Seeds of a Low-Carbon Future

The carbon-intensity push is already influencing conversations far beyond ethanol. Seed developers are exploring hybrids with better nitrogen efficiency and improved residue management. Agronomy teams are looking at how microbial products, stabilizers, and data analytics can cut emissions. Ethanol plants are developing traceability systems to verify the carbon profile of each bushel they buy.

Williamson sees this as a defining moment for the seed value chain — a chance to link genetics, agronomy, and markets in a measurable way. He believes farmers are ready to adapt, as long as risk and reward are balanced.

“Farmers aren’t afraid to innovate,” he says. “They just need to know a government program won’t put them out of business if they take a chance.”

For now, he says everyone is waiting on Washington. The potential for ethanol to power the planes of tomorrow — and for farmers to get paid for lowering carbon — hinges on clarity that hasn’t yet landed.",https://www.seedworld.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_1614423625-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:01.299935

The company, Vulcan Elements, announced the deal in a press release Monday in which it said, in total, the partnership involving the government will result in $1.4 billion dollars for it and American-based refiner ReElement Technologies to scale its domestic magnet supply chain.

Specifically, the firm, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, said the fresh funds will allow it to build a new facility in the U.S. and increase magnet production to about 10,000 metric tons a year, with a “focus on recycling end-of-life magnets and electronic waste.” ReElement Technologies, it added, will be able to expand its recycling and processing capabilities with the new cash.

A press release from the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology said the federal government signed a “non-binding” letter of intent to provide $50 billion to the company. The funds, according to the department, are set to be used for Vulcan Elements to purchase equipment for the production of domestic Neodymium Iron Boron magnets specifically, which it notes “have significant commercial and defense applications,” including for semiconductor manufacturing, robotics, industrial motors, electric vehicles, drones, fighter jets, nuclear submarines, satellites and more.

The money comes from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, championed by Democratic former President Joe Biden and passed by Congress when he was in office. As a result of the investment, the Commerce Department is set to take $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements, according to the government press release.

Along with the $50 million from the CHIPS program, the Defense Department will offer a $700 million conditional loan. ReElement Technologies will also receive an $80 million loan from the Office of Strategic Capital, Vulcan Elements said in its press release.

Additionally, the firm noted that as part of the overall deal, the loan to ReElement Technologies is being matched by a private investment while Vulcan Elements is also receiving $550 million in private capital.

“Accelerating Vulcan Elements’ rare earth magnet production is strategic to the United States and will have profound ramifications for industries including semiconductors, AI data centers, defense, aerospace, and automobiles,” Michael Grimes, executive director of the U.S. Investment Accelerator, said in a statement with the announcement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The move marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to bolster critical mineral supplies in the U.S. to rely less on China, which processes nearly 90% of the world’s rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Last month, President Donald Trump hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House to sign a new critical minerals deal, and the president inked several new agreements on the matter with nations on his trip to Asia last week.

The topic has also loomed over recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Trump threatening to place significantly higher tariffs on Beijing if it moved ahead with its announcement to place new export controls and restrictions on access to its rare earths. But China agreed to delay those new policies — and the U.S. said the same for its higher tariff rate — following a closely watched meeting between the countries’ two leaders in South Korea last week.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Rare_earth_AP_23026825512861_NAT_0823,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:20.308268

Constellation Energy owns or controls the four operating nuclear power reactors, located across three facilities, including Ginna, Fitzpatrick, and Nine Mile.
The federal nuclear PTC now being claimed by Constellation Energy will result in a $151 million benefit to electricity consumers in New York State.","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced a major affordability win for millions of New Yorkers: $151 million in energy bill savings in 2026 as a result of the State’s Zero-Emissions Credits (ZEC) program, with the potential for additional savings in future years depending on market conditions. These cost savings will flow directly to New Yorkers, reducing the costs associated with keeping vital existing nuclear power plants online.

“My top priorities are energy affordability for New York consumers and making sure the lights stay on,” Governor Hochul said. “The Zero Emission Tax Credit program is a prime example of how the state was able to take a federal tax credit and turn it into needed energy savings for ratepayers while at the same time supporting clean and reliable electricity generation in the state.”

The ZEC program was created by the New York State Public Service Commission in 2016 to compensate the four Upstate nuclear plants for their zero-emissions power. Under the program, any benefits received from the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) enacted in 2022 are required to be passed along to ratepayers.

Constellation Energy owns or controls the four operating nuclear power reactors, located across three facilities, including Ginna, Fitzpatrick, and Nine Mile. All three facilities are located along the southern shore of Lake Ontario. The federal nuclear PTC now being claimed by Constellation Energy will result in a $151 million benefit to electricity consumers in New York State.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said, “When the Commission initiated the ZEC program, it recognized that the program could be adjusted in the future if the federal government later provided financial support for nuclear power facilities. Today, we are seeing this in action through the nuclear production tax credit. This important federal support helps ensure New York’s plants can continue to provide clean electricity while offering significant cost-savings to New Yorkers statewide.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York utilizes a diverse set of resources, including its existing nuclear fleet, to support the State's continued energy security and ensure a clean, reliable and abundant energy system that is also affordable. The federal tax credits and broader support for nuclear energy are critical as we continue to explore potential applications of advanced nuclear technologies through our Master Plan process.”

This announcement builds on a series of affordability actions Governor Hochul’s Administration has taken to help New Yorkers manage energy costs:

Adopting an Enhanced Energy Affordability Policy (EEAP) that expands energy bill discounts to an additional 1.6 million New York households below state median income that do not currently qualify for low-income assistance. The EEAP is a landmark step forward in supporting energy affordability and ensuring that more New Yorkers — including both electric and gas utility customers — can afford to keep the lights on, their homes heated and cooled, and their families safe.

Redirecting funding to protect consumers, with $360 million in surplus funding from New York’s distributed solar program, NY-Sun, used to offset costs in the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s energy efficiency and building electrification portfolios by 24 percent in 2026 through 2030. The Commission further reduced program costs borne by ratepayers by an additional $340 million in 2025 and 2026, while expanding access to low-income participants.

Expanding funding and access for low-income participants, through the Commission’s May 2025 Energy Efficiency and Building Electrification (EE/BE) Orders for low and moderate income (LMI) and non-LMI consumers. The Commission increased funding levels from 20 percent of the historical EE/BE budgets under the Clean Energy Fund to 30 percent for LMI consumers. This is an annual increase of $132 million to LMI EE/BE programs, including a nearly $50 million annual increase for the EmPower+, program compared to previous spending levels.

Reinforcing consumer protections through stronger performance standards and enforcement authority. Since 2021, Governor Hochul’s administration has secured roughly $214.4 million from utility shareholders for the benefit of ratepayers.

Conducting management and operations audits to identify areas where improvements are needed to maximize ratepayer value. Governor Hochul directed the Commission to initiate the Comprehensive Management Incentive audit, which is examining incentive management compensation practices across the State’s electric, gas and water utilities. For the first time, this review will evaluate multiple utilities’ management compensation programs concurrently, rather than in isolation, and expand oversight to companies that have not previously been subject to this level of review. The audit aims to ensure that compensation is directly tied to performance metrics that improve service, reliability and affordability for New Yorkers. This audit will provide critical insights into best practices and identify areas where improvements are needed to maximize ratepayer value.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2024-04/electric-grid-power-lines.jpg?h=05130931&itok=7OvQ6Jlc,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:24.856187

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior.","EDITOR’S NOTE: In the final installment in our series on geothermal energy, its availability in the West and the implications in Greater Yellowstone, Madison Dapcevich looks at the future of geothermal sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs has a long history of psychiatric treatment. Predating statehood in 1889 by 12 years, the state’s only public psychiatric hospital has served some of the Rocky Mountain West’s most vulnerable populations. But it was resource intensive and costly to heat water for the patients. Then, in the mid-20th century, the hospital began piping water from a natural hot spring was piped into the area for use in laundry and shower facilities. Since at least the 1980s, Montana has eyed the hospital for its hydrothermal and geothermal potential.

Water has historically been pumped to the state hospital from the nearby Fairmont Hot Springs, a 152-room resort 15 miles south that utilizes naturally heated water to warm its purported healing pools and buildings. Recently, private companies have been exploring the feasibility of installing geothermal power systems near the springs to generate electricity and pump hot water, reducing heating costs for local residents.

John Metesh, director of the Montana Bureau of Geology and Mines, says his agency is currently creating an inventory of geothermal sites around the state to do so.

“This begins by looking at data from oil and gas wells because these sites are very deep, and companies exploring for oil and gas can afford to conduct exploratory drilling,” Metesh said. “They’re drilling into geothermal formations to extract gas. So, the bureau looks at the data compared with seismic activity and geophysics data to build out maps of geothermal areas.” Between six and eight sites in Montana show potential to be transformed into geothermal power facilities, he added, one of which is the Montana State Hospital.

A previous estimation conducted in 2000 by Metesh and his colleague Jodey Kougioulis identified five areas that could be considered for geothermal development, including those near Bozeman, Ennis, Butte, Boulder and Camas Prairie.

Similar programs exist around the state. In 2020, Romney Hall at Montana State University launched a geothermal energy system, which efficiently cools and heats campus buildings and reduces their reliance on fossil fuels.

Aside from geothermal energy production through power plant facilities, hydrothermal features allow hot water to be pumped to nearby communities. Since the heated water is already close to the surface, it can be used as a hot water and energy source.

The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology estimates roughly 150 springs and wells of low to moderate temperature could serve as potential geothermal resources, most of which are found in the southwestern part of the state. These abundant resources put the Treasure State in a unique position to become a major geothermal energy producer, particularly as its temperature extremes contribute to its place among the top five states with the highest per-capita energy consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, coal accounts for 45 percent of Montana’s in-state power generation and about 30 percent of total U.S. coal production.

But like other alternative power generation proposals, Metesh says the reality of switching to geothermal energy comes down to the simple economics of its production cost versus its benefits.

“As traditional power costs increase and co-location of sources and transmission/use improve, geothermal will become more attractive, but the cost of [geothermal] production still needs to decrease,” Metesh said. “Montana, in general, has moderate potential for commercial geothermal in two broad categories: eastern Montana geothermal systems related to oil and gas development, and western Montana fault-controlled valleys.”

The Bureau of Geology and Mines is now conducting a new survey to identify potential geothermal sites across the state and has published the raw data on its website. In addition to pinpointing well locations, the Bureau of Geology and Mines is also cataloguing the geochemistry of known geothermal areas and their aerial geophysics, such as magnetism or radiometrics, which allows for a subsurface view of the Earth without needing to drill.

“It’s giving us a good idea of where we can narrow down the areas to look and eliminate some of the other areas – some of these formations are warm, but not quite hot and are at a lower threshold than what we’re looking for,” said Metesh, who estimates that the report will be out next year.

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior. There, fluid warms to high enough temperatures to rise in fault lines as either hot water or steam, eventually reaching the surface. In shallow geothermal features like hot springs, accessing heat is relatively easy. But deep heat sources, those 10,000 feet and beyond, require large drills to access.

Current efforts by the Bureau of Mines and Geology pull available data from oil and gas exploration wells and seismic data indicative of fault-line fracture zones to “define and assess subsurface geology in areas that demonstrate higher-than-background temperatures.”

Angela Seligman, senior geoscientist at the nonprofit environmental organization Clean Air Task Force, notes that since extraction methods have recently improved, power plants can more easily access deep geothermal energy and produce energy from lower temperature resources more efficiently.

“We would like to think that all regions are thinking about geothermal energy as an important source of reliable electricity that is available 24/7,” Seligman said, “and that is also clean in terms of having little to no air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions.”

Metesh is optimistic about finding sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

NextStar Energy, Canada’s first large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, is expanding its operations with the launch of energy storage system (ESS) battery production starting this November. This new production line, added to the existing electric vehicle battery manufacturing, will be based in the Windsor facility, a key site for the company’s industrial expansion.

A new direction towards the energy storage market

NextStar Energy is incorporating Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry into its production, a technology particularly suited to large-scale energy storage needs. This strategic move complements the existing Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)-based battery production, used mainly for electric vehicles. By offering both chemistries, NextStar is well-positioned to meet the growing demand in the ESS market while continuing to supply its partners LG Energy Solution and Stellantis for electric vehicle batteries.

The global energy storage market is experiencing strong growth, driven by increased demand for grid stability and the rise of AI-powered data centers. This expansion is seen as a strategic opportunity for NextStar to strengthen its presence in the energy storage and electrification technologies sector, particularly in North America.

A local response to global industrial challenges

In addition to the vehicle battery production capabilities, the Windsor facility has added equipment dedicated to energy storage. To support this expansion, NextStar has invested in advanced technical training for its employees. Over 1,000 people have been hired to date, many of whom have participated in the “Battery Boost” program, developed in partnership with Invest WindsorEssex and Palette Skills. This program combines virtual reality simulations and hands-on training, tailored to the energy storage industry’s requirements.

Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, emphasizes that the company’s ability to rapidly respond to market demands reflects its flexibility and commitment to sustainable innovation. Thanks to a highly skilled team, the company is ready to begin mass production in the coming weeks.

Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the solar plants will bring clean energy to the local grid.
The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said.
State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.
So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.","Facebook parent company Meta will contract to purchase power generated at two new solar energy plants in Louisiana, a move that will help power the company’s new $10 billion data center and meet its long-term climate goals.

Meta has signed an agreement with Texas-based Treaty Oak Clean Energy, a builder and operator of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, to supply power generated at the 200-megawatt Hollis Creek Solar Plant in Sabine Parish and the 185-megawatt Beekman Solar Plant in Morehouse Parish. The plants will deliver a combined 385 megawatts to the local grid in Entergy‘s territory in northeast and west central Louisiana, Treaty Oak said in a statement.

While Meta will purchase the renewable energy credits associated with the two plants, the electricity produced will help power the social media giant’s new AI data center under construction in Richland Parish. As part of its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, Meta typically either purchases carbon removal credits or invests in renewable power projects connected to the same grid as its data centers and offices.

Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the solar plants will bring clean energy to the local grid. “When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid — and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana.”

The announcement follows the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s approval in August of a settlement with the Southern Renewable Energy Association, Walmart, the Sierra Club and others that allows Entergy to build three new natural gas generation plants and transmission facilities to power Meta’s data center, as reported by The Center Square.

As part of the settlement, Entergy committed to the expedited procurement and certification of up to 1,500 megawatts of solar or hybrid power, which Meta will use to help meet its clean energy targets. Entergy also agreed to update its request for proposals process for renewables to include wind energy.

Meta’s Richland Parish data center is expected to consume about 2,000 megawatts of power when it goes online, with its electricity demand potentially reaching as much as 5,000 gigawatts.

The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said. The company expects to bring both solar facilities into service in the third quarter of 2027. State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.

Treaty Oak, a portfolio company of Macquarie Asset Management, began construction on a 100-megawatt solar power plant in Arkansas in October 2024 and expects to begin producing clean energy in the first or second quarter of 2026.

Macquarie Asset Management is one of the world’s largest infrastructure managers with more than 105 gigawatts of green energy assets currently under development or in operation. On Oct. 23, Louisiana regulators approved a 200-megawatt solar plant near Bogalusa in Washington Parish being developed by Galehead Development, a subsidiary of Macquarie Asset Management.

Meta has contracted to purchase power generated at solar facilities in other states as well. The company agreed on Oct. 27 to purchase 600 megawatts from a large solar farm near Lubbock, Texas, which will feed the local grid beginning in 2027. So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.

To meet a pledge to be “water positive” by 2030, Meta has vowed to restore more water than it uses in its operations, and earlier this year the company committed to a reforestation and wetland treatment project at Bayou Pierre in the Red River watershed, near the company’s data center site in northeast Louisiana.

Meta is partnering with Houston-based Resource Environmental Solutions to improve water quality in the watershed through the restoration of a 316-acre cattle pasture to native forested upland and wetland habitats, according to Meta’s website. The company estimates the project will restore 36.1 million gallons of water annually to the Red River watershed.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/5.-Depositphotos_solar-panel.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:44.407087

Last week, Carolyn Fortuna had an interesting article on Kamala Harris. Within that article, Harris had a quote that asked an important question: “Why. Didn’t. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?”

Overall, the most obvious answer to that question was that she didn’t have much time. Introducing ideas takes time, especially when you are busy trying to introduce yourself to people. Getting those people to understand those new ideas takes more time. Getting them to see the implications is not quick or easy. Candidates tend to listen to polls for what people want now and then repeat it back to them. Staying the course is easier.

But we have time now. Time before the next presidential election. Time to explore new ideas. People have time to wrap their minds around them. We have the time to change course. Time to explore how to separate ourselves from the past and take a new path into the future.

Trump’s simplicity clearly reveals flaws in approaches that might have been less noticeable with a more moderate execution. Opinions are shifting against Trump’s policies, especially regarding trade. We can further expose bad policies. We can create contrast with better policy. Leaders have an opportunity to lead on policy ideas, even if they are not yet in power to execute them.

We also are free to separate ourselves from Biden. Blind loyalty does not help. We are free to criticize. The election is over. We do not have to debate whether distancing ourselves helps Trump. People can still support their team while policy evolves. Holding onto bad policy out of loyalty hurts us going forward.

Which gets to another article by Steve Hanley on trade. Whether or not you think anyone can truly win a trade war, the US is clearly losing. Tariffs are being taken up by a the Supreme Court this week, which could have a long-term impact not only on trade, but also on presidential powers. A shift in direction on trade could differentiate from the disfunction and lead to better overall policy moving forward.

Protectionism Increases the Price of Cleantech

Tariffs increase prices. Not just when a Republican is in office. When those tariffs target cleantech, they raise prices compared to fossil fuels and legacy industry. Subsidies can only partially compensate. Despite the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the net effect was increased US prices with trailing renewable energy and EV adoption rates.

In the US, we pay over three times as much per watt on solar panels compared to China. That price does not count the 45X transferable manufacturing tax credits that also add up to more than the total cost of solar panels in China. Those tax credits continue under Trump, even though the 30% residential consumer tax credit is going away at the end of the year. With a change in trade policies, solar panel prices could be closer to Europe.

The average transaction price for EVs in the US in August was $57,245, according to Kelley Blue Book, which is more than three times BYD’s average selling price of $16,700 for 2024. Those are not apples to apples metrics, as BYD’s number was the price of vehicles sold to dealers, rather than the retail price. However, even when factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, our prices were still far more than double. Now, the rising protectionism on materials and components and the elimination of consumer subsidies are poised to make EVs even more expensive. Many manufacturer subsidies also continue for EVs, including the $45/kWh Battery Production Tax Credit, but we are not meaningfully closing the price gap. Trade has the potential to drop EV prices below legacy fossil-fueled vehicles.

Increasing the price of cleantech has economic consequences. For solar, the bulk of jobs are associated with installation and implementation. Multiplying the cost of the critical enabling component impacts net jobs. Most of the economic and environmental benefit from clean technology comes from the decades of usage, rather than the initial manufacturing. Increasing the price of clean technology slows adoption and the resulting usage. That perpetuates fossil fuel use and extractive economic models. That put us on the wrong path in the long term.

Politics of Protectionism

Biden and Trump are easily the two most protectionist US presidents since Herbert Hoover. There is a simplistic “us vs. them” mindset behind protectionism that doesn’t appreciate the increased value creation that accompanies increased value exchange between countries. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Hoover’s protectionist policies amplified the Great Depression, which taught an economic lesson the hard way. Many people, unfortunately, forgot that lesson. The continued inflation of prices under Trump will likely lead to a painful reminder.

Among Democrats, Biden was the most protectionist President in the two-century history of the Democratic Party. There are relatively few policies that extend from the pre-Civil War Democratic Party through to the post-Civil Rights Democratic Party other than an aversion to tariffs. There have been some outlier policies, like LBJ’s chicken tax, but other Democratic presidents removed more trade barriers than they added. Biden also issued more sanctions than any prior president of either party. There is potential to differentiate from both Biden and Trump.

Not that free trade is a purely Democratic idea. The intellectual conservative movement, with people like Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley, supported free trade. Republicans after WWII saw the economic errors of Hoover and tended to support free trade with an overall bipartisan consensus. Up until Trump. I know Republicans who would like a return to more intelligent trade policy. There is also an opportunity for a Republican who decides to distance himself from the obvious destruction Trump is creating.

Trump started a love affair with tariffs that Biden accelerated. Biden being more protectionist in action than Trump’s first term but less protectionist than what Trump proposed for his second term did not create much contrast. Having a nuanced presentation on the same policy direction does not create a lot of differentiation either. Trump has taken protectionism to new levels in his second term. With enough time, Harris could have differentiated herself with support of free trade, rather than just continuing a slower protectionist escalation. If Harris had the opportunity to communicate a policy focused on increasing trade to support cleantech adoption and accelerate progress, the contrast would be even more significant.

Own Being Smart

At this point, many are probably thinking that what I just suggested would be political suicide. The common assumption is that there is no way that our populist politics based on personal attacks and soundbites would support rational policies. Xenophobes will persist in their ignorance. Bigotry will perpetuate its fallacies. But maybe. Just maybe. We are not giving people enough credit.

Maybe, if we take the time to talk to people in terms they can understand, they will start to understand the concept. Jargon and acronyms can be avoided, but full sentences and logic are good things. Simply parroting back what pollsters say voters already believe might get agreement. But it is not evolving the beliefs that can evolve policy.

A leader should lead people to a better path forward. Elections should not just be a popularity contest or a contest of insults. Pandering to the most ignorant elements of society can be effective in drumming up votes in the short term, but it really does not set up a competition that educated Democrats are positioned to win long term. A more intellectual approach could turn some people off. However, were those people ever going to strongly support a highly educated, mixed-race female lawyer in the first place?

So, own it. Take the smart position and take the time to explain that position. Republicans can also take smart positions with a more conservative approach. We can have intelligent debates from different perspectives. We have time before the next presidential election to shift the narrative. And many people are already realizing that there is something wrong with Trump’s policies, such as protectionism. A little guidance can help people to understand what is wrong. Taking a slightly less stupid position does not create contrast. Try being smart.

We can take a smart position on trade. And that is just one of several ways that we can pursue smarter policy moving forward.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/green-shipping.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:59.103336

Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue.
Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.
If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press.
Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.","Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates on Monday defended his call to refocus the climate debate on prioritizing human welfare.

In an interview with Axios n Monday evening, in front of about 1,000 students at the California Institute of Technology, Gates stood by the controversial memo he released last week, in which he argued that climate change is a serious problem but will not bring about the end of civilization. He also urged the world to focus more on preventing human suffering than on limiting rising temperatures.

“I’m glad people are listening,” Gates said at the event, noting it’s difficult to convey “nuanced positions nowadays.”

Gates has faced significant backlash from all sides of the climate debate since releasing his controversial memo on Oct. 28. Many conservatives have characterized the memo as a backpedaling of the pro-climate agenda.

“I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform last week.

But Gates, at the Monday event, pushed back against that take.

“It’s a gigantic misreading of the memo,” Gates said of Trump’s view and similar sentiments. Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.

“I didn’t think the memo was going to convert the non-believers into believers, and sure enough, it didn’t convert them,” Gates said at the event.

At a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the memo’s release, Gates recognized that the “tough truths about climate” contained in the memo were likely to be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

In the memo, Gates criticized the climate community for focusing too much on near-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diverting resources from effective ways of improving lives and mitigating suffering today.

Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.

“What world do they live in?” Gates said, noting many foreign aid budgets must choose between climate and public health. “This is a numeric game in a world with very finite resources, more finite than they should be.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP24260763800896-e1754390789918.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:43.735659

Following a change in presidential administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in a civil suit to rescind, and therefore weaken, regulations regarding safe drinking water.[i] These regulations addressed the presence of six specific short-chain chemicals called PFAS which are known to increase an individual's risk of cancer and other health risks such as kidney and liver damage, harm to reproductive systems, and cardiovascular diseases.[ii] The danger of these chemicals is evident by the fact that even low levels of the chemicals can still cause adverse health risks.[iii] Importantly, more than 70 million people utilize water systems with PFAS levels that are above the safe limit.[iv] Additionally, these chemicals, also known as “forever chemicals,” are known to take upwards of thousands of years to breakdown in the environment.[v] Instead of maintaining the existing regulations for PFAS chemicals, the newly proposed regulations will only filter out two types of the PFAS rather than all six of the ones regulated by the prior administration, hence leaving the country at risk for drinking water with higher levels of contamination than what is considered safe.[vi]

This action is demonstrative of the trend towards deregulation currently happening within the EPA.[vii] Where the core of this action is hidden under the guise of improving efficiency, the true purpose is one of corporate favoritism and allotting more power to the chemical industry, rather than a true concern for regulatory burden or the country’s health.[viii] This action revealed that the current administration and utility companies have put a price on the cost of safe drinking water for the public.[ix] The estimated $800 million cost of implementation to filter out PFAS is considered too expensive in protecting public health and has instead been characterized as an economic burden.[x] Moreover, environmental advocates characterize this action as wealthy industries taking advantage of the relationships they have with the administration.[xi]

The current limits on PFAS were recently imposed by the prior administration through an action which environmental advocates counted as a win both for the health of the people and the planet.[xii] Specifically, these limits, known as maximum contaminant levels, set the legal standard as to how much of these chemicals can be allowed in drinking water and still be considered safe.[xiii] This action was the first ever limit to be imposed on such chemicals and were expected to reduce exposure to them for over 100 million people, of which would have prevented 9,600 deaths as well as 30,000 illnesses.[xiv] While the water utility companies were set to fulfill these regulations and fully complete them by 2029, by loosening the reins on regulation the EPA risks severe delay and even potential elimination of safer drinking water as a whole.[xv] Unfortunately, this dangerous choice suggests the conclusion that $800 million is worth more to utility companies and the EPA than the cost of 9,600 lives saved by more stringent safety requirements on drinking water.

Despite the current administration promising to provide clean water and better environmental protection, it also promised fewer and looser regulations.[xvi] As such, there will be less regulations regarding not only drinking water, but greenhouse gas emissions, car emissions, and clean-up standards for coal plant waste.[xvii] The contradictory nature of promising safe and clean drinking water while reversing important regulations that would guarantee it has led many activists to call the EPA a mockery as this deregulation will continue to place the health of Americans and the environment in jeopardy.[xviii] Deregulation of clean drinking water as proposed by the EPA will eliminate or delay desperately needed protection for over 100 million people with water that has contaminants well above the safety standard.[xix]

However, not all hope is lost in the fight against PFAS. Many environmental nonprofit organizations have already filed suit against the EPA, countering the deregulation as a violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.[xx] Generally, this Act provides an anti-backsliding provision which prevents the EPA from repealing or weakening regulations once they are established.[xxi] Thus, to get around this provision, the EPA is asking the court to repeal this regulation on the grounds that it was improperly enacted.[xxii] The decision of the court rests on whether the regulations were properly enacted as per the Safe Drinking Water Act or whether they were improperly enacted on a procedural basis.[xxiii]

Ultimately, in attempting to deregulate safe drinking water, the EPA has proven to be an oxymoron. This current attempt at deregulation does not align with their mission of wanting to “protect human health and the environment,” but is indicative of avoiding expensive implementation costs.[xxiv] Unfortunately, the EPA does not seem to prioritize the very thing they were created to protect and made a costly decision which will adversely affect the health of America.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-04 20:02:08+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Musk's partisan actions cost Tesla more than 1 million car sales - Los Angeles Times,"Michael Hiltzik, www.latimes.com, michael-hiltzik",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-04/musks-right-wing-politics-cost-tesla-more-than-1-million-car-sales,"A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone.
Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.
The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied.
In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.
The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes.","If you’ve spent any time on a California freeway, you’ve probably seen an increasing number of Tesla cars on the road bearing anti-Musk bumper stickers.

“I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,” reads one. “Eco-friendly, not Elon-friendly,” reads another. Some bear Elon Musk’s name or image with a bright red slash through them.

Those defensive messages would seem to validate the reasonable expectation that Tesla Chief Executive Musk’s foray into partisan politics — specifically, far-right politics — has sapped the appeal among Democrats and liberals for a product that once proclaimed its owners’ commitment to the fight against global warming and other progressive policies.

A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone. They found that Musk’s partisan behavior has cost Tesla as many as 1.26 million car sales since October 2022. That’s when Musk acquired the social media platform Twitter and gave greater access on it to the far right and other extremist voices.

Musk intensified his partisan journey during the run-up to the 2024 presidential campaign, when he heavily funded Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, and after Trump’s inauguration, when he launched the DOGE service, which strewed chaos throughout the federal government by instituting mass layoffs purportedly in the name of budget-cutting.

What the sales numbers say is that “it’s probably not a good idea to alienate your core constituency with extracurricular political activities if you’re a CEO,” says Kenneth T. Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale’s School of the Environment and lead author of the paper.

The Yale researchers’ analysis of sales figures show that Tesla sales were stronger in Democratic-leaning counties than in Republican counties — until October 2022, when they began to plateau in Democratic areas and then began to fall. Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.

The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied. Republican and conservative car buyers have never been a target market for EVs generally, and Teslas particularly.

The Yale study also found that overall EV sales in the U.S. continued to rise after October 2022, benefiting non-Tesla makers of EVs and gas-electric hybrids at virtually a one-to-one rate—those products gained by about 1.26 million sales above what they would have been without the Musk effect.

I asked Tesla to comment on the Yale findings, but haven’t received a reply.

The Yale study points to the effects of CEO outspokenness for good or ill, especially when their topics have little or nothing to do with their companies’ direct interests. It’s one thing to go public with concerns about corporate taxes or tariffs, quite another to divagate into divisive political issues such as global warming or anti-LGBTQ discrimination.

The researchers also point to the Musk effect’s implications for public ecological initiatives, notably California’s EV policies. California’s official target is for 25% of new vehicle sales be for zero emission vehicles next, and 100% by 2035. But ZEV sales have stalled out, according to recent figures.

“The 2026 target was set when Tesla was rapidly increasing its sales,” Gillingham told me. “Without the Musk effect, it would have been easily met. Now it looks unlikely.”

In part that’s because buyers who formerly would have opted for a Tesla have shifted to other brands, but are choosing hybrids, which don’t meet the EV sales standard, rather than full electric models.

The study comes just as Tesla shareholders are scheduled to vote on a pay package for Musk with an estimated value of $1 trillion. The vote will come at the company’s annual meeting Thursday.

As I reported, that pay package treats Musk as the sole indispensable figure in Tesla’s future. But although the Tesla board members who approved the pay proposal described the milestones Musk must meet to collect the full value, the standards have been tweaked to make them more achievable than they appear on the surface.

Whether Tesla shareholders will ever come to see Musk as a drag on the company rather than its savior isn’t currently clear, but with Tesla stock trading at a meme-level price-earnings multiple of about 320 and a market value of more than $1.5 trillion, that epiphany plainly hasn’t occurred yet.

The effect that CEOs’ political excursions have on their companies’ fortunes has been debated for years. The common conclusion is that it depends on whether their statements and positions align with those of their core customer base, or flout them — whether they will “bolster brand loyalty or trigger a backlash against the CEO’s company, as Aaron K. Chatterji of Duke and Michael Toffel of Harvard wrote in 2016.

Chatterji and Toffel examined the impact of several CEOs’ criticisms of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015, which expanded the ability of defendants in civil lawsuits, including those alleging discrimination, to cite their religious beliefs as justification for their actions.

Among the law’s public critics was Apple CEO Tim Cook. Chatterji and Toffel found that Cook’s statement that the law might foster anti-LGBTQ discrimination reduced public acceptance of the law significantly, and even increased the popularity of Apple products. Other corporate leaders have spoken out in favor of international initiatives to fight global warming.

Such forthright commentary about current events and issues are rare, however. The reason may be that it’s difficult for a high-profile executive to keep track of the shifting winds of public discourse; what may appear to be a popular position at one time can draw brickbats as public opinion evolves. Corporate interests may also outweigh the desire to be heard on issues of public concern.

In recent years, many corporate leaders pledged to stand firm against right-wing assaults on voting rights, access to women’s reproductive healthcare, diversity and democracy itself.

Many companies initially promised to end or review their campaign contributions to the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over Trump. Over time, as it happened, many resumed their contributions.

Toyota, for instance, continued to contribute to some of those politicians, explaining that it “supports candidates based on their position on issues that are important to the auto industry and the company ... We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress back on their votes on the electoral certification.”

How CEO comments are received by their presumed audience can depend on their context. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff was long regarded as an echt San Francisco liberal billionaire. But last month he came out in favor of deploying the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, evidently aligning himself with Trump’s militarization of local law enforcement.

Clearly, Benioff didn’t read the room. His statement caused a furor, prompting some entertainment figures to drop out of Salesforce’s annual tech conference, Dreamforce, causing the prominent venture investor Ron Conway to resign from a Salesforce philanthropic board, and culminating in Benioff’s apologetically withdrawing his suggestion.

Musk is a unique personage in the CEO ranks, as the Yale researchers observe — “the world’s wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization.”

Tesla’s sales pattern is also unusual in terms of the EV market. The company’s unit sales in the U.S. fell year-to-year in 2024 (by 5.5%) and through the third quarter of this year (by 4.3%). In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.

Tesla has faced a raft of challenges not directly related to Musk’s personal behavior: an aging product lineup, competitive models from Hyundai, Audi, GM and Ford, and the Edsel-esque sales flop of Musk’s pet project, the Cybertruck.

The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes. They found that “more Democratic counties show an increasing propensity to purchase Teslas over time prior to October 2022.” After that point, the trend reversed.

By the first quarter of this year, they found, without the Musk effect, Tesla monthly sales would have been about 150% higher than it was. From October 2022 through the first quarter, they calculated, the lost sales totaled 1 million to 1.26 million vehicles, or 67% to 83% of actual sales during the period.

Over the same time frame, sales of EVs and hybrids by Tesla’s rivals gained 17% to 22% due to consumers rejecting Musk, providing “a clear example of very significant adverse impacts on corporate performance due to the social and political decisions by one of the world’s best-known CEOs.”

The Yale paper suggests that Musk may be too well-known to be good for Tesla. His identification with the company has long been crucial for its success and for its high-flying stock price. The new study suggests that Musk has turned, at long last, into a negative.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20f40ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5390x2830+0+382/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2F2c%2Feba036fe40b0b290e86da0d56353%2F1497888-me-tesla-drivers-betrayed-by-musk-5-gmf.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:36.236039

2,000 Miles for 2 Years

The offer (see Tesla’s current offers here) says that trading in an old car for a new Tesla will result in 2,000 free Supercharging miles. That’s a nice thing to have for long-distance travel, especially considering the size of the Supercharging network.

The “Supercharging miles” must be utilized within two years of delivery, or they will expire:

“Terms & Conditions

Promotion requires completed trade-in of a gas or hybrid vehicle and is subject to change or end at any time. Supercharging miles expire two years after delivery date and cannot be postponed, assigned or redeemed for cash. Supercharging-related fees, like congestion fees, still apply. Used cars and B2B sales not eligible. Promotional miles may be revoked if the trade-in cannot be completed for any reason. Actual miles may vary and is dependent on factors like driving behavior and environment. Terms and conditions apply.”

What Models?

Tesla already offers Free Lifetime Supercharging for the Model S and Model X as part of the Luxe Package (standard on all versions). The same concerns the top-of-the-line Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast.

This means that the latest incentive will only apply for the Model 3, Model Y, and regular Cybertruck AWD. These are less expensive Tesla EVs, so the incentive is also much smaller compared to Free Lifetime Supercharging.

The Value of Free Supercharging

It’s always tricky to estimate the value of free Supercharging. The prices of energy vary significantly between states, and there are different use cases.

If we assume a Tesla Model Y with an energy efficiency of 3.5-4 miles/kWh, then 2,000 miles should result in 500-571 kWh. The numbers might be slightly lower for the Model 3, and noticeably higher for the Cybertruck AWD.

We are not sure how Tesla calculates the number of kWh a user should get (most likely based on the EPA test cycle), but assuming 570 kWh and roughly $0.40/kWh, the incentive’s value is $228. It might be closer to $200 for the Model 3 and closer to $350 for the Cybertruck AWD.

The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.","BISMARCK, N.D. — A multistate carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, helping reduce emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide to be forever buried underground in Wyoming.

Meanwhile, intense opposition has hounded similar projects, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success. But Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline is being praised because of community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing the gas before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles of pipe and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. The South Dakota Legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit stated.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations like a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was sent to a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska. His home is half a mile from the pipeline.

Tallgrass benefited from working with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost said.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold Nebraska, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://djcoregon.com/files/2025/11/1105_Pipeline_Infrastructure_WEB.jpg?_t=1762284559,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:15.403101

“Homes and businesses across my district are being forced to spend far too much on rising energy costs,” said Stuart. “This legislation will provide immediate short-term relief while making strategic investments in clean energy to secure lower consumer energy costs long term.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further.

In an effort to combat these rising costs, highlights of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) include:

– Virtual Power Plants: By capturing clean energy already being generated as surplus power by home solar panels and other green sources, better coordination through virtual power plants can redistribute energy across the system and lower costs for all consumers. This change is expected to reduce bills by up to $4.34 per month for Ameren users.

– Increased Battery Storage: Adding battery storage will make the grid more reliable and affordable, further acting as insurance for the system. This improvement is expected to lower bills for Ameren customers by up to $8 each month.

– Energy Efficiency: By expanding and investing in energy efficiency programs, Ameren consumers are expected to save up to $1.41 per month.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill—including 50,000 manufacturing jobs projected to be lost in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

The European Union's member states have been haggling for months over two separate targets for slashing greenhouse-gas emissions: one for 2035 they must bring to the UN climate talks, and the other for 2040.

""This is a crucial day,"" French Environment Minister Monique Barbut told reporters in Brussels -- warning that turning up empty-handed at the November 10-21 talks in Brazil's city of Belem would spell ""disaster"" for the EU.

Behind only China, the United States and India in terms of emissions, the EU has been the most committed of the major polluters to climate action and has already cut emissions by 37 percent compared to 1990 levels.

But after blazing a trail, the EU's political landscape has shifted right, and climate concerns have taken a backseat to defence and competitiveness -- amid concerns in some capitals that greening Europe's economy is harming growth.

""It's very, very difficult,"" said an EU diplomat, summing up the state of play in Brussels late Tuesday.

Denmark, which holds the bloc's rotating presidency, was understood to be working hard to win over Italy, one of the countries most sceptical of the proposed targets.

The most urgent challenge for ministers is to reach a unanimous deal on an EU emissions target for 2035, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which Paris Agreement signatories are supposed to bring to the COP30.

""I want our heads of state and government to go to Brazil with a very strong mandate, a clear leadership role for Europe,"" German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider declared on arrival -- saying the decision must be ""today"".

Beyond the Belem target, the EU hopes to lock in the support of a weighted majority of countries for the next big climate target set out by the European Commission on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050.

The EU executive said in July it wanted to cut emissions by 90 percent by 2040, compared to 1990 levels -- a major step towards net zero.

But the bloc's capitals have yet to endorse that next step, which would require sweeping changes to industry and daily life at a time of growing concern over adverse impacts on Europe's economy.

Spain and the Nordic countries support the 2040 proposal, as does Germany, with some caveats. But Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy remain opposed, citing risks to their industrial sectors.

Heavyweight France, meanwhile, has kept observers guessing on its position -- demanding guarantees its nuclear sector would not lose out under green transition plans and wiggle room on emissions should Europe's forests absorb less carbon than expected.

- 'Not pretty' -

To win over the staunchest sceptics, Tuesday's talks were covering a range of ""flexibilities"" for member states, including letting countries count carbon credits purchased to finance projects outside Europe.

A commission pledge for credits to account for up to three percent of a nation's 2040 emission cuts failed to win over hardliners, with countries pushing for a higher threshold of five percent.

Some also want the overall objective reassessed every two years.

Regarding the 2035 target for Belem, EU countries in September agreed to a non-binding ""statement of intent"" for the bloc to cut emissions by between 66.25 percent and 72.5 percent by 2035.

To avoid deadlock just days before COP30, ministers are expected Tuesday to formalise that range as the bloc's legally binding NDC under the Paris Agreement.

Environmental groups have accused states of undermining the bloc's climate ambitions with loopholes.

But a diplomat involved in the process defended the compromise shaping up in Brussels, while conceding it was ""not necessarily pretty"".

""In the muddy, messy, nasty real world out there, we are trying to achieve something good,"" said the diplomat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive deliberations.

The EU insists it remains committed to its role as global climate leader, having mobilised 31.7 billion euros ($36.6 billion) in public climate finance in 2024, making it the world's largest donor.

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform.","As the U.S. accelerates towards a future of innovative transportation, not all states are keeping up. The rate of electric vehicle adoption across the country is more varied than many realize and is often shaped on a state-by-state basis by state policies, ability to deploy infrastructure, and economic or demographic factors. With some states surging ahead and others lagging behind, it’s crucial to map and analyze the differences to understand how to close the gaps.

Using data from the Department of Energy, state transportation agencies, and the third quarterly electric vehicle report by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, The General has put together a guide to help you navigate these trends.

The leaders: Top states driving EV adoption

As outlined within the Alliance for Automotive Innovation Q3-2024 electric vehicle report, some states are already recording remarkably high electric vehicle shares among their new auto sales. Other states are going even further, boasting significant electric vehicle fleets compared to their population.

Many West Coast and Northeastern states are leading the charge. However, the data also shows an interesting statistic: The highest state has only 5.8% adoption of electric vehicles in operation. This goes to show that despite the rapid evolution of technology, its adoption is still in its infancy.

California: The undisputed champion

California is the undisputed champion of electric vehicle adoption across the United States, holding the aforementioned 5.8% total electric vehicles among those in operation. This value amounts to over 1.8 million vehicles. Part of this is due to the fact that, as outlined in the report, the Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter emissions standards. This has incidentally led to accelerated growth of the market, in addition to the state’s long history of electric vehicle incentives and dense urban markets.

Washington: High per-capita performance

Washington also ranks as a top performer in the country, with 3.1%, or over 219,000, of their total vehicle fleet being made up of electric vehicles. While they are ranked fourth on a percentage basis, they are second only to California on a number basis. They are also one of the six states that adopted the ACC II ZEV mandate that goes into effect with the 2026 model year, which effectively prohibits the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.

Vermont: Small state, big impact

Vermont is special, not because it rivals California and Washington in terms of the number of electric vehicles in operation, but because of its market penetration. As outlined by Visual Capitalist data from the end of FY23, Vermont had one of the highest electric vehicle registration rates per 100,000 residents at roughly 1,100.

Falling behind: States struggling with EV adoption

While some states are surging ahead, others are still facing issues. There are more reasons than one for why a state may be lagging behind, but below are some of the key trends:

Mississippi: Lowest adoption in America

At 0.21% based on the Alliance for Automotive Innovation data, Mississippi has the lowest adoption rate in the country. It also has one of the lowest rates of electric vehicles per charger across the country at a meager 14, ranking it near the bottom for electric vehicle adoption in more ways than one.

Rural state challenges

One key challenge for electric vehicle adoption lies in the demographics of certain states. Small, dispersed, or lower-income states can sometimes face additional issues. Take the following three states, for instance:

North Dakota: North Dakota is the 48th most populated state and has a population density of only 11 people per square mile. Building out a charging infrastructure is expensive, and doing it for such a low population density can only exacerbate the issue.

Wyoming: Wyoming faces the same issue as North Dakota, with an even lower population and population density based on the same World Population Review Report. With few electric vehicles and limited grid connectivity given the space between people, adoption lags.

Arkansas: Unlike North Dakota and Wyoming, Arkansas has a larger population. However, the appetite for electric vehicles in the state has been cited as being low, particularly due to the rural nature and distance between potential charging sites.

Key factors driving the divide

There are some common barriers to entry for the electric vehicle market. It’s worth taking a deeper dive into three of the most prominent:

State policies and incentives

The states leading the charge are those that are pairing strong incentives with regulatory mandates. Six states adopted the mandate limiting gas-powered sales starting in 2026. Based on the same data source, an additional six signed up to start in the 2027 model year.

Beyond this, state policy extends further. California has 48% more electric vehicle chargers than gas nozzles now, demonstrating the investment in the technology. Other states more towards the bottom of the list simply aren’t matching this investment.

Charging infrastructure distribution

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation report also tells an interesting story regarding electric vehicles per public charger across the U.S. Buyers won’t commit to an electric vehicle without realistic access to a charging port, and the difference in charging density across the country is vast.

New Jersey, Illinois, Oklahoma and Hawai‘i rank at the bottom of electric vehicles per public charger. States that have a higher electric vehicle to port ratio face a greater potential strain and wait time at those sites, de-incentivizing purchasing such a vehicle.

Demographic and economic influences

Beyond state policy and infrastructure, there also could be socioeconomic conditions at play. The average transaction price for an electric vehicle sale in August 2025 was nearly $60,000, based on Kelley Blue Book data, which is no small sum. For states with smaller populations and less developed economies, the average salary range may put this price point far out of reach for the time being.

Looking Ahead: Future trends and implications

Continued investment into programs such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure plan outlined by the Department of Energy will be crucial to the future of the market. Another factor that will inevitably shape the market will be the cost of technology utilized in the construction of electric vehicles, as a reduction could bring the entry price point down far enough for more state populations to partake. Overall, though, it will take widespread state policy changes to ensure there is a reliable electricity supply and smart charging available to service electric vehicle fleets as they develop.

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America

Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform. While states like California, Washington, and Vermont are leading the charge, others are lagging behind due to socioeconomic and political factors. These reasons aren’t mysterious, and the right mix of policy changes and investments in infrastructure can make a significant dent. As the nation continues to adopt cleaner transportation, ensuring no state is left behind will be critical to the development of a nationwide electric vehicle infrastructure.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rpaPjeQLGzykNhVguBWx2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/stacker_642/587000606d8bc5446b789a9ab2ff3044,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:18.816270

Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million.","Rivian and Lucid entered this week’s third-quarter earnings with investors watching every dollar, every unit, and every forecast cut.

Rivian reports after the bell today, and Lucid follows on Wednesday, and both companies expect higher revenue and smaller adjusted losses, helped by what analysts say was likely the peak of U.S. EV sales before federal credits disappeared in September.

But the bigger story is the pressure ahead: shrinking margins, reduced production guidance, and a policy environment that just made life harder for “pure-EV” manufacturers.

RBC analyst Tom Narayan said, “Both of these are really challenged,” adding that in the near term, “it’s all about the underlying profitability.”

That profitability is exactly where the cracks show, because Rivian has already cut expectations for 2025 gross profit and adjusted earnings, while Lucid faces similar margin strain.

Both of these guys are trying to convince their current and potential investors that they have long-term plans worth sticking around for, but in an era of tight competition, they’re finding that harder than it used to be.

Credit cuts, tariffs, and changing policy reshape revenue outlooks

The Trump administration this fall removed the federal EV purchase incentive of up to $7,500 and also ended penalties for automakers who fall short on fuel-efficiency targets.

RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s CEO, said during the company’s last earnings call that the policy changes are “complex and rapidly evolving,” and will affect both performance and cash flow.

Rivian had expected $300 million in regulatory-credit revenue this year; that is now closer to $160 million. The company also lowered its gross profit forecast from a modest gain to roughly breakeven and carried out layoffs to cut expenses.

Tariffs are adding more pressure. Rivian said tariffs are costing the company “a couple thousand dollars per unit.” Lucid reported that tariffs hit its margins by $54 million in the second quarter.

Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs said the loss of Inflation Reduction Act credits could create a “double-digit percent headwind” for industry sales. Tesla, also a seller of regulatory credits, reported credit revenue dropping 44% in the third quarter, from $739 million to $417 million.

The third quarter was the high-water mark for EV demand before credits expired. Barclays analyst Dan Levy warned that it’s unclear how long the slowdown that follows will last, saying Q3 likely marks “the highest” U.S. EV market penetration for some time.

Rivian delivered 13,201 vehicles in Q3, a 32% increase from last year. Lucid delivered 4,078 vehicles, a 47% rise. Yet both remain unprofitable.

Rivian is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.72 per share on $1.5 billion in revenue, compared to a $0.99 loss on $874 million last year. Rivian also now projects a core loss between $2 billion and $2.25 billion for 2025. Analysts have questioned its goal to reach EBITDA profitability by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted per-share loss on $379 million in revenue, nearly 90% growth from last year, but still with a gross loss of $255 million. Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million. Rivian shares are down less than 5% this year. Lucid shares are down roughly 45%, after a 1-for-10 reverse split.

New models and tech partnerships aim to prove future demand

Rivian is leaning hard on its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle, targeted at roughly $45,000 and scheduled to begin production in the first half of next year.

But many of Rivian’s competitors plan similar-priced midsize EVs with longer ranges, so you get why Wall Street is questioning how many units Rivian can realistically sell.

Rivian has a $5.8 billion software and electrical architecture partnership with Volkswagen, and the company has been promising that its next-generation system will support advanced driver-assistance features since at least Q1 2025.

Meanwhile, Lucid’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said their upcoming Gravity SUV and a new midsize platform, saying the company is “pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be.”

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July to deploy 20,000 Gravity SUVs equipped with autonomous technology from Nuro over six years.

But Winterhoff admitted on Tuesday that:- “We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year. We believe we will significantly increase production in the second half of the year.”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lucid.webp,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:49.112639

NEW BEDFORD — As the assembly line of turbine towers standing at the quayside of the staging terminal peters out, Vineyard Wind has more than doubled its power production, according to the latest federal data, even as the Trump administration keeps trying to shut down the offshore wind industry.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released the latest data on electricity sold by Vineyard Wind on Oct. 31. In the third (and latest) quarter, July through September, the project sold approximately 136,000 megawatt-hours of energy, up from 57,000 in the second quarter.

What does that mean for Massachusetts residents? The under-construction project sold enough electricity this summer to power an estimated 50,000 homes, up from about 33,000 in the spring, The Light calculated. (Depending on the residential consumption over a month or year, the homes-powered estimate can vary by thousands.)

Vineyard Wind and state officials say the project will power up to 400,000 homes when completed. The company declined to comment on the latest figures, which it reported to the federal agency.

The project is producing power from about 50% of its turbines as of October, according to an Oct. 28 report from Iberdrola, the project’s parent company. It’s an increase since July, when company officials said 17 turbines were generating nearly 30% of the project’s power.

What’s left?

More than two years since it sent the first set of turbine components out from the Port of New Bedford, Vineyard Wind has at most five of its 62 turbine towers left to install as of the end of October.

At the start of October, a Vineyard Wind spokesperson said the project was delivering at a capacity of 400 megawatts, or about half of the 806-megawatt project.

Satellite images from late October reviewed by The Light, which capture the project’s expansive white blades popping against the atmospheric view of the Atlantic, showed at least 56 towers were standing. Most of the towers have blades, but several don’t.

Vessel shipments suggest 57 towers may now be in, but more recent satellite images are not clear or capture clouds covering the lease site.

This week, vessel trackers show the installation vessel, the Sea Installer, near the location for a turbine that was shipped out on a barge in recent days, suggesting the installation of the 58th tower is underway.

In September, Vineyard Wind had only 10 “loadouts” to go, meaning 10 more barge shipments that usually — though not always — contain three blades, two tower pieces, and one nacelle.

It’s not clear whether workers will complete installation by the year’s end, as Iberdrola projected this summer. Construction usually slows in the colder seasons, which brings with it stronger winds and seas.

If Vineyard Wind doesn’t finish by December, the project has another six months on its lease to utilize the state’s commerce terminal.

New Bedford’s Marine Commerce Terminal, previously packed with blades, nacelles and towers for Vineyard Wind, has grown sparse. Blue metal cages that once hugged the components are now empty and stacked, waiting to be shipped out.

After all 62 towers are installed, work may continue with the help of a second specialized installation vessel, the Wind Pace, which has been at work removing blades and taking them to Canada as part of the government-mandated response to the July 2024 blade failure. The new replacement blades have been coming from a French factory.

In October, the terminal took in three vessel shipments from France, altogether carrying more than 20 blades, as well as a shipment of tower components. Meanwhile, one vessel carrying at least four blades set course for Canada, according to Port Authority vessel alerts and images shared by West Island Weather Station.

Vineyard Wind, 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, is Massachusetts’ only offshore wind farm currently under construction and generating power.

New England Wind 1 and SouthCoast Wind, two other Massachusetts wind projects that intend to base some operations or construction out of New Bedford, face mounting delays due to the Trump administration’s opposition to the industry.

The Trump administration is looking to remand critical permits for those two Massachusetts projects. From January through September, the administration took more than 20 actions against multiple offshore wind projects (and the industry at large) through numerous agencies.

Revolution Wind, contracted by Rhode Island and Connecticut, is also under construction to the west of Vineyard Wind. Its developer, Orsted, is using New London, Connecticut, as its staging area. Sunrise Wind, another Orsted project, is in earlier stages of construction. Orsted completed a 12-turbine farm, South Fork Wind, last year.

Estimating homes powered

According to the FERC report, Vineyard Wind 1 produced about 136,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy in the last quarter, which spanned July, August and September.

Using recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data, which captures monthly residential consumption only up to August of this year, The Light estimated about 50,000 homes powered for just the months of July and August. During this period, the average household usage was about 760 kilowatt-hours in Massachusetts.

Usage is often higher in the summer, as that’s when people are running their air conditioners. It’s greater than the monthly average calculated over a year, which was 580 kilowatt-hours in 2024.

Using the lower, year-round figure, The Light estimates Vineyard Wind sold enough energy to power up to 78,000 homes.

ISO New England, the grid operator, publishes data on what resources are powering the grid at any given time. However, the company does not disclose the electrical output of specific projects, citing “confidentiality rules.”

The project’s 806-megawatts figure represents the nameplate capacity, which is the amount of energy a project could generate if its turbines ran 100% of the time at optimal wind speeds.

In reality, a wind turbine’s output ranges, affected by wind speeds and downtime for maintenance; it varies on a given day, week, and month; and it underpins an important concept: capacity factor. If a 100-megawatt project has a capacity factor of 50%, it produces 50 megawatts on average.

Offshore wind projects have a capacity factor ranging between about 40% and 50% (sometimes a bit higher). It’s comparable to the rates achieved by coal and natural gas plants, per federal data.

Vineyard Wind has not provided details on the project’s capacity factor thus far. A 2020 construction and operations plan for the project listed a capacity factor “in excess of 45%.”

Generally, capacity factor increases in the winter, when wind speeds are higher. Because of seasonal variability, this metric is best calculated over the course of one year.

It’s likely that once Vineyard Wind reaches full power, the FERC electricity reports will vary by season.",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1387.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:42.953903

DETROIT — Challenges are mounting for all-electric vehicle manufacturers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group as the companies try to sell investors on a brighter, more profitable future to come.

But things could get worse before they get better as both automakers are set to report third-quarter results this week, starting with Rivian after the bell Tuesday, followed by Lucid on Wednesday.

Both ""pure EV"" companies are expected to report notable growths in revenue and narrowed adjusted earnings losses amid record third-quarter U.S. EV sales. But investors are also expecting the manufacturers to give updates on future growth opportunities as well as impacts from more challenging market conditions.

""Both of these are really challenged,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan told CNBC during an interview, saying he's cautious about much near-term upside for investors. ""To me, it's all about the underlying profitability.""

Both automakers have already cut vehicle production guidance due to more challenging market conditions, while Rivian also has negatively changed its adjusted earnings and gross profit expectations for 2025.

EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs due to tariffs and slower forecasted sales of EVs, as well as company-specific problems that include new product challenges, and regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.

The Trump administration this fall got rid of federal incentives of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV. In addition to that, it also ended the practice of fining automakers for failing to meet fuel efficiency rules. That hurts EV manufacturers, which had been counting on selling credits to legacy automakers that could offset some penalties.

Rivian this summer cut its expected earnings from credit sales from $300 million to $160 million. In connection to the change, Rivian also lowered its gross profit guidance for the year to roughly breakeven from a modest profit. It also has conducted layoffs this year to cut costs.

""While we believe deeply in the long-term value drivers of our business, the policy environment continues to be complex and rapidly evolving,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the company's last quarterly results call in August. ""Changes to EV tax credits, regulatory credits, trade regulation and tariffs are expected to have an impact on the results and the cash flow of our business.""

Rivian has maintained that it has enough cash to get it through the launch of its new ""R2"" product during the first half of next year, but the ongoing changes don't assist the company by any means.

Tariffs are hitting the automaker to the tune of ""a couple thousand dollars per unit"" this year, Rivian has said. Lucid also said tariff costs are hurting its profit margins this year, including $54 million during the second quarter.

""We expect the loss of the credit to be a headwind for the market in the coming quarters. Our prior elasticity of demand analysis implied that the loss of IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] credits could equate to a double-digit percent headwind to industry volumes, all else equal,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in an Oct. 3 investor note on Rivian and Tesla.

Tesla , which has also sold automotive regulatory credits, reported revenue from those credits in the third quarter fell 44% to $417 million from $739 million.

Pull ahead, Q3 results

The third quarter is expected to be the peak of EV sales for the foreseeable future, as customers rushed to purchase new models ahead of the federal credits ending in September.

As a result, the companies are expected to spend more time touting future products and technology opportunities to investors during their third-quarter calls this week rather than their near-term core businesses of producing and selling EVs.

""It remains to be seen how long the EV hangover will last in the US, though we suspect 3Q EV penetration will likely be the highest mark for quite some time,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an Oct. 13 investor note.

Rivian last month reported vehicle deliveries of 13,201 vehicles during the third quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. Lucid reported deliveries of 4,078 units, up 47% from 2,781 units from the third quarter of 2024.

Even with an uptick in sales, both companies are expected to report notable losses, albeit narrowed from a year ago and smaller than the second quarter.

Rivian is expected to report an adjusted earnings per share loss of 72 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. That would compare to an adjusted EPS loss of 99 cents on revenue of $874 million a year earlier.

When reporting its second-quarter results, Rivian said it expected its adjusted core loss to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion this year, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast. Analysts also have expressed concerns about Rivian's previous goal to be profitable on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted EPS loss for the third quarter, down from $2.80 a year earlier (based on recalculated results following a reverse stock split), on a roughly 90% increase in revenue to $379.1 million, according to LSEG.

Narayan and other analysts have largely focused on improvements in the gross profits of the companies as proof of progress. Such results are a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest, and taxes deductions.

""[Investors] will want to see what that gross profit number is in Q3, but they also have a high bar to pass over with where consensus already is,"" Narayan said.

Rivian is expected to report a gross loss of $39 million during the third quarter, according to average estimates compiled by FactSet. Lucid, meanwhile, is expected to report a $255 million gross loss, according to the estimates.

Shares of Rivian are off less than 5% this year, while Lucid's stock is off roughly 45%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split in September.

Product and tech promises

Both Rivian and Lucid have tried to sell investors on the success of their future vehicles as well as technologies to save the companies from continued losses.

Rivian's future heavily relies on its new ""R2"" vehicles that are expected to begin production for customers the first half of next year. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.

""I'm more bullish on this vehicle than any product we've developed. I believe that the product market fit is incredible. The packaging, the technology and overall value proposition set R2 up for meaningful share,"" Scaringe said in August.

However, the R2 will launch in a challenging market ripe with plenty of vehicle competition — many of which are expected to have longer EV ranges at a similar, if not lower, price.

Barclay's Levy earlier this year did an analysis of the potential total addressable market of the R2, questioning the company's bullishness on the product amid ""risks"" of weaker expected U.S. EV demand, additional costs and a more competitive market.

Narayan and other analysts also have questioned the company's sales targets for the vehicle: ""It's a very competitive market, and you have this EV slowdown in full effect. What are the volumes they're going to get on R2 going up against all this competition? … [General Motors ] can barely get to hundreds of thousands,"" Narayan said in the interview.

Rivian also has touted its potential for revenue with new technologies, such as the $5.8 billion deal it struck with Volkswagen for its software and electrical architecture.

Rivian has said the next generation of technology also is expected to help it become a leader in advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, despite the automaker trailing many other systems.

Lucid

The story is similar at Lucid. The company has placed significant importance on the launch of its Gravity SUV, which Lucid has described as challenging, as well as a future midsize vehicle platform to broaden its market reach.

""We are not simply building electrical vehicles. We are pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be,"" Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said during the company's second-quarter call in August. ""From the record-breaking performance and efficiency of the Lucid Air to the game-changing Lucid Gravity, to our upcoming midsize platform, our technology continues to redefine what's possible.""

More recently, Lucid also has touted future ADAS technologies and the potential of personal autonomous vehicle capabilities as part of its future, despite a history of underwhelming capabilities in its current luxury models.

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro over the next six years.

Other topics investors will be watching include any updates to Rivian's timeline for its R2 production or Lucid's production of the Gravity SUV as well as cash flows and profitability outlooks for both companies.

""We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year,"" Winterhoff said in August. ""We believe we will significantly increase production [in] the second half of the year.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107420148-1716586096525-gettyimages-2154514894-js1_9845_axy5pfiz.jpeg?v=1751487196&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:04.127244

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.
Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.
Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.” “Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.
“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.","Rhode Island’s four Democratic congressional delegates demanded that the Trump administration release funding for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a 40-minute late morning press conference Monday in Cranston.

If they had stayed for just four more minutes, they would have received the news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to comply with a court order to partially fund SNAP for the month of November.

But U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse were off to Washington D.C. where the Senate was set to resume at 3 p.m. after a weekend recess. U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner remained in Rhode Island — though both noted they have returned to D.C. on a weekly basis despite the House not meeting since the shutdown began Oct. 1.

At 11:59 a.m., the USDA submitted a four-page report responding to an order from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. to force the Trump administration to pay at least a portion of benefits to the 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits by the end of Wednesday, despite the government shutdown.

Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture is complying with the court’s order and will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for states to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that state,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in the Trump administration’s court filing submitted one minute before the administration’s noon deadline.

Rhode Island receives about $29 million each month to administer the SNAP program across the state. Food pantries around Rhode Island are seeing increased demand as SNAP recipients prepared for the first lapse in benefit payments in the program’s history. Food drives have been organized by labor unions, local nonprofits, and advocacy organizations to support the RI Community Food Bank and food pantries across the Ocean State.

The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Community Center in Newport saw a 34% increase in people using its food pantry in the month of October compared to September, according to its email newsletter.

“Trump can move very fast when he wants to,” Amo had told a half dozen reporters inside the office of the National Education Association of Rhode Island headquarters on Bald Hill Road in Cranston. “So why can’t he find the time to work on behalf of the hardworking Americans who make this country what it is?”

McConnell on Saturday gave the Trump administration two choices after ruling it must use available funds to keep food aid flowing: Cover partial benefits through a $5.5 billion contingency fund or find other reserves, or to pay for a full month tapping into additional revenue sources such as the Child Nutrition Program.

The USDA opted for the latter, stating in an attached declaration that officials determined child nutrition funds “must remain available to protect full operation” of programs through the federal fiscal year.

“Using billions of dollars from Child Nutrition for SNAP would leave an unprecedented gap in Child Nutrition funding that Congress has never had to fill with annual appropriations, and USDA cannot predict what Congress will do under these circumstances,” wrote USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn.

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.

“Why would you concede half when you’re conceding?” Reed said.

Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.

In a statement issued after 4 p.m., Reed called the administration’s decision to partially fund SNAP “a half-baked approach.”

“Partial funding hurts the whole country and underscores Trump’s gross mismanagement,” Reed said.

Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.”

“Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.

Magaziner called Trump’s actions “shameful and unnecessary.”

“Hunger should never be used as a political weapon,” Magaziner said. “We cannot give into their bullying. If we give in now, then it will be four more years of assaults on working people and we cannot go along with that.”

Reed warned the brief chaos from the SNAP cuts will become the norm after the “Big Beautiful Bill” adopted by Republicans in July reduced $186 billion from SNAP funding through 2034.

“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.

Rhode Island’s congressional delegation has voiced similar concerns about other federal aid programs, particularly health care subsidies. The delegation echoed Senate Democrats’ demands that Congressional Republicans extend the Obama-era subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.

Whitehouse said he is confident the GOP-controlled Senate will start to come to the table to meet Democratic demands and end the shutdown.

“They’re feeling the heat,” Whitehouse said.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ReedNextToFood.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:35.861751

The Department of Energy chose Argonne and Fermi national laboratories for quantum research projects five years ago. They were among five laboratories across the United States that received $25 million-a-year grants over five years, but the grants expired Sept. 30.

EARLIER:

Chicago-led quantum research effort in the running for $160M from NSF

Dario Gil, undersecretary for science at DOE, announced the re-authorization of the grants this morning at the Chicago Quantum Summit, a two-day gathering of 700 researchers at Willis Tower.

The funding supports more than 500 research jobs at the two national labs, including more than 100 students at the University of Chicago. It also adds more fuel Chicago’s quest to become the nation’s top hub for quantum science, which is the next generation of computer and communication technology. In addition to Argonne, Fermi and the Chicago Quantum Exchange, the state is building a quantum research park on the former U.S. Steel South Works factory, which was championed by Gov. JB Pritzker, who committed $500 million in state economic-development funds to quantum.

“Our research will continue uninterrupted,” said David Awschalom, a quantum researcher at the University of Chicago and chief science officer of one of the DOE-funded QNext quantum information research center at Argonne. “It’s fantastic news.”

The funding also is a boost for Fermilab in Batavia and its work in quantum materials and sensing. “This renewal allows us to build on that foundation and take the next leap: moving from discovery to deployment,” Anna Grassellino, director of Fermi’s Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, said in a statement.

Paul Kearns, director of Argonne, called the announcement “excellent news” that will allow the research facility near Lemont to make additional investment in tools and equipment and bring on some additional staff. More than 200 researchers are involved in the quantum research center at Argonne.

Gil, a former top IBM research laid down a daunting challenge for quantum researchers, saying the Tump administration wants to have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running by 2028. Such a computer would be both stable enough to be usable and large enough to be commercially useful.

“By 2028, we need to demonstrate the first generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of performing the next frontier of scientific calculations,” he said. “It is the time to build this first of a kind scientific instrument for the nation, and we will and we must accomplish this.”

The timeframe aligns with those of startups such as PsiQuantum and Infleqtion, both of which are building quantum computers at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park that is being built along Lake Michigan on the far south side. If the companies can deliver, it will put Chicago at the center of what Gil described as “a revolution in computing that’s going to transform how science and technology is practiced and how R&D is done.”

Sen. Dick Durbin welcomed the money announced today but says more will be required. “It’s undeniable that Illinois is at the forefront of groundbreaking quantum research, with Fermilab and Argonne leading the charge,"" Durbin said in a written statement. ""I’m encouraged to see continued investment in our national labs, but if we hope to maintain our position as a global leader in quantum technology, our federal government must supply the funding to match this ambition.”

Quantum computing, which involves using tiny particles to carry information at exponentially greater rates than traditional technology, is expected to enable breakthroughs in research such as drug discovery and materials science, as well as encryption of communications and data.

The basic research has been underway for decades. The technology is still unproven, but companies such as IBM and Google have made significant progress in the past few years. Gil believes quantum is at an inflection point.

It’s part of a larger goal he described of doubling scientific productivity and impact within a decade. The vision is to combine high-performance computing, AI and quantum, which will “allow us to solve some of the most challenging scientific problems of this century,” Gil said, while also framing quantum development as a critical national security goal.

“There is no doubt that our most formidable competitors and geopolitical adversaries aim to achieve similar goals,” he said. “And reap the benefits of economic and national security that would come with success. We cannot allow that to happen. It is unacceptable for the U.S. not to lead in quantum and AI.”

Argonne is at the center of that strategy. Gil pointed to the success in developing exascale supercomputers—or machines that can perform a quintillion — or 1 billion-billion — calculations per second. Such machines, including a half-billion-dollar computer at Argonne known as Aurora, were built in less than a decade.

The Energy Department doubled down on its investment in a new generation of supercomputers to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, choosing Argonne last week to build a system with more than 100,000 Nvidia graphics-processing chips.

The program is a response to Trump’s executive order, which called for the operation of a US Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic nuclear installation by September 2028.","Skeptics doubt new reactors, but AI demand, defense projects, and federal financing could spark a real US nuclear energy revival.

In the sea of enthusiasm for the global expansion of commercial nuclear power, there are modern-day Nostradamuses confidently predicting failure.

“Most [small modular reactors] SMRs are on paper [… and] the tech bros don’t seem to be grounded in reality,” prophesized a Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairperson in a recent BBC interview.

On social media, a noted nuclear power critic predicted, “you must know that none of this is actually going to happen” when referring to new nuclear microreactors “that are doomed to fail.”

It is very possible that these criticisms will be proven correct, and small reactors under 300 megawatts (MW) may lose steam as they slog through the thicket of design, licensing, and demonstration. Certainly, a new report on OKLO raises numerous concerns about technological readiness.

Also, as the critics note, there are no new commercial nuclear plants in the United States under construction or even under contract by energy utilities at this time. There are lots of memoranda of understanding (MOU) and paper reactors, but not much groundbreaking.

But the Trump administration has promulgated reams of requirements for advancing nuclear power, including adding 300 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear energy capacity by 2050, and now has a plan to add financial fuel to this process.

The question is whether the critics are right and there are too many holes for projects to fall through, or whether the Trump mandates will shock the slow-to-change nuclear energy ecosystem into supercharging deployment.

AI Energy Expansion

The Trump administration’s nuclear energy objectives are fueled by several imperatives, but a core one is to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race with China.

That means it needs to concentrate capital and energy resources on the data center buildout. Today, the United States has 522 data centers, about half of the world’s total. Another 280 are expected to come online by 2028. This would jump energy demand in this sector from two percent of total US electricity to 12 percent.

The United States is currently adding only about 65 GW to the grid, but according to an ICF International analysis, it “should be adding about 80 gigawatts of new power generation capacity a year to keep pace with AI as well as cloud computing, crypto, industrial demand, and electrification trends.”

The last nuclear power capability the United States added was the completion of 2.2 GW at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating site in Georgia in 2024. By contrast, China has 33 reactors under construction and another 43 planned.

Since then, several shuttered nuclear plants have been slated for refurbishment in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. They will contribute new energy in the next few years, along with power uprates for existing reactors that are expected to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

The partially completed VC Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina will be finished now that the Santee Cooper utility has chosen Brookfield, Westinghouse Electric Company’s majority owner, to complete the work on the AP-1000 reactors.

A number of tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and META, are investing in small reactors that will power the AI race, and Microsoft is supporting the restart of a shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island.

Reactor Role Reversal

The critics are betting that the challenges of achieving commercialization will sink the small reactor data center rally. Driving this view is a trifecta of concerns about emerging reactors’ cost-effectiveness, licensing ability, and delivery certainty. It may take a decade or more before these reactors are ready for deployment. By then, the AI boom may have slaked its energy thirst.

Evidence is already accumulating that proven large reactors in the one GW range, like Westinghouse’s AP-1000, are becoming more appealing for AI power after being cast aside in favor of the smaller newcomers.

Except for NuScale’s Voygr small modular reactor, no US-based SMRs have received NRC design approval, while the AP-1000 is licensed and has been built in the United States and abroad.

But AI is not the only application for small reactors. There are industrial applications for small reactors, including process heat, and small and disaggregated power grid uses that exist in developed and developing countries. The X-Energy deal with Dow to power the Seadrift plant is a good example of matching power plant output and consumption on one large industrial footprint.

Outside the United States, the Canadian Province of Ontario has approved the construction of four 300 MW General Electric Hitachi BWRX reactors at the Darlington nuclear plant. Ontario and the federal government committed $3 billion Canadian dollars for the project. If licensed, these would become the first commercial SMRs operating in North America. That will provide important concrete cost and construction information that may be applicable to other small reactor deployments.

Financing

Spinning up the American nuclear buildout will require billions in financing, and the history of significant cost overruns on previous plant construction casts a shadow on private sector financing enthusiasm.

The Trump administration, however, does not seem to be deterred by this history. It has embraced and revamped the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office into the Energy Dominance Financing Program (EDF), which has an objective of “reinvigorating the nuclear industry.” It demands that projects move forward expeditiously.

EDF seems prepared to provide tens of billions of dollars in nuclear project loans beyond the commitments it has made to date. And, while the administration is willing to work with utility companies on this nuclear build-out, it is not waiting on them.

As part of its shockwave shake-up of the US nuclear industry, the Commerce Department has entered into a binding term sheet to facilitate financing of $80 billion for the domestic and overseas deployment of the AP-1000. The US government will be granted a participation interest of 20 percent of any cash distribution over $17.5 billion earned by Westinghouse if it secures the funding and assures the reactors will be completed.

Large reactors may be the next residents on federal land if Fermi America is any indication. That project aims to become the country’s largest nuclear complex, with multiple AP-1000s at the site.

But several factors need to fall together for the free flow of money to matter, including creating an assured fuel supply, developing significant efficiencies in the reactor Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) process to reduce overall cost and construction time, and rebuilding or importing a skilled labor cadre.

This is where US allies like South Korea could play an important role, particularly on AP-1000 construction. South Korea has experience with AP-1000s at home, has a world-class nuclear construction capability, produces components America can’t, and possesses a substantial and well-trained workforce. Korean companies are already partners in some US SMR projects.

Fuel Supply

Access to high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) nuclear fuel is a major bottleneck for small reactors, and fuel supply could become a challenge for the US nuclear fleet if domestic uranium enrichment can’t quickly scale up.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations made revitalizing US nuclear fuel production a priority. The reasons were to reduce dependence on Russian fuel imports, increase domestic uranium enrichment, and ensure that a steady supply of fuel is available. Collectively, the two administrations have devoted billions to uranium enrichment.

The Trump administration is also enamored with plutonium as a fuel, and recently offered to provide nuclear companies access to almost 20 tons of weapon-grade plutonium for reactor fuel. Tens of millions of dollars in research on plutonium reprocessing technologies have been provided by both administrations.

Nuclear critics have cited nuclear proliferation problems associated with the use of HALEU and weapon-grade plutonium in the civil nuclear fuel cycle. For now, the administration is pushing forward on multiple nuclear fuel fronts, but it is not certain that its efforts will succeed in substantially breaking out of the reactor fuel bottleneck.

Military Reactors

While SMR skeptics are relying on the commercial requirements to smother the viability of next-gen reactors, they have not adequately accounted for the commitment of the US Department of Defense (DOD) to the development of small reactors. The key projects are Project Pele and the Janus Program. And DOD has vast experience turning nascent technology into commercial products.

The PELE reactor is a 1.5 MW TRISO-fueled, gas-cooled demonstration micro reactor that is manufactured by BWXT Advanced Technologies. The project broke ground at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2024, and the reactor is expected to begin operation in 2028. The goal is to provide the US military with “a mobile, reliable, sustainable, and resilient power source which does not require a long logistics tail.”

The Janus project was launched in October 2025, and it is designed to be a micro reactor of one to 20 MWs that provides power for national defense facilities and critical missions. The program is a response to Trump’s executive order, which called for the operation of a US Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic nuclear installation by September 2028.

The Janus reactors will be commercially owned and operated and could provide power to the local grid. The Army wants pairs of reactors demonstrated to underscore that the effort is not just research and development but aimed at wider-scale deployment.

There are questions about the ability of a reactor controlled by the defense department to provide commercial power, but the Atomic Energy Act does provide some authority.

Export Markets

The export of American nuclear reactors has slowed dramatically over the past 40 years but is now showing some signs of life. The AP-1000 is slated to be built in Poland, with the reactors possibly being deployed in Finland, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Much of this interest is driven by the need to decouple from Russian energy.

US small reactors, however, are not faring as well in the export market in part because of the focus on the need to demonstrate them in the United States first.

However, these SMRs have applicability as an export technology, particularly to developing economy nations with growing populations and energy demand. But there is the need to first develop the nuclear power capacity and infrastcuture in many of these nations.

The United States has a slow, stepwise process for developing nuclear power capacity in countries that need assistance. It emphasizes training, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing. It has not resulted in the development of many markets for emerging US reactors, although it has provided SMR simulators to Romania and Ghana.

That process needs to evolve into one that identifies target countries and then applies the necessary technical and financial resources to develop them for the import of US small reactors. The think tank, Clearpath, has developed the concept of Energy Security Compacts (ESC) that would align US nuclear and financial tools to achieve this goal. It proposes 5 to 10-year agreements that align the various bureaucratic elements of the US government to work toward “clear, measurable outcomes” that support US foreign policy and energy security objectives.

This concept would strengthen the ability of the United States to win nuclear markets against the state-financed companies of Russia and China, which are already operating their own SMRs. And seizing markets outside of North America for US small reactors would push forward their commercialization in America, thereby responding to the concerns of the critics.

García, Colleen DeGuzman, Alex Nguyen, Carla Astudillo",,,,,https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/04/texas-water-supply-proposition-4-election-2025/,"Texas’ water supply has long been under duress.
“This is not economically feasible otherwise,” said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association.
Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.
According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state’s leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state’s water supply.

Texas’ water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall’s ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state’s water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

“There’s going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. “But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.”

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

“This is not economically feasible otherwise,” said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. “These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.”

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

“That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it’s bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,” said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. “All the programs are so oversubscribed that it’s not like that was new money for new fun projects.”

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

“Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,” said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. “Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.”

Clearer accounting wanted

There’s rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

“The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,” Mazur said. “And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.”

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

“There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,” Fowler said. “But I don’t think they’re being irresponsible.”

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

“I think it’s going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they’re completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,” Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

“As great as this billion is, and if we’re going to get it every year, it’s never going to be enough,” Fowler said. “We’re probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we’re seeing is we’re not able to meet the demand we have.”

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board’s own estimates in the state’s 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

“I don’t think we’re going to end up with a scenario where there’s just money sitting around not being used,” Schlessinger said. “My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.”

Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy.
We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending.","Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message for the 2025 Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in Nairobi today:

The new Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme, is clear and uncompromising.

If nationally determined contributions are fully implemented by 2035, global warming would reach 2.3°C – down from 2.6°C in last year’s projections. That is progress, but nowhere near enough.

Current commitments still point to climate breakdown. Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5°C is now inevitable — starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a liveable future gets steeper by the day.

But this is no reason to surrender. It’s a reason to step up and speed up. 1.5°C by the end of the century remains our North Star. And the science is clear: this goal is still within reach, but only if we meaningfully increase our ambition.

Our mission is simple, but not easy: Make any overshoot as small and as short as possible; reach global net-zero emissions by 2050 and move swiftly onto a progressive, irreversible net-negative pathway; and bring the global temperature increase back below 1.5°C by the end of the century.

That means peaking global emissions immediately; achieving far deeper emission reductions during this decade; cutting methane sharply; accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and protecting forests and oceans — our carbon sinks.

Make no mistake: Any period of overshooting will inevitably bring dramatic consequences – with lives lost, communities uprooted and development gains reversed. But we have the solutions to make this overshoot as small, as short and as safe as possible.

That demands a massive scale-up in renewables and adaptation backed by a surge in finance for developing countries. Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy. Costs are falling, investments are rising, innovation is surging.

Clean power is now the cheapest source of electricity in most markets and the fastest to deploy. It strengthens energy security, cuts pollution and creates millions of decent jobs.

Leaders must seize this moment and waste no time in tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency by 2030; building modern grids and large-scale storage; and ending all new coal, oil and gas expansion in a just and equitable manner.

The clean energy revolution must reach everyone, everywhere. But developing countries face crippling capital costs and a fraction of global investment. They also need far greater support to adapt to worsening climate impacts — protecting lives and building resilience.

We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending. Developed countries must lead in delivering predictable, affordable finance through multilateral development bank reform, effective debt solutions and tools that crowd in private investment at scale.

COP30 [thirtieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] in Belém must be the turning point where the world delivers a bold and credible response plan to close the ambition and implementation gaps; to mobilize the $1.3 trillion a year by 2035 in climate finance for developing countries; and to advance climate justice for all.

The path to 1.5°C is narrow but open. Let us accelerate to keep that path alive for people, for the planet and for our common future.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:25.455187

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

The DOE has acknowledged several risks associated with nuclear power, including public perception, safety concerns, high upfront costs for power plants, and the safe disposal of used fuel.
Not to mention, it provides a major opportunity for the U.S. to take the lead in the digital and clean energy transition.
""The work being carried out at NNSA to harness AI will have an impact on national security as the Manhattan Project did in the 1940s,"" Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and NNSA Administrator Brandon Williams said in the press release.","The National Nuclear Security Administration announced in late September that it plans to power massive new artificial intelligence data centers on two federal sites in South Carolina and Tennessee, which will help the United States get ahead in the AI race while reducing pollution from the industry.

As a news release from the Department of Energy detailed, the NNSA is ""seeking proposals from U.S. private sector partners"" to construct and power data centers on large tracts of land at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.

According to the American Nuclear Society, the sites were chosen because they can serve dual purposes: hosting data centers and nuclear power production, thereby boosting grid reliability, reducing energy costs, and bolstering national security.

Other selected sites include the Idaho National Laboratory and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, both of which are awaiting requests for proposals.

The NNSA has identified 10 tracts totaling more than 3,100 acres at the Savannah River Site for the development of AI data centers, along with approximately 44,000 acres at the Idaho National Laboratory, according to the ANS. The DOE stated that private-sector partners chosen for the project will enter into long-term leasing agreements at the site and will be tasked with constructing, powering, and decommissioning each data center.

""Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements,"" the DOE added.

While the DOE selected the sites for their easy access or potential for energy development, it also expects proposals to include innovative on-site energy generation, such as co-located nuclear reactors, geothermal energy, and energy storage solutions.

The DOE has acknowledged several risks associated with nuclear power, including public perception, safety concerns, high upfront costs for power plants, and the safe disposal of used fuel. It is working on many improvements, including ""accident-tolerant fuels"" that will boost performance and produce less waste.

Since data centers and artificial intelligence applications are notorious for needing enormous amounts of water and energy to operate, powering them with nuclear will help reduce heat-trapping pollution and conserve resources. Not to mention, it provides a major opportunity for the U.S. to take the lead in the digital and clean energy transition.

“Our study shows that the smallest ponds can make a big difference, emitting more carbon than larger waters just meters away,” said Kriddie Whitmore, a recent Ph.D. graduate from UNC who led the fieldwork and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Umeå University in Sweden. “These results highlight the need for increased research focused on small aquatic systems.”

By measuring emissions across ponds at different elevations and temperatures, the researchers found that elevation, water temperature, and how ponds connect with surrounding soils all strongly influence how much carbon they release. Contrary to past assumptions, smaller doesn’t necessarily mean less impactful.

“These areas have long been blind spots in global climate models,” said Diego Riveros-Iregui, the study’s principal investigator and professor of geography and environment at UNC. “By uncovering what drives carbon emissions in these remote, high-elevation ecosystems, we are filling a major gap in global climate science. This knowledge helps us refine climate models and better understand how tropical mountain landscapes influence Earth’s carbon balance.”

The findings suggest that high-altitude ecosystems like the páramo, which store vast amounts of carbon in their soils, could be important players in regulating the planet’s climate. Incorporating emissions from these small ponds into global models will help scientists make more accurate carbon budgets and predict how climate change might affect carbon cycling in tropical mountain regions.

The text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

We are writing to express concerns about the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) recent Secretarial order, which puts forward new requirements for Secretarial approval for routine permitting steps that risk delaying or blocking low-cost wind and solar energy projects. This order affects projects not only on federal lands, but also on state and private lands since DOI sign-off is needed at multiple steps during wind and solar project development – for example, ecological baseline studies, access road authorizations, federal wildlife permits, or utility corridor concurrences.

DOI’s recent Secretarial order, Departmental Review Procedures for Decisions, Actions, Consultations, and Other Undertakings Related to Wind and Solar Energy Facilities, outlines an expansive list of 69 DOI decisions and actions related to wind and solar projects that now newly require your personal review, including routine steps such as right-of-way applications or biological assessments. This ensnares virtually every ongoing wind and solar project in multiple layers of red tape and bureaucratic review, creating significant legal and regulatory uncertainty about timelines and raising questions about whether project approval is even possible. It also creates a significant deterrent to the development of new projects. This indefinite effective pause on wind and solar permits comes at a time of increasing energy demand and energy prices. It is difficult to understand how these actions align with the President’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability. With that in mind, we seek to better understand DOI’s rationale for these new policies and how they will be implemented in practice.

As you are aware, Western families, farmers, and businesses depend on reliable and affordable energy to power their homes, grow their crops, and keep our economy competitive. Clean energy is a cornerstone of that effort – generating 44 percent of electricity in our states while supporting good-paying jobs in both urban and rural communities and strengthening the region’s energy security. As the least expensive and fastest-to-deploy sources of new electricity generation, wind and solar are critical to meeting rising demand while keeping electricity affordable.

The Western Interconnection projects a 17% increase in peak demand between 2024 and 2034. Meeting this increase in the most affordable way will require 68 GW of additional solar and 40 GW of land-based wind over the next decade. Yet, DOI’s new policies effectively take these options off the table. If federal permitting for solar and wind does not resume soon, our states risk losing projects already in development. Cancellations or indefinite delays of this scale would eliminate expected capacity from the interconnection queue, jeopardizing energy reliability while increasing costs for Western families and businesses.

We request answers to the following questions:

How will DOI’s new heightened federal reviews be applied in practice? Specifically

Will this be applied to all projects or will certain projects be exempt?

If certain projects are exempt, can DOI lay out the criteria and process for an exemption?

How will DOI ensure transparency in this review process to provide certainty to developers and stakeholders?

How will DOI ensure timely approvals for wind and solar projects for all 69 listed items on the heightened review list given the likely bottleneck created by elevating 69 new decision and action items to your office?

Can DOI clarify how impeding the development and deployment of the lowest-cost and most widely available energy sources is consistent with the Administration’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability? Has DOI conducted any internal legal, environmental, or economic analyses to evaluate the effects of this order on the nation’s ability to meet those goals?

The DOI Secretarial order defines actions broadly enough that it not only affects solar and wind projects on federal lands, but also state and private lands. Please explain why projects largely dependent on state and private development should be subjected to heightened federal reviews?

To what extent, if at all, has DOI consulted with any relevant authorities – such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, or state Public Utility Commissions – to assess the potential implications of DOI restricting wind and solar power permitting on grid reliability? Specifically, has DOI examined how these new actions might impact resource adequacy, reserve requirements, or reliability metrics such as loss of load expectation if there’s no new generation buildout?

Western states have led the way in demonstrating that clean energy strengthens local economies and the electric grid, setting ambitious goals for its energy transition. Additional layers of federal bureaucracy could effectively stall new renewable projects, forcing Westerners to face higher costs, less reliable energy service, and fewer opportunities for economic growth.

I urge you to address these questions swiftly and work in partnership with states to ensure that federal permitting supports, rather than undermines, efforts to build a secure and affordable energy future.

About the e-bike program CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

Where is the money going instead?

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

About the e-bike program

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious and significant step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways ... when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/964abe9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F46%2F54d8ee634d70a3d414de9b540b55%2F240823-valenciatelegraphbikelanes-33-bl-qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:02.188012

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,’' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. “We have to go faster.”

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics.","WASHINGTON — Sales of U.S. light vehicles fell in October as the expiration of federal government subsidies undercut demand for battery-powered electric cars, and an easing labor market and looming higher prices from tariffs could limit any rebound this year.

Light vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units last month, data from market analysis firm Omdia showed. Unadjusted sales of electric vehicles dropped to 74,897 units from 98,289 units in September.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill approved by the U.S. Congress this year eliminated $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and a $4,000 used-EV credit at the end of September. The subsidies, implemented by the previous Democratic Biden administration, boosted EV sales in recent years.

“Sharply lower electric vehicle sales, following the expiration of the federal tax credit on Oct. 1, reduced dealer volumes over the month,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Financial. “With concerns about the labor market building, the near-term outlook for auto sales could be soft as more consumers stay away from auto showrooms this holiday season.”

Overall unadjusted light vehicle sales were down 4.5% in October from a year ago. Last month’s sharp decline would suggest moderate or weak retail sales in October. But a 35-day shutdown of the government, on track to be the longest on record, has led to an economic data blackout.

The Chicago Federal Reserve is estimating retail sales excluding motor vehicles increased 0.3% last month after a projected 0.4% gain in September.

Limited data have suggested the labor market has remained stagnant since August, with layoffs still relatively low and hiring tepid. Economists say demand for labor has ebbed because of economic uncertainty, tariffs and companies embracing artificial intelligence. A sharp reduction in workers because of raids on undocumented immigrants is also weighing on the labor market.

A survey from the Conference Board last month showed consumers’ perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October. The unemployment rate was near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics. “New vehicles are one of the most exposed sectors to tariffs. So far, foreign and domestic automakers have largely absorbed the costs through their profit margins, but this isn’t sustainable.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9016199_web1_2025-11-04T170102Z_2_LYNXMPELA3100_RTROPTP_4_CALIFORNIA-CARS.JPG,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:30.728639

For now, it remains a concept

It’s a true technology showcase for TRD.

It boasts no less than 547 horsepower

Developed by Toyota Racing Development (TRD) engineers in California and North Carolina, with support from Toyota Motor North America’s R&D department, this concept was created for the SEMA Show in Las Vegas. With 547 horsepower, a nearly silent powertrain, and a wealth of camping innovations, the Tacoma H2-Overlander embodies the fusion of performance, sustainability, and adventure.

“We wanted to preserve TRD’s off-road and desert racing heritage while incorporating cutting-edge powertrain technologies,” said Craig Cauthen, manager of TRD’s Emerging Technologies Group. “This vehicle showcases the TRD team’s capabilities beyond the racetrack.”

Design and Functionality

The exterior adopts a decidedly utilitarian look, featuring a custom overlanding camper made with recycled carbon-fibre aerodynamic panels. Reinforced bumpers, integrated tow points, a winch, recovery board mounts, and full DOT-compliant lighting complete the package.

“The Tacoma H2-Overlander Concept illustrates Toyota’s multi-pathway approach to carbon neutrality,” said Mike Tripp, vice president of Toyota Marketing. “Under the theme ‘Powered by Possibility,’ we’re demonstrating that hydrogen is not only viable but central to our vision of the future. This concept proves that clean energy and real-world capability can go hand in hand.”

A true team player, this next-generation Tacoma can also assist other electric vehicles thanks to a 15-kW power takeoff capable of powering an off-grid home or charging two EVs simultaneously via NEMA 14-50 outlets.

High-Performance Fuel Cell

When not building roaring NASCAR engines, the TRD-USA team acts as an innovation lab dedicated to Toyota’s sustainability goals. It has notably developed mobile hydrogen generators capable of powering an entire race weekend without noise or emissions.

The Tacoma H2-Overlander carries that same spirit forward. It incorporates Toyota Mirai’s second-generation hydrogen fuel cell and three tanks holding a total of 6 kg of hydrogen, all neatly packaged within the frame. The fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen in a chemical reaction that produces electricity and water vapor and nothing else.

The setup is supported by a 24.9-kWh lithium-ion battery. Together, they power a 225-kW (302 hp) front motor and a 188-kW (252 hp) rear eAxle. The result: the instant torque and responsiveness of an EV combined with the fast refuelling benefits of hydrogen.

Power is delivered through a front limited-slip differential and a rear electronic locking differential, making it a true four-wheel-drive adventurer. The engineers also strengthened the chassis with a TRD long-travel suspension kit, Fox 2.5 Performance Elite Series shocks derived from the Tundra, and upgraded front brakes. The 17 x 8.5-inch wheels are wrapped in 35-inch off-road tires, while a custom TRD cooling system, inspired by the Tacoma TRD Pro and Lexus RZ, maintains thermal stability for both the electric and hydrogen systems.

Another remarkable innovation is TRD’s patented water recovery system. It captures and filters the hydrogen fuel cell’s only byproduct, water, making it usable at the campsite. This distilled, mineral-free water can be used for washing or cleaning. While not recommended for drinking, it provides a valuable resource for explorers far from natural sources.

Toyota bZ Time Attack Concept: Electrified Power Takes on SEMA 2025

From Concept to Reality

Transforming a gasoline-powered Tacoma into a four-wheel-drive hydrogen vehicle in just a few months was a monumental challenge.

“Time was our greatest enemy,” admitted Cauthen. “The question was: what can we achieve within a tight timeline to bring to SEMA a fully functional vehicle that once ran on gasoline and now runs on hydrogen?”

To meet this challenge, TRD teams relied on 3D modeling, additive manufacturing, and a cross-country collaboration between North Carolina and California. The project resulted in several firsts, including the water recovery system and a “roboformed” tailgate developed with Toyota Motor North America Stamping.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-Tacoma_H2_Overlander_Concept_Toyota_SEMA-5.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:10.908551

Established in 2017, Edmonton Global is the economic development organization representing 14 municipalities within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region working together on economic development. Throughout the last eight years, our mandate has remained clear and consistent:

Help local companies expand into new markets through trade, and

Attract foreign direct investment (FDI) — bringing new companies, capital, and jobs to our region.

Both goals are critical to building a resilient, diverse, and globally competitive regional economy – and both outcomes exist under the umbrella term, economic development.

When people hear the term economic development, they often think of visible changes — new buildings, local business openings, or business improvement districts. While those are positive signs, they don’t necessarily tell the whole story of true economic growth.

Real economic development happens when a community brings new money into its economy — through exports, tourism, or investment from outside its borders. That external capital expands the community’s economic base, supports employment growth, and creates a ripple effect that benefits local businesses and residents alike.

This is where foreign direct investment plays a vital role. When a company from another country builds a facility, hires local talent, or partners with local suppliers, it’s not just creating jobs — it’s injecting new income into the local economy. Those wages are spent in local shops, restaurants, and services, creating what economists call the multiplier effect – every export-oriented job supports additional jobs in local sectors.

Focusing solely on “supporting local” businesses, while important, isn’t enough on its own. To grow, a community must attract new capital and produce goods and services that reach beyond local borders.

Foreign direct investment ensures that new wealth flows into the region, fueling innovation and expanding opportunities for everyone — from skilled tradespeople and engineers to small business owners and service providers. It connects our local economy to the global marketplace — and in doing so, strengthens the communities that make up our region.

This blog is the first post in a two-part series that explores why FDI matters and how it supports long-term regional prosperity. In Part 2, we’ll dive into the data to see how the Edmonton region stacks up globally and nationally.

What is Foreign Direct Investment?

Foreign direct investment happens when a company invests in another country – this can be through building a new facility, hiring local teams, or acquiring an existing business. These investments can take many forms. Just a couple of examples could include:

A manufacturer opening a new plant (for example UK’s Linde is currently constructing a $2 billion hydrogen production facility in Fort Saskatchewan),

A tech firming hiring a local team of software engineers (for example French multinational Sia partners opening an Edmonton office in 2022), or

A global company acquiring a local enterprise to grow its operations (for example US multinational Johnson Controls acquiring local tech giant Silent Aire in 2021 for $1.3 billion).

These types of investments do more than create new facilities or business expansions — they generate lasting economic benefits. When companies invest abroad, they bring with them new capital, technology, expertise, and market reach, helping to strengthen local supply chains, create high-quality jobs, and build global connections.

In short, FDI is one of the most effective ways for communities to grow their economies — which is why countries and regions around the world compete to attract it.

Why FDI matters

Countries and regions around the world rely on FDI to provide good quality jobs for their communities. In the United States, approximately 16 million (or around one in 10) jobs were directly or indirectly attributable to FDI. Here in Canada, that number is even higher, with more than one-third of positions being held by multinationals. In Alberta, roughly one in every four jobs is tied to a multinational organization. Many of the Edmonton region’s largest employers – including Shell, Gilead, and Cargill – are foreign investors who have built long-term operations here. Others, such as Stantec, Bee Clean, and Capital Power, are homegrown companies that are investing abroad and are building globally competitive businesses from right here in the Edmonton region.

According to Statistics Canada, multinational companies now employ more Albertans than ever — about 685,000 in 2023, up from 527,000 in 2010 (Figure 1).

Figure 1

This makes Alberta the third highest province in Canada for number of jobs from multinational organizations (Figure 2).

Figure 2

The same dataset highlights which sectors have seen job growth driven by multinational companies. Between 2010 and 2023, employment from multinationals increased across nearly all sectors (Figure 3).

Figure 3

Looking ahead

Global FDI has more than doubled over the past two decades – growing from 0.77 trillion USD in 2003 to more than 1.34 trillion in 2024, with the strongest growth in technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Interestingly, investment flows for technology (especially electronics) surpassed energy and mining last year – bumping that sector into second; followed by general manufacturing in third (Figure 4).

This shows that Edmonton Global’s sector priorities are well aligned with global investment trends — all five of our focus sectors appear in the data, with energy and information technology among the top three.

Figure 4

Conclusion

These trends underscore why foreign direct investment is central to Edmonton Global’s mission. Each new investment represents more than capital — it’s a vote of confidence in our people, our industries, and our potential. By connecting the Edmonton region to global markets, we strengthen our local economy and ensure that prosperity is shared across our 14 municipalities.

In the next part of this series, we’ll examine how the Edmonton region compares nationally and globally, and where the biggest opportunities for growth lie ahead.",https://edmontonglobal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Title-Page.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:38.753271

The Path Forward This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability.","Last month, Governor Gavin Newsom wrapped up bill actions for the 2025 legislative session, signing into law a suite of measures that together comprise one of California’s most comprehensive climate and energy packages in recent years. This year’s session was defined by efforts to pair climate ambition with affordability, with major bills aimed at cutting costs, stabilizing markets, and advancing clean energy deployment.

CATF’s advocacy, expertise sharing, and policy development helped shape several of these wins. While the legislature advanced a broad set of climate and energy-related measures, the following bills reflect areas of most direct CATF engagement and alignment with current priorities — ensuring strong climate ambition, supporting durable market frameworks, enabling policies that help meet the state’s Scoping Plan targets, and advancing energy affordability for Californians.

Electricity Affordability

Electricity affordability is one of California’s biggest clean energy challenges, with rates far outpacing inflation over the last several years. A key legislative priority this session was to advance policies to address near-term and long-term drivers of rising rates. SB 254establishes financing reforms for a portion of wildfire mitigation expenditures — a major near-term driver of rate increases. To address costs of grid infrastructure over the next several decades, the bill contains a lower-cost alternative to utility financing by enabling public financing for transmission infrastructure. Analysis from CATF and Net-Zero California found that Californians could save $3 billion per year, or approximately $123 billion over 40 years, by replacing high-cost equity with lower-cost public debt financing in the form of a public-private partnership. SB 254 turns this research into action by establishing the California Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator to coordinate transmission planning, facilitate public financing, reduce project costs, and develop a public-private partnership plan to maximize public financing and ratepayer benefits. The bill also establishes the Transmission Accelerator Revolving Fund, seeded with $325 million from Proposition 4 and a five-year allocation of 5% of Cap-and-Invest revenues from utility allowances as established under AB 1207 (Irwin).

Looking ahead: SB 254 lays a strong foundation for delivering real savings and accelerating grid expansion. Its success will depend on how effectively the Accelerator can structure and deploy public financing to lower capital costs and demonstrate measurable ratepayer benefits.

Extending Cap-and-Invest and Strengthening Market Integrity

California’s Cap-and-Invest program is the cornerstone of the state’s economy-wide approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, providing a market signal for clean investment and generating billions in annual revenue for climate priorities. The program’s authorization was set to expire at the end of the decade; AB 1207 (Irwin) reauthorizes California’s Cap-and-Invest program through 2045, while companion legislation SB 840 (Limón) outlines a plan for allocating revenues from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Both bills contain provisions around the use of offsets. SB 840 directs CARB to update all existing compliance offset protocols by 2029 to reflect the best available science, with reviews every five years starting in 2034. AB 1207 caps the use of offsets at 6% of an entity’s compliance obligation, requiring that half of those offsets deliver environmental benefits in-state, and permanently retires an equal number of allowances so that their use effectively translates into a tightening of the overall cap.

SB 840 also directs CARB to consider new carbon-removal protocols and for the first time, earmarks funding for climate-focused technological innovation — a yet-to-be-fully-defined category of technologies that could range from carbon dioxide removal and storage to industrial decarbonization solutions.

Looking ahead: The reauthorization of California’s Cap-and-Invest program marks a pivotal moment for aligning long-term climate goals with durable market design. As implementation begins, attention will turn to ensuring that the Cap-and-Invest program maintains a high bar for climate ambition and that the offset protocols reflect best-available science. Recent research from CATF and leading U.S. forest carbon scientists found that while high-quality forest carbon credits are possible under California’s current protocol, the protocol needs to be strengthened to ensure credits deliver their promised climate benefits. The assessment offers a roadmap for incorporating new data and scientific advances to improve accuracy, durability, and transparency for forest carbon offsets.

Modernizing Permitting and Regulatory Frameworks for Geothermal Energy

California is home to some of the nation’s richest geothermal resources, which offer a vital source of clean, firm power that can operate around the clock to complement the state’s growing portfolio of renewables and battery storage. Yet development remains constrained by fragmented permitting processes, outdated well regulations, and high development costs. AB 531 (Rogers),expands eligibility for geothermal projects of all sizes to use the California Energy Commission’s “one-stop-shop” permitting process, providing an additional option to streamline project approvals. A companion bill, AB 527 (Papan), was vetoed and would have exempted exploration wells from CEQA under certain conditions and required the state to modernize its well regulations for enhanced geothermal systems.

Looking ahead: The veto underscores the need for modernizing the state’s geothermal regulations through administrative action and evaluating whether additional permitting streamlining measures are needed to accelerate project development. As outlined in CATF’s recent report, “Unlocking California’s Geothermal Potential: A Strategic Opportunity for Clean, Firm Power,” these are important components to unlocking the state’s full potential for clean, reliable, around-the-clock power.

Lifting the Moratorium on CO₂ Pipelines

California’s currentstrategy to achieve carbon neutrality calls for capturing or removing 100 million metric tons (MMT) of CO₂ annually by 2045. To help operationalize this pathway, SB 905 (Caballero, 2022) directed CARB and other state agencies to develop a regulatory framework for carbon capture, utilization, and storage and carbon dioxide removal to support the safe and effective deployment of these technologies. SB 905 also established a moratorium on pipeline transport of CO₂ until updated federal safety regulations were finalized.

With the timing of federal rulemaking still uncertain, the state has now taken action to pass SB 614 (Stern), which gives California the authority to define safe CO₂ transport. The bill lifts the moratorium on intrastate CO₂ pipelines and directs the State Fire Marshal to adopt safety regulations by 2026 that meet or exceed federal standards proposed by PHMSA in January 2025. SB 614 builds on the framework established under SB 905, ensuring that transport infrastructure for carbon management can be developed safely and consistently.

Looking ahead: Coordination across agencies will be essential to align safety, permitting, and public engagement processes. Effective implementation of both laws will help California advance carbon management projects responsibly and transparently.

Indirect Source Review for Mobile Source Pollution

Under the Clean Air Act, states and localities have the authority to regulate emissions from stationary facilities that attract mobile sources of pollution. In California, mobile sources contribute the majority of the state’s NOx emissions (a precursor to ozone and particular matter), and the transportation sector accounts for 40 percent of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect Source Review (ISR) can be a powerful tool to regulate mobile sources of pollution at facilities like airports, warehouses, ports, and distribution centers, and several districts in California have promulgated rules for warehouses and new development. This session, lawmakers considered two ISR bills. AB 914 (Garcia) sought to affirm the CARB’s authority to promulgate statewide ISR rules and clarify a pathway for state-wide regulation of pollution from major transportation hubs. The bill ultimately stalled, but the debate underscored the importance of using every available state policy tool to cut harmful emissions in the face of federal attacks on California’s mobile source regulations.

SB 34 (Richardson) would have imposed restrictions on the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s ISR rule for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, establishing a harmful precedent of legislative constraint on air district ISR authority. Governor Newsom vetoed the bill, citing the need for the state to maintain every tool at its disposal to reduce air and climate pollution.

Looking ahead: As federal efforts to weaken mobile-source regulations continue, California’s leadership will depend on leveraging its full suite of policy tools — including ISR — to advance clean, reliable, and equitable transportation decarbonization. Clarifying statewide authority to adopt ISR rules could enable the state to drive deeper emission reductions across transportation and industrial corridors, accelerate the deployment of zero-emission technologies, and deliver cleaner air for communities most affected by mobile source pollution.

Other Key Measures

The legislature also advanced several major measures with broad implications for reliability, affordability, and the state’s long-term energy transition.

Regional Grid Integration – AB 825 authorizes California’s participation in a western regional electricity market, paving the way for greater coordination across state lines. Regional integration is expected to enhance grid reliability, lower costs for ratepayers by hundreds of millions annually, and enable more efficient use of renewable and clean firm generation resources across the West. This marks an important step toward building the transmission and market structures needed for a decarbonized, resilient power system.

Refinery Transition – With two of California’s refineries announcing closure, concerns had been mounting regarding potential gasoline supply shortages that could increase prices at the pump. SB 237 (Grayson) sought to mitigate potential fuel supply disruptions and price volatility during the state’s clean energy transition. The bill streamlines permitting for certain in-state oil projects, authorizes the Governor to suspend summer-blend fuel requirements if gasoline prices rise sharply, and directs the California Energy Commission to study alternative fuel blends and explore a regional approach to stabilizing prices across western states. The measure underscores the complexity of sustaining climate progress while maintaining affordability.

The Path Forward

This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability. With landmark measures now on the books, the challenge ahead lies in implementation — translating statute into durable progress, sound regulation, and tangible results for households and businesses while sustaining momentum toward the state’s 2045 climate and energy goals.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10133250/california-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:54.594520

Businesses would also face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems.","Chicago– Attorney General Kwame Raoul, as part of a coalition of 15 attorneys general and two cities, filed a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to rescind the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program is designed to collect accurate and comprehensive data on greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial sources across the United States. Its primary purpose is to provide policymakers, businesses, researchers and the public with reliable information to track emissions trends and evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies.

“Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would jeopardize public health and the environment,” Raoul said. “This program is a longstanding source of reliable greenhouse gas emissions data that strengthens our nation’s competitiveness and allows policymakers to plan emissions reductions effectively. I join my fellow attorneys general in opposing this unlawful proposal.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009 by the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, following a congressional mandate. The program requires facilities releasing 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, along with suppliers of fossil fuels and certain industrial gases, to report their annual emissions. The program has been recognized as the most comprehensive national inventory of greenhouse gas data in the world, covering about 85% to 90% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This data has informed regulatory actions, corporate sustainability strategies and research on emissions trends across key economic sectors.

Last month, the EPA issued a Proposed Rule seeking to eliminate the program arguing that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to require emissions reporting and that the data collected isn’t necessary for any current or future federal rule or regulation.

Raoul and the coalition argue in their comment letter that the lack of emissions reporting could lead to higher greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to climate change, extreme weather events and ecosystem disruption. The coalition maintains that without emissions data, states would struggle to develop effective mitigation strategies, resulting in severe consequences for public health and the environment nationwide. Businesses would also face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems. The coalition asserts that the proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious and based on unexplained and unsupported changes in the EPA’s interpretation of its statutory authority.

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

To claim Section 45L credits in the 2025 tax year, apartments must be placed in service and leased or sold before Dec. 31, 2025.
Under the OBBBA, solar facilities must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027.
The ITC also benefits from the fact that solar credits, like Section 45L, do not reduce LIHTC basis under current law.
For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.","The window to pair affordable housing incentives with clean energy credits is narrowing, and developers of low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) properties face a pivotal period over the next 18 months. The Section 45L new energy efficient home credit, a valuable financing tool for housing developers which was substantially enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), now sunsets for housing acquired after June 30, 2026, as called for under H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

At the same time, the clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) for solar, under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 48E, is also on a compressed runway and under new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions. OBBBA requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027, and the supply chain for facilities financed must be heavily divested from China and other nations of concern by 2026 to secure the full value of the credit. For sponsors navigating lease-up schedules, financing timelines and rising construction costs, the multiple near-term deadlines present both a challenge and an opportunity.

Affordable housing developers still have opportunities to leverage Sections 45L and 48E credits, as well as the Low-Income Communities Bonus (LICB) program, but they must act quickly and proactively adapt or even pivot to meet new near-term deadlines for eligibility.

The Lease-Up Clock for Section 45L

The Section 45L effective date is based on when a unit is acquired, meaning the timing is driven by when the financed improvements are placed in service, and the housing is first leased or sold. For LIHTC developers, this timing sensitivity makes lease-up as important as physical construction. To claim Section 45L credits in the 2025 tax year, apartments must be placed in service and leased or sold before Dec. 31, 2025. If lease-up occurs after June 30, 2026, the credit disappears entirely. This creates pressure for sponsors to coordinate not only construction schedules but also leasing strategies that align with financing needs and equity adjusters.

The Inflation Reduction Act made Section 45L particularly attractive to affordable housing developers because it no longer reduces LIHTC basis when combined with the LIHTC. The Section 45L credit itself can range from $500 to $5,000 per unit, depending on whether developments meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR or U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Zero Energy Ready Home standards and whether prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The approaching sunset means that Section 45L qualification must be treated as a race against the calendar. Importantly, since Section 45L qualification is determined on a unit-by-unit basis, credits can be claimed for the proportion of Section 45L qualifying apartments that are leased up by June 30, 2026, even if all apartments on the property will not be leased at that time. For example, if 80% of the apartments are leased by the June 30, 2026, deadline, then the property owner can still claim 80% of the available Section 45L credits.

The ITC for Residential Solar as a Boost and a Backstop

While Section 45L is now only available through June 2026, small solar installations that qualify for the Section 48E ITC offer a critical backstop. Under the OBBBA, solar facilities must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. Developers that begin construction by the July 2026 deadline retain access to the four-year continuity safe harbor, allowing additional time to complete developments without losing eligibility.

For LIHTC properties, small on-site systems of 1.5 megawatts (MW) AC or less are particularly well positioned. According to new IRS guidance on beginning construction issued Aug. 15, Notice 2025-42, these systems can still rely on both the established 5% safe harbor test, achieved by incurring at least 5% of energy property costs before the deadline, or the physical work test. While the physical work test remains the same, requiring demonstrable progress on-site or through off-site fabrication under binding contracts, facilities will now need to more significantly demonstrate and document that construction has begun because of the administration and U.S. Department of the Treasury’s focus on stricter enforcement to prevent perceived circumventions. The result is that distributed solar remains one of the few asset classes where developers can choose their compliance path, an advantage in a market where interconnection and procurement delays are common.

The ITC also benefits from the fact that solar credits, like Section 45L, do not reduce LIHTC basis under current law. This allows developers to fully stack LIHTC equity, the ITC (with potential bonus credits such as the low-income communities bonus), and Section 45L where eligible. For developments where the Section 45L value is at risk because of timing, small photovoltaic systems can “backfill” the capital stack to an extent by providing alternative credits not tied to lease-up schedules and with a longer horizon.

The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program

The LICB program (also known as the Environmental Justice Solar and Wind Capacity Limitation) established by the IRA has been a particularly important tool for LIHTC properties leveraging small solar. Administered by the DOE and the IRS, the LICB program selects qualified solar or wind facilities under 5 MW serving low-income households, affordable housing or designated low-income census tracts up to 1.8 GWs in annual aggregate capacity (unused amounts may be carried forward). Awardees are then eligible to increase their ITC by an additional 10% or 20%.

The program is divided into four categories that cover facilities located in low-income communities or on Indian land (categories 1 and 2 respectively), low-income residential buildings (category 3), and low-income economic benefits projects (category 4). The 1.8 GWs are shared across the categories, plus unallocated capacity carried over from the previous year. In 2025, category 1 received an approximately 33% allocation, or 643.6 MWs; categories 2 and 3 each received approximately 12%, or 243.6 MWs; and category 4 received 43%, or 843.6 MWs, for a total of 1.974 GWs.

For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.

The challenge is uncertainty: while the 2025 application round remained active after the change in administration and the IRS program page remains active and still includes the annual awards schedule out to 2032, questions persist. It is unclear whether it will continue to be implemented in 2026 on time or at all given legislative changes, administrative delays, and the administration’s energy agenda and actions taken so far to stymie solar generation, in addition to wind.

Despite this uncertainty, developers should prepare: if the next allocation round proceeds as planned, housing and solar developers should be ready to submit applications as early as possible. The applications require detailed project information, interconnection status and documentation tying the facility to eligible communities. Because allocations are competitive, readiness at the time of application can determine whether a development secures the bonus.

Under the existing Biden-era schedule still provided on the IRS program page, the 2026 round will open Feb. 2, 2026, at 9 a.m. with the standard 30-day initial application window, which is set to close March 3. The rolling application period then closes Aug. 7 for all other applications outside of the initial 30-day window.

Documentation and Compliance Risks

The ability to claim these credits depends heavily on documentation. A solar developer should prepare for heightened scrutiny of beginning-of-construction evidence, whether relying on the 5% safe harbor or physical work, by creating and retaining extensive documentation including but not limited to binding contracts, invoices, fabrication logs, site photographs and interconnection applications to substantiate eligibility.

Developers will also need to prove compliance with FEOC restrictions on prohibited foreign entities and material assistance starting in 2026. Restrictions on material assistance up to the thresholds initially set in the OBBBA can be avoided by establishing that construction has begun prior to 2026, but the prohibition on prohibited entities as taxpayers goes into effect with minimal exemptions and safe harbors. Treasury has not yet issued guidance or regulations on how the restrictions will be implemented but developers can begin reasonably preparing by examining business and project structures based on what the legislation has laid out. While FEOC compliance will be the responsibility of the taxpayer that owns the solar facility, any developer that works with the solar taxpayer will need to be prepared as well to assist with due diligence.

Prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) compliance can also play a role. For multifamily developments, full Section 45L value is only available if wage requirements are met (the apprenticeship requirement does not apply to Section 45L), potentially adding costs but also significantly increasing the per-unit credit. While facilities less than 1 MW automatically qualify for the PWA credit step-up rate, if financing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or other federal financial assistance assists the property, this would trigger wage requirements. Facilities more than 1 MW must of course adhere to the requirements as required by Section 48E.

Developers must weigh these compliance obligations against the potential tax benefits and ensure that payroll and certification documentation is in place well before credits are claimed.

What Developers Should Do Now

For LIHTC sponsors, the strategic imperative is clear: accelerate lease-ups where possible to capture Section 45L credits before July 2026, while simultaneously advancing rooftop solar facilities that can secure ITC value. This dual approach provides a hedge against timing risk. If apartments are leased by June 30, 2026, Section 45L credits can be claimed; if lease-up slips, solar can still anchor the financing structure. Early coordination with investors and syndicators is vital, since equity adjusters may hinge on the year credits are recognized or when developments are placed in service.

Rooftop and carport arrays at LIHTC properties are strong candidates for LICB program awards, particularly category 3. Category 1 and 2 applicable facilities that are in low-income communities or on Indian land qualify for a 10% increase. Category 3 and 4 applicable facilities that are part of a qualified low-income residential building project or a qualified low-income economic benefit project are eligible for a 20% increase.

The LICB program, if accessed, can transform the economics of LIHTC developments with on-site solar. A 20% bonus layered on top of the base 30% ITC materially strengthens the case for including distributed solar, even in developments where Section 45L may slip away.

LIHTC and Residential Solar Resilience

Two clocks are ticking for affordable housing developers. The first is the Section 45L clock, which measures not just when developments are completed, but when housing is leased. The second is the ITC clock, which requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. While these deadlines create pressure and urgency, there are also opportunities.

The LICB program adds a third dimension. Its future may be uncertain, but the rewards for developers that prepare could be substantial. In a financing environment where every dollar counts, the difference between securing or missing a LICB allocation could reshape a development’s feasibility.

For developers willing to accelerate schedules, tighten documentation practices and integrate small solar into their developments, the near-term period represents a chance to capture substantial additional value without sacrificing LIHTC equity. Treat Section 45L as a race to lease-up, treat small solar as both a backstop and a catalyst, and treat the LICB program as a potential bonus too valuable to overlook. The next three to nine months will determine whether affordable housing properties leave millions of dollars on the table or seize the chance to strengthen financial resilience and energy security for decades to come.

By Yuan Gao / Bloomberg

Months before he dropped to the floor in agony while grocery shopping with his young son, Wang Peizhi (王培志) stayed up all night frantically preparing Xiaomi Corp’s flagship store for the launch of its first electric vehicle (EV).

Wang’s work had piled up after the company, led by billionaire cofounder Lei Jun (雷軍), unveiled a bold plan to become the first tech firm to successfully shift into automaking.

Lei, 55, staked his reputation on the transition, a feat even Apple Inc failed to achieve, vowing that it was his “last entrepreneurial project.”

A key part of executing that vision was Xiaomi’s retail network — Wang’s responsibility. To compete with the likes of BYD Co and Tesla Inc in China’s burgeoning EV market, the company had decided to overhaul its chain of retail outlets by converting stores designed for smartphones into showrooms to feature full-sized sedans and SUVs.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Xiaomi fired about half of the staff responsible for the effort, leaving about 10 people, according to a former employee and a current staff member, both of whom worked with Wang and asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.

The small team felt their workload sharply increase at the beginning of last year, when the company raced to roll out EV stores in time for the launch of its signature SU7 sedan, the people said.

Wang worked longer hours as he took on the team’s biggest projects in addition to his duties carrying out routine maintenance on the company’s web of stores, they said.

Plus, he was based in Xiaomi’s headquarters in Beijing, making him more visible to top company brass.

In the first eight months of the year, he worked on at least 267 retail stores, often retrofitting stores with an area for EVs, according to a trove of internal documents, photographs and WeChat messages reviewed by Bloomberg News.

On Aug. 25 last year, less than three days after he collapsed in front of his son, he died of a heart attack at the age of 34.

Local authorities ruled that Wang’s death was not related to his job at Xiaomi, but his widow is convinced that his punishing work schedule contributed to his death.

“He was treated just like a leaf: When it falls, people step on it without noticing its existence,” Luna Liu told Bloomberg News.

She agreed to speak publicly for the first time since his death because she thinks his case deserves more attention. She also shared thousands of her late husband’s work-related WeChat messages out of concern that Chinese companies push their employees too hard, with little regard for their health and welfare.

Xiaomi had given Wang more responsibility because he took his duties so seriously. He was in charge of some of the company’s most high-profile projects, including its flagship showroom just off Tiananmen Square. He still had dozens of other projects to manage at the same time.

Wang’s motivation for working long hours is complicated. People close to him said he felt a strong sense of obligation and would take on tasks himself because there was not anyone else who could share his duties. He also drove himself hard, keeping track of hundreds of projects and grinding for hours to make sure he delivered on what the company needed.

He was paid well by Chinese standards, bringing home about 600,000 yuan (US$84,000) a year, including stock options, according to his widow.

However, he lived under “immense mental strain” because he was caught between the demands of top company leaders and the realities on the ground, she said.

“He was sandwiched between his bosses and the stores whenever there was an issue with one of the projects,” she said.

In response to a detailed request for comment from Bloomberg News, a spokesperson for Xiaomi said: “We are deeply saddened by the unfortunate passing of our colleague and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. At the same time, we do our utmost to provide support and assistance to our colleague’s family under the applicable laws and regulations.”

Xiaomi is not the only company pushing its employees to work long hours. Staff across China’s tech sector complain that they spend all their time at the office. Several told Bloomberg News that overwork — defined by the WHO as more than 55 hours a week — is prevalent in many top firms.

Wang’s story offers a rare glimpse of the enormous pressure inside China’s tech companies. One reason is a renewed urgency to stay competitive in China’s increasingly crowded market, where battles for customers in sectors from EVs to e-commerce are red hot. Rivalry with the US in semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) has also brought the culture to some state-affiliated companies.

Excessive work culture, dubbed “996” for the expectation to be in the office from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, is deeply rooted in China’s tech sector.

A decade ago, it was driven by the belief that hard work would reap rewards as rapid economic growth created opportunities, according to Mary Gallagher, a professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

Now, it is more about national priorities and a sense of patriotic duty as China competes in chips, AI and EVs.

“These industries that are doing so well — including on export markets — and are so important to the confidence that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping [習近平] wants to see in the economy,” said Gallagher, the author of Authoritarian Legality in China: Law, Workers, and the State.

“There’s enormous pressure in those places,” she said.

Lei’s pivot to EVs began with an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, followed by massive spending on nearly every corner of the supply chain, from batteries and chips to air suspension and sensors.

In all, it pumped more than US$1.6 billion into more than 100 suppliers from 2021 to last year, according to data compiled by Chinese analytics firm Zhangtongshe and Bloomberg.

As EV production was ramping up at the beginning of last year, company leadership also turned their attention to boosting sales. Two months before Xiaomi launched the SU7, Wang took on even more work. He was sending WeChat messages to colleagues from early in the morning to late at night, with some of them sent from his home. On one particularly long day at the end of January last year, he asked about the installation of mirrors at an outlet at about 2:30am. A few hours later, he pressed a furniture supplier to finish a project five times faster than originally quoted.

“At one point he was shouldering the workload of seven or eight people. He said he was busy like a spinning top,” Liu said. “Many times I told him: ‘Although you come back home every day, sometimes I feel I haven’t seen you for days.’”

After the Lunar New Year holiday in February last year, Wang worked at a relentless pace, exchanging hundreds of photos and messages with colleagues about the flagship showroom in Beijing, according to the collection of documents reviewed by Bloomberg.

As the location neared completion at the end of March, Wang spent all night there, toiling to fix the lighting system and charging poles in the basement. He also raced to get the floor reinforced after finding it had cracked under the weight of a car.

One evening, Xiaomi president Lu Weibing (盧偉冰) announced in a post on Chinese social media that he would make a long-awaited visit to the flagship store in Beijing the next morning. After sharing the news with a colleague, Wang worried about getting the showroom ready at short notice.

“Tomorrow decides everything,” he wrote on WeChat.

His hard work paid off: About two weeks later, Lei lauded the flagship location as “one of the most iconic among our 59 stores nationwide.”

The SU7 launch in March last year catapulted Xiaomi into China’s EV market.

Costing 215,900 yuan, it comes in below the 219,800 yuan asking price for a BYD Han L and the 235,500 yuan price tag of a Tesla Model 3. The Porsche Taycan — the vehicle to which the SU7 bears an uncanny resemblance — starts at about US$100,000.

Since the unveiling, Xiaomi’s stock has soared about 200 percent in Hong Kong, but the company still has a long way to go before it could break into the elite club of automakers. It has set a delivery target of 350,000 units this year, up from its previous goal of 300,000. By comparison, China’s top car brand, BYD Co, sold about 4.3 million EVs and hybrids last year, many overseas, while Tesla moved about 1.8 million vehicles globally.

Xiaomi has “democratized technology” and created an image that has resonated well with Chinese consumers, said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive officer of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

“Xiaomi is a known consumer brand that makes technology affordable and that’s been their value prop from the beginning for virtually every device that they manufacture,” Russo said. “Lei Jun is kind of a rock star in the perception of the Chinese consumer.”

In the past few years, China has been gripped by a national debate over the need to improve work-life balance. Social media platforms such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu have been flooded with posts — which are impossible to verify — about long working hours. The topic took on greater importance in the past few years following a series of high-profile deaths attributed to overwork, with the Chinese Communist Party voicing its support for protecting the rights of workers.

Work culture appeared to improve during the pandemic, when some tech staff were allowed to work flexible hours. The Chinese government also rolled out some efforts to improve working environments in an attempt to beat back the public outcry following a series of deaths attributed to overwork. Public officials held discussions and announced plans to improve working situations.

In 2021, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into working conditions at e-commerce company PDD Holdings Inc following the death of an employee in her early 20s. The employee collapsed while walking home with colleagues. Her death sparked a social media backlash against PDD and the relentless working schedules expected of its workers. The following year, a content moderator at Bilibili Inc, China’s largest anime streaming site, died from a brain hemorrhage.

Both companies have denied wrongdoing.

Neither PDD nor Bilibili responded to requests for comment.

China’s national labor laws cap standard working time at 44 hours per week, but employers can negotiate with trade unions and employees to extend that. Figures from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that staff at Chinese companies have worked longer hours in the past few years. Last year, the average workweek totaled 49 hours with no break, up slightly from 47.9 in 2022.

Full-time employees in the US last year worked an average of 43 hours a week, according to a Gallup survey.

This year, the Chinese government released an action plan to “regulate the unwholesome work culture,” pushing provincial governments to take a greater role in preventing excessive hours.

“Local authorities are urged to better protect workers’ rights to rest and tighten supervision over employers’ behaviors of illegally lengthening employees’ working hours without permission,” the state-owned China Daily reported in March.

However, the problem has not gone away.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s engineers canceled vacations and worked through this year’s Lunar New Year holiday to play catch up after DeepSeek shocked the global tech industry with its low-cost, powerful AI model in January.

PDD, locked in a price war with Alibaba and JD.com, also made some staff cancel their holiday plans during the same period.

It offered overtime bonuses to those who stayed behind to keep its Web site running, said one employee in Shanghai, who asked for anonymity to discuss their schedule.

The employee, in her mid-30s, said that she received a bonus of about 3,000 yuan after working four days during the holidays.

Alibaba and PDD did not respond to requests for comment.

Another engineer, at Shanghai-based chip equipment maker Ueascend, said that he was only able to take one day off per week since he joined the company last year.

Team calls were sometimes scheduled on the few days he had off, and when urgent projects came in, he would work from morning until 11pm for days, said the 25-year-old, who also asked for anonymity to talk about their working hours.

Staff at drone maker DJI and Apple supplier Desay Battery also claimed poor working conditions.

Bloomberg News was unable to reach Ueascend.

Desay Battery did not respond to requests for comment.

A DJI spokesperson said that its staff work an average of nine hours per day and regularly get a two-day weekend.

In April, Chinese media reported that Xiaomi was requiring employees to work at least 11.5 hours a day, with those who worked less than eight hours were told to submit a formal explanation.

Xiaomi did not respond to questions about the media reports.

A survey published last year by Chinese job hunting platform Maimai showed that Xiaomi workers averaged 11.5 hours a day, among the most in the country’s tech industry.

Staff at ByteDance Ltd. Meituan and Tencent Holdings Ltd all clocked double-digit hours, according to the survey, which did not explain its methodology.

In the US, the average workday spanned 8 hours and 44 minutes, with just 5 percent of employees working on weekends, according to data from workforce analytics company ActivTrak.

ByteDance declined to comment, while Meituan and Tencent did not respond to questions from Bloomberg News.

Wang’s long hours did not go unnoticed. He was praised by his bosses for expanding Xiaomi’s network of EV showrooms, according to his internal performance review, which covered the first half of last year.

The company credited him with rolling out new stores “at a unified standard, with high efficiency and quality,” the review said.

In the weeks leading up to his death in August last year, Wang worked on at least 80 stores, according to his WeChat messages.

Most of the sites he visited were in Beijing, but he kept a frantic schedule, criss-crossing northeastern China.

Only two team members were available to help him with a broad range of tasks that included renovation as well as supplier management and accounting, according to one of the former colleagues.

During a three-day trip at the beginning of the month that he died, he visited at least 14 Xiaomi outlets in Harbin, Changchun and Shenyang. He made his last business trip on Aug. 20 last year, visiting at least three stores in Tianjin, about 30 minutes from Beijing by train or a 1.5-hour drive.

On Aug. 22, Wang felt so weak he called in sick and went to a hospital for medical checks. While there, he received dozens of WeChat messages from staff at about five different outlets. He told a store manager in Shenyang that he was sick and someone else would visit his projects that day.

“Xiaomi’s employees are all warriors,” the manager replied, encouraging Wang to get better and including a crying facepalm emoji.

The work exchanges lasted until at least 4pm. Later that day, he took the trip with his son to a grocery store. There, his heart seized up, briefly stopping the flow of blood to his brain, and he slumped to the floor.

He was rushed to an intensive care unit by ambulance, his widow said.

Less than three days later he was dead.

Bloomberg News reviewed a copy of Wang’s death certificate that listed acute myocardial infarction — commonly known as a heart attack — as the cause of his death.

Wang was in good health at the time of his death, had no pre-existing conditions and maintained an active lifestyle, his widow said.

He underwent regular annual physical exams, but missed his appointment last year because of a scheduling conflict, she said.

He would spend his time off with his family, going on hikes in the mountains around Beijing and accompanying his son to extracurricular activities, she and a colleague said.

He regularly went on 5km runs to ease the stress of his job, another colleague said.

Wang’s widow told Xiaomi that she believed her husband had died from excessive work.

The company reported the incident to local authorities, which determined that Wang’s death was not work related.

According to Chinese guidelines, an employee is deemed to have had a work-related death only if they die within 48 hours of receiving treatment for an injury sustained on the job.

The Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.

Xiaomi denied any wrongdoing.

It offered the family 50,000 yuan as a hardship payment, but no funds were paid out, Liu said.

The company helped her access her husband’s investment portfolio, but later rescinded some of his stock options, she added.

Days after her husband passed away, Liu took to Sina Weibo to address Xiaomi’s boss directly.

“I hope Mr Lei can take a look at employee Wang Peizhi’s sudden death,” she wrote. “My husband contributed to the success of Xiaomi’s EVs. He was so tired because of too much pressure from work.”

Her posts gained little traction, with some people commenting that she was just seeking additional compensation from Xiaomi.

By the end of the year, she stopped using Sina Weibo.

“It’s okay if I was misunderstood or insulted, but the company still owes me an apology,” she wrote in one of her final posts.

Within Xiaomi, Wang’s death was not widely reported, two of his former colleagues said.

Zhang Jian (張建), a Xiaomi executive in charge of nationwide stores at the time, hosted an internal meeting about Wang’s death, according to the current employee.

He told colleagues that Wang had died from a heart attack and the company was talking to his family.

No changes to the team’s working hours were made.

Zhang has been promoted to head the company’s EV sales in China.

These days, the workload at the company varies by department.

On Wang’s former team, tasks usually pile up at the end of the month, the current employee said.

Another current Xiaomi employee who works on a different team in Beijing said they usually work between 50 and 60 hours per week and rarely go in on weekends.

A separate staffer on the company’s smartphone research team said they work more than 50 hours per week, including occasional hours on Saturday and Sunday.

Wang’s widow said he left his family with debts totaling about 4 million yuan, including the mortgage on their house.

His life insurance policy, provided by Xiaomi, disbursed a one-time payment of about 800,000 yuan.

At home in Beijing, she has tried to piece together the memories of her late husband by organizing his WeChat chat logs — most of which are related to his work.

However, she does not have access to a separate app he used for internal Xiaomi messages, leaving the full picture of his job responsibilities unknown.

What she is sure of is that she did not see her husband often during his final months.

“The work took all his time when he was needed as a father, as a husband,” she said, adding that Wang rarely returned home before 9pm and even then his phone kept buzzing with work messages.

“Almost every time he came back from work, our son was either already asleep or just about to go to bed,” she said.

One of the last messages Wang sent was a desperate plea for a contractor to work faster.

“What I signed up for was a life or death commitment,” Wang wrote. “Don’t leave me hanging.”",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/11/05/p07-251105-hkje.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:40.455996

Over two dozen electricity grid improvement initiatives — some aimed at adding new power capacity — were canceled, fueling concerns about potential increases in electricity prices.

Reports also indicate internal disagreements within DOE leadership over many of the project cuts, with the result that Undersecretary of Energy Wells Griffith was replaced on an acting basis by Alex Fitzsimmons, who is also serving as the Director of the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.

The fate of the remaining $22 billion in DOE-funded projects, many of which would benefit Republican-leaning regions, remains uncertain.

Critical Minerals

New International Initiatives

On October 23, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) launched a Critical Mineral Consortium (CMC) with Orion Resource Partners and the Abu Dhabi–based ADQ, committing $1.8 billion toward a targeted $5 billion fund to finance mineral projects in emerging markets. The initiative aims to strengthen allied supply chains through investment, offtake management, domestic processing, and technology scaling.

Following China’s restrictions on rare earth exports, US officials signaled plans to expand investment in African mining and refining operations. Wayne Wall, Senior Director for Middle East and Africa Affairs at the National Security Council, said the administration aims to leverage financing from the DFC and Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to offer African nations an alternative to Chinese-backed infrastructure and mining deals.

In Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced an amended version of the bipartisan Critical Minerals Partnership Act (S. 2550), sponsored by Senators John Curtis (R-UT) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). The bill authorizes $50 million for FY2026 to bolster global mineral supply chain security, empower the State Department’s Minerals Security Partnership to coordinate investments, and support the creation of a database of critical mineral projects to attract private-sector participation. It further underscores governance standards, recycling, joint financing, and risk insurance mechanisms for mining ventures.

US-Australia Critical Minerals Alliance and Investments

Complementing these efforts, the United States and Australia agreed on October 20 to a nonbinding framework to deepen cooperation in critical minerals mining, processing, and supply. Each country pledged at least $1 billion in new project financing to secure mineral supply chains vital to clean energy and defense. The agreement also establishes a joint response group to identify vulnerabilities and expedite mineral deliveries. Simultaneously, EXIM announced seven letters of interest totaling more than $2.2 billion to advance US critical minerals projects in Australia, including rare earth elements, graphite, magnesium, titanium, and scandium. Six of the seven projects are being pursued in partnership with Export Finance Australia (EFA) under the EXIM-EFA “Single Point of Entry” framework, demonstrating allied cooperation to counter China’s export dominance and ensure Western supply-chain resilience.

Critical Minerals Investment and Project Approval

Earlier in October, the White House announced that the Department of War would take a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Vancouver-based mining company with claims in northwest Alaska. The Department of the Interior also reissued right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project — a 211-mile corridor designed to unlock access to Alaska’s mineral deposits. Both actions were framed as advancing national security and revitalizing domestic mining capacity to reduce US dependence on China.

Also, at the beginning of November, Vulcan Elements announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to establish a fully domestic, vertically-integrated rare-earth magnet supply‐chain capable of producing 10,000 metric tons annually and recycling end-of-life magnets and e-waste. Subject to due diligence and final agreement, the financing structure includes a $620 million direct loan from the Office of Strategic Capital and $50 million of federal incentives via the CHIPS and Science Act. This marks the first time CHIPS Act authority has been used to support critical-minerals or rare earth investment, underscoring a strategic shift toward domestic supply-chain security for magnets used in advanced defense and non-defense sectors.

LPO Is Now the Energy Dominance Financing Program

On October 16, Secretary Chris Wright announced that the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) has been rebranded as the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program, keeping with the new authority granted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July. Its first project under this new designation — a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to an American Electric Power (AEP) subsidiary — will fund the reconductoring and rebuilding of approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Secretary Wright indicated that the administration will continue utilizing the EDF for projects originally proposed under the Biden administration, noting, “As we’re reviewing these things, of course, not all of them were nonsense.” While not the strong words of support all applicants were looking for, this shows that the EDF Program (formerly LPO) is open for business, a good sign for projects that align with the administration’s objectives.

Following Secretary Wright’s announcement, DOE issued an Interim Final Rule amending DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA, which amended Section 1706 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans of up to a total principal amount of $250 billion through September 30, 2028. The rule replaces the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) framework established under the Inflation Reduction Act with a significantly broader lending authority and mandate, revising Part 609 to define “energy infrastructure” to mean “a facility, and associated equipment, used for enabling the identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.” DOE is also revising Part 609 to reflect OBBBA’s elimination of the application requirement to “include an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities.” DOE is providing a comment period until December 29, 2025.

Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC)

On October 23, the Energy Secretary invoked a rarely used provision of the Department of Energy Organization Act, directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a preliminary Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on reforms to improve the timeliness and efficiency of interconnecting large energy loads to the transmission grid. Read more about this update from our Mintz colleagues here.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration officially appointed Laura Swett as FERC Chair on October 20, following her swearing-in ceremony. Swett’s elevation, which follows the White House’s earlier push for former Democratic Chair Willie Phillips to resign, gives Republicans a majority on the Commission and renews scrutiny of FERC’s political independence.

Fusion Commercialization Roadmaps

A number of studies outlining the path and impact of fusion commercialization were rolled out during the month. On October 16, DOE’s Office of Science released its Fusion Science & Technology Roadmap, outlining a federal strategy to build the infrastructure and partnerships necessary for commercial fusion energy scale-up in the 2030s. The Roadmap identifies 10 key actions across three pillars — Build, Innovate, and Grow — focused on closing gaps in materials and technology, advancing scientific research, and expanding the US fusion ecosystem through public-private and international collaboration. The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)–led Commission on the Scaling of Fusion Energy also released their culminating report, “Fusion Forward: Powering America’s Future,” underscoring the imperative to declare fusion energy a national security priority, expand fusion leadership, and inject $10 billion to drive commercialization.

Mintz and ML Strategies continue to play an active role in this space, supporting the launch of Catalyzing California’s Fusion Advantage: Roadmap to Commercialization, a study led by General Atomics and released by the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC). The report examines the economic potential and growth trajectory of California’s emerging fusion energy sector.

In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008.
General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion.
Jacobson added that the focus would go more into cost reductions for electric vehicles, instead of making the lineup larger.
Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.","For a few years, it looked like the American automotive industry would slowly move away from internal combustion engines, and focus instead on electric vehicles. In August of 2024, American manufacturer General Motors told EV Magazine they were planning for a future comprised entirely of electric cars. That included an investment of $35 billion to phase out gas and diesel vehicles by 2035. More recently, Ford announced a $5 billion plan to create a lineup of affordable electric vehicles.

However, the tide may be turning back toward internal combustion engines and away from batteries. In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008. The announcement came just two months before the legislation was to take effect, and in that time, there was a massive jump in EV sales. Unfortunately, that jump in sales is starting to feel gravity as the tax credits are no longer available.

General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion. GM claimed that $1.2 billion of the losses came from ""adjustments to [GM's] EV capacity.""

As of right now, it means that the brand will slow down its electric vehicle production and research. Paul Jacobson, General Motors Chief Financial Officer, stated in September 2025 that although profitability needs scale, scaling up would go a little slower over the coming years.

Now, this doesn't mean that GM will eliminate its electric vehicle division entirely, as the brand has already invested a ton in EVs. Jacobson did mention seeing the bright side of this situation though, saying that GM will make a commitment to bringing down the price of its current EV lineup. Jacobson added that the focus would go more into cost reductions for electric vehicles, instead of making the lineup larger.

This slow down in EV production will also affect plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the American brand had been building batteries in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

It's not just General Motors who has to figure out a workaround for the elimination of the EV tax credits, as it affects every other automaker as well. Hyundai recently cut the price of one of its most popular vehicles, the Ioniq 5, by nearly $10,000 in some of the upper trim levels. Ford is also in the same boat, as we mentioned earlier, and it plans on offering 0% financing lease deals on its EVs.

Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, is currently offering its EVs at a $7,500 discount, the same amount that the federal tax credit offered. Tesla did something similar, although the discount placed on its vehicles is less than what the tax credit offered.

Honda and Acura don't offer many EVs in North America, just the Prologue and the related Acura ZDX, although Acura nixed production of the ZDX recently. Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/gm-takes-a-1-6b-hit-after-fed-reverses-on-evs/l-intro-1761900742.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:46.048007

As noted by MPP Lisa Thompson: “The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean-energy future.","With up to 4,800 megawatts of additional capacity proposed, the Bruce C Project (currently undergoing a federal Impact Assessment) would bring Bruce Power’s total generation capacity to around 12,000 MW — making it the largest nuclear generator in the world.

Interim findings of a report indicate that, during construction, the project could support approximately 20,000 jobs annually; over its lifetime, it is projected to maintain an average of 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs across Canada (around 10,000 of these in Ontario). It is estimated to contribute nearly CAD $200 billion to Canada’s GDP (about CAD $172 billion in Ontario) and tens of billions of tax revenue for all levels of government.

Bruce Power already stands out as Canada’s largest public-private partnership; its current Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project are the country’s largest privately financed electricity infrastructure endeavours. These existing operations support around 27,000 direct and indirect jobs each year. The Bruce C Project would build on that foundation, bringing new chances for skilled employment, regional economic development and durable prosperity in Ontario communities.

Currently, 95 % of Bruce Power’s spending is domestic, via an Ontario-based supply chain. The Bruce C Project would further that “Canadian at our Core” strategy — committing to safe and reliable power, global medical isotope production, economic growth and stronger Indigenous partnerships.

As stated by Stephen Lecce, Ontario’s Minister of Energy and Mines: “Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the best of Canadian technology, resources and workers… The Bruce C Project will support jobs, add CAD $200 billion to the Canadian economy, and expand Ontario’s leadership in life-saving medical isotope production…”

Together with the potential refurbishment of Bruce Power’s Units 1 and 2, the Bruce C Project would enhance the already significant economic contributions of the Bruce Power site (which currently delivers about CAD $4 billion annually to the province via ongoing operations and life-extension activities). This supports Ontario’s ambition to become an energy superpower.

As noted by MPP Lisa Thompson: “The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean-energy future. By expanding nuclear capacity in Bruce County, we’re not only advancing energy security but also driving innovation, job creation and long-term prosperity across Ontario and beyond.”

Bruce Power COO and Executive VP James Scongack noted: “We’re proud of the work we do each and every day … and we’re proving that large-scale projects can be completed safely and on plan…” Further, the involvement of local residents, Indigenous partners and municipalities is promised to ensure that benefits materialize where they matter most — in the region of Bruce, Grey and Huron counties.",https://www.foronuclear.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_965524740-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:11.614423

Ahead of the agreement’s 2026 joint review, coalitions across sectors submitted comments demanding urgent reforms to address the USMCA’s flaws, including corporate giveaways, insufficient labor and environmental protections and enforcement, and rules that fuel displacement and undermine human rights.

Cross-Sector Demands

105 members of Congress, led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), endorsed a comment calling for substantial changes to the USMCA, including stronger protections for U.S. workers, consumers, small businesses, and farmers, improved enforcement mechanisms for labor and environmental standards, and the removal of rules that undermine sovereignty, access to medicines, Big Tech regulation, and more.

The issues highlighted in their letter mirrored demands by more than 700 organizations and more than 23,000 individuals who signed onto a comment co-sponsored by the Citizens Trade Campaign and a dozen other organizations.

Public Citizen submitted a detailed comment demanding a complete overhaul of the agreement, with special focus on removing the deal’s terms that benefit Big Tech and Big Pharma at the expense of the rest of us.

Access to Affordable Medicines

Public health organizations, including Médecins Sans Frontières USA, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, Public Citizen, and Health GAP, joined with unions – such as the Communications Workers of America and National Nurses United as well as faith groups like NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice – to call for the elimination of USMCA intellectual property rules that keep drug prices high, including patent term extensions, market exclusivity, and patent linkage.

Migrant Justice and Human Rights

Migrant rights organizations, including the National Partnership for New Americans, LULAC, and LCLAA, urged trade policy reforms to address displacement, exploitation, and inequality driven by decades of corporate-driven trade. They called for USMCA revisions that prioritize human rights, fair wages, climate resilience, and inclusive policymaking.

Centro de los Derechos del Migrante called for the agreement’s protections for migrant workers to be maintained, strengthened, and enforced, particularly for migrant women workers. They also advised that labor enforcement provisions be expanded to apply to facilities in the U.S. and Canada as well as Mexico.

Workers’ Rights

The Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) – a panel of USTR-cleared advisers including the AFL-CIO, the United Steelworkers, the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters, and more – warned that offshoring, job losses, and wage suppression persist under the USMCA. The committee called for renegotiation before any extension of the agreement’s 16-year term, with stronger labor enforcement, tighter rules of origin, and restored country-of-origin labeling for food.

Nearly 70 members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, led by Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Donald Norcross (D-N.J.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) recommended pressuring Mexico to raise wages and labor standards; strengthening and expanding the USMCA’s labor “rapid response mechanism,” ensuring both Canada and Mexico fully enforce a ban on goods made with forced labor, and addressing transshipment from China.

Environment and Corporate Tribunals

Leading environmental organizations, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, National Resources Defense Council, and Industrious Labs, called for revisions to the USMCA that support green and union jobs and clean water and air. Revisions including binding and enforceable environmental standards, a full elimination of ISDS that undermines labor and environmental safeguards, and a new tri-national body to tackle air pollution, and more.

BlueGreen Alliance, a powerful coalition of labor and environmental organizations, shared key provisions needed to support industrial resilience, clean manufacturing, and high-road labor and environmental standards.

Right to Repair

A collection of small-business, consumer, and digital organizations explained how certain USMCA provisions undermine governmental tools to support consumers’ right to repair. American Economic Liberties Project, Center for Democracy & Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, FULU Foundation, iFixit, Re: Create Coalition, The Repair Association, and U.S. PIRG recommended revising or removing terms that make it harder for people to fix the products they own.

In the short term (late 2025 - 2026), Parex anticipates robust production growth, with Q4 2025 average production expected to surpass its annual guidance.","Calgary, AB – Parex Resources (TSX: PXT) has reported a robust performance for the third quarter of 2025, coupled with an impressive surge in October 2025 production, signaling a potential turning point for the company amidst a volatile energy commodity market. While year-on-year financial comparisons indicate a more challenging environment than the previous year, the recent operational successes highlight the company's resilience and strategic execution, providing a nuanced outlook for investors and the broader energy sector.

The strong operational momentum, particularly the significant increase in October production to 49,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), positions Parex for a strong close to 2025 and an optimistic start to 2026. This performance, driven by key assets and successful exploration, suggests that well-managed independent producers can still thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted growth, even as the global energy landscape grapples with wavering demand and price volatility.

Detailed Coverage: Parex Navigates Market Headwinds with Operational Acumen

Parex Resources Inc. (TSX: PXT) showcased a mixed but ultimately promising third quarter for 2025. The company generated funds flow from operations (FFO) of $105 million, translating to $1.09 per share, and recorded a net income of $50 million. Despite these solid figures, a year-on-year analysis reveals a decrease, with FFO per share dropping from $1.50 and net income declining by 23%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also experienced a 32% year-on-year decline, totaling $113.6 million, reflecting the broader economic pressures and commodity price fluctuations faced by the industry compared to the previous year. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $80.0 million, a slight decrease of 2.9% year-on-year, indicating disciplined spending.

The operational front, however, tells a story of significant momentum. Parex reported an average production of 43,953 boe/d for Q3 2025, marking a 3% increase from Q2 2025. More notably, October 2025 production surged to an average of 49,300 boe/d, exceeding the company's full-year 2025 guidance range of 43,000 to 47,000 boe/d. This impressive ramp-up is largely attributed to the LLA-32 block, where production rates have more than tripled to over 12,000 boe/d following a strategic tuck-in acquisition. Additionally, successful exploration at LLA-74 saw five producing wells brought online in 2025 with a 75% success rate, further bolstering output.

The company's strategic initiatives extend to future growth, with drilling initiated on the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at the VIM-1 block, with preliminary results expected by year-end 2025. This forward-looking approach, combined with strong performance from existing base assets and plans to bring four to six additional production-adding wells online in Q4 across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo, sets a robust foundation for continued growth into 2026. While overall crude oil production saw a 9.2% year-on-year decline, a significant 93% increase in natural gas production, reaching 8.41 million cubic feet per day, highlights a strategic diversification in Parex's energy portfolio. In a move to return value to shareholders, Parex also declared a Q4 2025 regular dividend of C$0.385 per share, annualizing to C$1.54 per share, alongside maintaining its share buyback program.

Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic, with analysts acknowledging the strong operational execution despite the challenging financial comparisons. The company's robust balance sheet and attractive valuation metrics are seen as strengths, though some analysts express a desire for sustained financial performance to drive a market rerating. This balance between operational success and financial prudence positions Parex as a key player to watch in the evolving energy commodity landscape as of early November 2025.

Market Ripples: Winners and Losers in the Wake of Parex's Success

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) robust Q3 2025 results and impressive October 2025 production figures are poised to send ripples across the energy sector, creating both direct benefits for partners and heightened competitive pressure for other players, particularly those operating in Colombia's prolific basins or with similar exploration and production (E&P) profiles.

A clear beneficiary of Parex's strong performance is Ecopetrol S.A. (BVC: ECOPETROL), Colombia's state-owned oil company and a key strategic partner. Parex and Ecopetrol have active collaboration agreements, notably in the Putumayo Basin and the Llanos Foothills. Increased production and operational efficiency from Parex in these joint ventures directly translate to higher shared revenues and de-risked projects for Ecopetrol. This success not only validates their investment strategies in these areas but also fosters confidence for future collaborative ventures, potentially accelerating development across their shared portfolio.

On the other hand, several competitors face increased scrutiny and pressure. GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), a significant Latin American E&P player, finds itself in a particularly precarious position. Parex's continued strong performance intensifies the spotlight on GeoPark, especially after its board rejected an all-cash acquisition proposal from Parex in September 2025, deeming it an undervaluation. With Parex having acquired an 11.8% ownership stake in GeoPark, the pressure is mounting for GeoPark to demonstrate its ability to deliver superior shareholder value from its existing assets and recent expansion into Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin, to justify its rejection and ward off further advances.

Other independent producers with significant Colombian operations, such as Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC) and Gran Tierra Energy (NYSE: GTE), are also likely to feel the heat. While Frontera Energy has previously engaged in farm-in agreements with Parex, including for the VIM-1 block where Parex is currently drilling a high-impact exploration well, the outcome of such ventures will determine its direct benefit. More broadly, Parex's operational efficiencies and exploration successes in areas like LLA-32 and LLA-74 set a high benchmark, compelling Frontera and Gran Tierra to demonstrate comparable growth and efficiency in their own operations to maintain investor confidence and market share. Gran Tierra, in particular, has faced challenges including production declines and blockades, which Parex's sustained performance could starkly highlight in contrast. Even Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE), a prominent natural gas producer, could experience indirect pressure as Parex expands its natural gas opportunities, increasing competition for resources and investor capital within the Colombian energy sector.

Wider Significance: A Barometer for the Energy Sector's Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) impressive Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures emerge as a compelling narrative within a global energy commodities landscape marked by complexity and often, contradiction. This strong showing offers critical insights into broader industry trends, competitive dynamics, evolving regulatory frameworks, and echoes historical patterns in the energy sector.

Parex's success stands out against a backdrop of global oil market softness. Forecasts for Brent crude in 2025 and 2026 indicate a decline from previous highs, primarily driven by global oil production outpacing demand, with a significant surplus projected. Factors such as the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles and flattening demand in major economies like China contribute to this softening. Despite these overarching pressures, Parex's ability to boost output and maintain its full-year guidance underscores the potential for well-managed, agile independent producers to thrive through operational efficiency, strategic asset management, and targeted exploration, even when larger market forces exert downward pressure on prices. The nuanced global natural gas market, with slowing demand growth but increasing LNG supply and new discoveries, also frames Parex's increasing natural gas production as a timely strategic diversification.

The ripple effects of Parex's performance extend to the broader competitive landscape. As the largest independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained growth intensifies competition for acreage, resources, and investor capital against peers such as Ecopetrol (BVC: ECOPETROL), Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC), GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), and Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE). Parex's strong financial health and production growth also bolster its capacity for strategic acquisitions, exemplified by its recent proposal to acquire GeoPark, potentially leading to increased market consolidation and operational synergies within the region. Furthermore, its enhanced strategic partnership with Ecopetrol, including joint exploration in areas like the Farallones Block, signals a positive trajectory for future collaborations and shared development opportunities, benefiting the broader Colombian energy supply chain through increased demand for services and equipment.

Operating in Colombia, Parex navigates an evolving regulatory environment characterized by both challenges and opportunities. The Colombian government's pursuit of an energy transition agenda, including a halt on new exploration licensing rounds and increased taxes on producers since August 2022, reflects a broader ""resource nationalism agenda."" This policy shift has contributed to investor uncertainty and a decline in foreign direct investment. However, recognizing a looming natural gas supply shortfall by early 2026, Colombian lawmakers are debating measures to ease LNG import rules and offer tax breaks for critical infrastructure. These policy adjustments, alongside positive changes like allowing pipelines to carry both oil and gas, demonstrate a dynamic regulatory landscape where the government attempts to balance energy transition goals with the immediate need for energy security.

Historically, Parex's performance resonates with several recurring themes in the energy industry. The company's growth amidst broader market fluctuations mirrors the inherent boom-and-bust cycles of the oil and gas sector, highlighting the imperative for companies to prioritize efficiency and strategic investment to weather potential downturns. Sustained growth in specific regions, driven by significant production, can also evoke historical precedents of regional economic impacts, akin to ""boomtown"" phenomena, bringing both prosperity and challenges like strained infrastructure. Moreover, Colombia's current policy stance on resource nationalism finds parallels in historical instances where nations sought greater control and benefit from their natural resources, often leading to complex negotiations and, at times, investor-state disputes. Parex's ability to maintain growth within this framework serves as a case study for navigating such nationalistic shifts.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Energy

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures set a dynamic stage for its immediate future and offer a compelling case study for the broader energy commodity market. The company is poised for continued growth in the short term, but its long-term trajectory will be significantly influenced by global commodity price trends, geopolitical stability, and the accelerating energy transition.

In the short term (late 2025 - 2026), Parex anticipates robust production growth, with Q4 2025 average production expected to surpass its annual guidance. This momentum will be driven by successful exploration and development at key blocks like LLA-32 and LLA-74, and the potential transformational impact of the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, with results expected by year-end. The company's disciplined capital expenditure, focused on high-return development and exploitation, underscores its commitment to sustaining this growth while maintaining shareholder returns through consistent dividends.

Looking at the long term (beyond 2026), Parex aims to solidify its position as Colombia's largest independent E&P company, expanding its multi-field operator status and achieving sustainable production growth across its diversified portfolio, including the Llanos and Magdalena basins, and the newly acquired Putumayo blocks. Strategic initiatives like enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, such as polymer injection at LLA-34 and Cabrestero, are crucial for maximizing long-term liquids recovery. Furthermore, Parex's demonstrated interest in strategic acquisitions, like its bid for GeoPark (NYSE: GPRK), signals a potential for further expansion and consolidation within the Colombian and Latin American energy landscape.

However, navigating the future will require strategic pivots and adaptations. Parex must continuously balance its growth investments with its commitment to shareholder returns, ensuring long-term value creation amidst market volatility. Operating primarily in Colombia, the company must adeptly manage the evolving geopolitical and regulatory landscape, particularly the government's energy transition agenda and potential shifts in resource nationalism policies. While currently focused on conventional oil and gas, Parex may need to consider long-term strategies related to the broader energy transition, potentially through investments in emissions reduction technologies or complementary energy ventures, to maintain relevance and attract investment in a decarbonizing world. Flexible capital allocation will also be paramount to respond to fluctuating commodity prices.

Market opportunities for Parex include Latin America's increasing importance in global energy security, driven by surging oil and gas production in the region and growing natural gas demand for power generation. The ongoing consolidation in the oil and gas industry also presents opportunities for Parex to expand its asset base or optimize its portfolio through strategic mergers and acquisitions. Conversely, significant challenges loom, primarily the persistent crude oil price volatility, with forecasts suggesting a potential decline in Brent crude prices to the mid-$50s per barrel by 2026 due to rising global inventories. Geopolitical instability in other regions and the long-term uncertainty of fossil fuel demand due to the global energy transition will also demand careful strategic planning.

Considering these factors, potential scenarios and outcomes vary. An optimistic scenario sees Parex successfully executing its programs, exceeding production guidance, and making accretive acquisitions, while oil prices stabilize at favorable levels. A base case involves moderate growth with some revenue pressure from declining oil prices, requiring continued capital discipline. A pessimistic scenario could involve a sharp and sustained decline in crude oil prices, coupled with operational challenges, forcing significant capital cuts and a focus on balance sheet preservation. Ultimately, Parex's ability to adapt its strategy, maintain capital discipline, and capitalize on value-accretive opportunities will be crucial for its long-term success in a dynamic energy market.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Navigating a Dynamic Energy Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 financial and operational performance, capped by an impressive surge in October 2025 production, presents a compelling narrative of resilience and strategic execution within a complex and often volatile energy commodity market. The company's ability to deliver robust results amidst broader market headwinds underscores its effective operational strategies and prudent financial management.

The key takeaways from Parex's recent performance are multi-faceted. The company reported a solid $105 million in funds flow from operations and $50 million in net income for Q3 2025. Operationally, average production increased by 3% quarter-on-quarter to 43,953 boe/d in Q3, with a significant jump to 49,300 boe/d in October. This growth was fueled by the substantial increase in output from the LLA-32 block following a tuck-in acquisition, and successful near-field exploration at LLA-74. The remarkable 93% year-on-year increase in natural gas production also highlights a strategic diversification. Financially, Parex maintains a strong balance sheet, continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and employs hedging strategies to mitigate price risk, demonstrating a balanced approach to growth and investor value.

Assessing the market moving forward, Parex is well-positioned for a strong start to 2026, with its Q4 2025 production expected to exceed the higher end of its annual guidance. Its ongoing exploration, particularly the high-impact Guapo-1 well at VIM-1, holds the potential for future reserve additions and production growth, which would further stabilize regional energy supply. While analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with some concerns regarding declining revenue and free cash flow growth, the company's strong technical indicators and positive earnings call sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, provided these operational gains prove sustainable. Parex's proactive risk management through crude oil hedges further instills confidence in its ability to navigate price volatility.

The significance and lasting impact of Parex's performance extend beyond its immediate financials. As a leading independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained operational execution and disciplined capital allocation set a benchmark for peers in the region. In an era of increasing energy transition pressures and resource nationalism, Parex's ability to grow production and maintain profitability while returning capital to shareholders provides a model for how conventional energy producers can thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted, efficient growth. This balanced approach is crucial for navigating unpredictable price swings and geopolitical uncertainties that define the modern energy landscape.

Investors should watch for several key indicators in the coming months. The preliminary results from the Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, expected by year-end 2025, will be a critical determinant of future growth potential. Further, monitoring the company's progress in bringing additional production-adding wells online across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo in Q4 2025 will be essential for gauging its momentum into 2026. Global crude oil price stability and the effectiveness of Parex's hedging strategies will directly influence profitability. Finally, continued analyst sentiment and any potential market rerating will depend on Parex's consistent delivery on operational promises and its ability to demonstrate sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth, addressing the concerns that currently temper its overall market perception.

From 2017 through 2021, the tariffs are estimated to have prevented 10.5 GW of solar capacity from being built.
The paper, Imported solar photovoltaics contributed to health and climate benefits in the United States, showed that 78% of solar panels deployed during this time were imports.
Modeling indicates that the Suniva tariffs worsened air quality and public health outcomes, resulting in roughly a hundred additional pollution-related deaths.
New and expanded U.S. solar trade barriers continue to raise costs and slow deployment, undercutting the very decarbonization targets those policies claim to defend.","Burning fossil fuels drives air pollution, intensifies heat, and accelerates climate change. These forces, in turn, fuel increasingly destructive hurricanes, some now so powerful that scientists have proposed adding a “Category 6” to the Saffir-Simpson scale to describe the extreme weather events that cause human suffering and death. Yet U.S. energy policy under the current administration has not merely favored fossil fuels; it has reverted to burning more fossil fuels to power the country, slowing the transition and worsening pollution’s toll.

Because the harm from pollution and climate change is slow, widespread, and diffuse, it’s easy for society to hide behind the mindset that “a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic.”

While it’s difficult to assign individual harm to broad policy decisions, there’s no doubt that air pollution has tangible, immediate effects. Three years after a Pittsburgh coal-processing plant closed in 2016, researchers documented a 42% drop in local emergency cardiovascular admissions. Reducing fossil emissions directly improves public health in measurable ways.

Suniva tariff public harm extrapolations

An analysis by the Solar Energy Industries Association lets us consider how the 2017 Suniva tariffs, imposed after the company filed a Section 201 trade petition, had a human cost in their obstructing of solar deployment. From 2017 through 2021, the tariffs are estimated to have prevented 10.5 GW of solar capacity from being built. That capacity would have generated roughly 18 TWh of electricity in 2022.

With natural gas providing 39% of U.S. electricity and coal 20% that year, we can—very roughly—estimate that 7 TWh would have been replaced by gas and 3.6 TWh by coal.

Gas-fired power is estimated to kill about 2.82 people per TWh through air-pollution-related effects, while coal kills 24 per TWh. Applying these rates, the Suniva tariffs are estimated to have led to 19 deaths from gas generation and 86 from coal—a total of about 105 avoidable American deaths in 2022 alone. The number of Americans left with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma likely reaches into the tens of thousands.

Solar module imports save lives

A more rigorous—and encouraging—analysis from researchers at the City University of New York found that solar panel imports into the United States displaced 305 TWh of fossil generation, avoided 178 million tons of CO2 emissions, and prevented 595 premature deaths between 2014 and 2022.

The paper, Imported solar photovoltaics contributed to health and climate benefits in the United States, showed that 78% of solar panels deployed during this time were imports. As utility-scale solar grew from “nearly zero” in 2010 to 3.4% of total U.S generation in 2022, those imported modules were critical.

Regional differences mattered. In Texas, one MWh of solar reduced gas generation by 0.70 MWh and coal by 0.31 MWh. In Florida, nearly all the displaced energy came from gas—0.97 MWh per MWh of solar.

Overall, imported solar panels generated $28 billion in combined health and climate benefits. Climate benefits made up 76% of that total, and air-pollution reductions the other 24%. On average, every kilowatt of imported solar produced $180 in health and climate benefits—about one-fifth of a system’s installation cost, separate from its energy value.

Strategy and consequences

While some would argue that it’s impossible to draw a straight line between a trade policy and an obituary, others—including this author—see a clear causal link. Modeling indicates that the Suniva tariffs worsened air quality and public health outcomes, resulting in roughly a hundred additional pollution-related deaths. Whether that figure is viewed as an estimate or an accusation, it reflects a policy failure with real human stakes.

Adding to the irony, the company that pushed hardest for those tariffs did not restart manufacturing until 2024, years after the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act reignited domestic production. Having already gone dark, Suniva leveraged the machinery of U.S. trade law to kneecap the industry.

The damage didn’t end there. New and expanded U.S. solar trade barriers continue to raise costs and slow deployment, undercutting the very decarbonization targets those policies claim to defend. Every delay in clean-energy buildout prolongs dependence on fuels that pollute and destabilize the climate. By contrast, imported solar modules over the past decade have accelerated emission reductions and delivered measurable—if diffuse—public-health and environmental gains.

If the United States intends to pursue energy dominance, it should do so through true abundance and evidence, not restriction and rhetoric. Tariffs slow the transition and prolong fossil dependence, while value-driven tax credits are already driving solar manufacturing and expanding domestic capacity across every link of the supply chain.

- Emissions trading, forest cover - China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.","China is the world's biggest emitter of planet-warning greenhouse gases but is also installing more renewable energy sources and putting more electric vehicles on its roads than any other country.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

- Emissions -

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

- Reduction targets -

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30 percent from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

- Fossil fuels, EVs -

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

- Emissions trading, forest cover -

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

The company’s focus is now on a potential seasonal year-end increase in luxury car sales and consumer incentives.

“For the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of new unit sales to improve, including less battery electric vehicles and a higher percentage of premium luxury, reflecting seasonal strength during the holiday season,” AutoNation CFO Tom Szlosek said during the earnings call.

Overall, AutoNation reported net income of $215.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 16% vs. the same period last year. On a same-store basis, revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion, while total same-store gross profit reached $1.2 billion, up 4%.

Too much BEV stock hit gross profit

EV sales jumped higher in Q3 for AutoNation and for the industry in general, as consumers rushed to beat the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit. AutoNation’s BEV sales were up 40% in Q3, accounting for 10% of its new-vehicle sales in the quarter, according to Manley.

However, with the need to clear dealer lots, profit margins on EVs “have been terrible for some time,” Manley said. That helped drag down AutoNation’s average gross profit per new vehicle of all drive types to $2,290 for the quarter, down 18.8% from a year ago. Year over year net income was also down 6% to $477 million.

Now, without the tax break and the pull-ahead effect of all those third-quarter EVs sales, demand is expected to fall in Q4. In anticipation, AutoNation ended the third quarter with just 1,550 BEVs in stock, less than a 20-day supply at its current sales rate. The company’s EV inventory is down 55% compared to the end of 2024, Manley said.

Aiming to self-source used cars

Based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., AutoNation had 243 new-car dealerships in the U.S. market as of Dec. 31, 2024, plus 24 AutoNation USA used-only stores.

Like other publicly traded, new-vehicle chains, AutoNation said it is trying to avoid rising acquisition costs for used-car inventory by self-sourcing as many used vehicles as possible instead of buying them at auctions.

“Overall, industry supply of used vehicles remains tight. We continue to be competitive in securing our vehicle supply from our retail operations, including trade-ins, ‘We Buy Your Car’ services, loaner conversions, and lease returns. We source more than 90% of our vehicles from these channels,” Szlosek said in the conference call.

The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.
Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods.
The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.
This approach aims to ensure consumer choice while providing access to the benefits of Australia’s abundant rooftop solar generation for households across different housing types and ownership arrangements.","Under the terms of the offering, energy retailers will be required to grant customers free solar-derived electricity for “at least three hours in the middle of the day”.

Bowen described the Solar Sharer offer as ensuring “every last ray of sunshine was powering our homes” while enabling more Australians to participate in the country’s solar energy transition.

The programme targets households with smart meters who can shift their electricity consumption to coincide with the designated free power periods during midday hours, when solar generation reaches its peak output.

The policy responds to Australia’s unique position as a global leader in distributed solar deployment, with the country hosting over four million rooftop installations, according to government figures. This extensive residential solar infrastructure has created significant midday generation surpluses that often exceed local demand, particularly during optimal weather conditions.

Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) has achieved record-breaking renewable energy performance in recent months, with rooftop solar capacity reaching 26.8GW in the first half of 2025. The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.

The Solar Sharer programme aims to address the economic challenges created by this generation abundance. Excess solar production during midday periods has reduced wholesale electricity prices and diminished feed-in tariff rates for rooftop solar owners, creating economic pressure on the distributed solar sector.

Indeed, the new programme seeks to increase daytime electricity consumption by incentivising households to operate appliances during peak solar generation windows.

Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods. The initiative covers all household electricity usage during the designated three-hour windows, including air conditioning, washing machines, dryers and other high-consumption appliances.

The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) will oversee the Solar Sharer programme to ensure customers receive fair pricing outside the free power periods. The regulatory framework aims to prevent retailers from inflating standard electricity rates to offset the cost of providing free daytime power, maintaining consumer protection across all usage periods.

The programme’s initial rollout covers Default Market Offer regions (New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland) where the Australian Energy Regulator sets benchmark electricity pricing.

The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.

The Solar Sharer initiative reflects broader trends in Australia’s electricity system transformation, where record-breaking surges in renewables and energy storage assets have fundamentally altered generation patterns and wholesale market dynamics. The programme represents a policy response to manage the integration challenges created by high renewable energy penetration.

Energy retailers will be required to offer Solar Sharer plans, but customers must actively opt into the program rather than being automatically enrolled.

MEXICO CITY, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Biobond, a global leader in sustainable material technology, officially launches its operations in Mexico today, introducing an advanced three-layer antimicrobial coating system designed to protect and enhance commercial, residential, industrial, and government facilities. The launch arrives at a pivotal time, coinciding with a historic national phase of infrastructure expansion under President Claudia Sheinbaum, including new industrial parks, hospitals, airports, and housing projects leading up to international events like the World Cup.

Innovation Meets Infrastructure Ambition

BioBond's certified solutions are specifically tailored for the $190B billion global adhesives and coatings market, aligning with international standards such as USDA Bio Preferred, Intertek Air Quality Gold, and LEED v5.

""BioBond's entry into Mexico couldn't be better timed,"" said Marc McConnaughey, CEO of BioBond. ""Mexico's ambitious infrastructure plans—from new railways and industrial parks to airport modernization—make this the perfect moment to bring our technology to a market that is shaping the future of construction. Our certified solutions help industries worldwide adopt safer and more sustainable practices.""

BioBond is entering the market in partnership with INSUMOS MAEZ, who will serve as the exclusive partner for commercialization and industry training across Mexico. Marco Díaz, Co-founder and CEO of Insumos Maez, emphasized the product's relevance: ""The pandemic reminded us of the critical importance of maintaining strict standards. We will take the lead in training and certifying the industry on the system's benefits and proper application. With major international events approaching, ensuring safe and sustainable environments is more relevant than ever.""

The BioBond System: Three Layers of Protection

The patented system utilizes three specialized biobased coatings that can be applied to a wide variety of materials, including concrete, ceramic, wood, and metal. This makes them ideal for spaces where hygiene and durability are critical, such as industrial kitchens, veterinary clinics, public restrooms, and high-traffic public areas.

BioCoat SWaE250 (Base Layer): Prepares surfaces and enhances adhesion, ensuring a solid foundation. Dries to the touch in just 2-3 hours.

BioCoat SSoE250 (Intermediate Layer): Seals the surface and helps eliminate odors, promoting a highly hygienic environment.

BioCoat SUP250 (Top Layer): Provides exceptional durability and resistance to wear, chemicals, and frequent cleaning, without generating harmful microplastics.

The coatings are proven to reduce odors, resist mold and bacteria growth with excellent durability. Beyond health and safety, this technology offers significant economic protection; a microbial outbreak can cost an industrial facility up to $5M million in shutdowns, a risk mitigated by the BioBond solution.

""We have been working directly with construction teams across Mexico to introduce the BioBond Powered By Nature system in multiple industries—from hospitality to industrial and commercial projects,"" said Dinorah Cambuston, Country Manager of BioBond. ""This hands-on approach has allowed us to deliver impactful results that solve client issues while adding measurable value to their projects.""

The arrival of BioBond's technology offers Mexican developers and contractors a new way to optimize hygiene, reduce operational risks, and contribute to LEED v5 and Net Zero sustainability.

$690M

How much Dominion expects U.S. tariffs to increase its offshore wind project costs.

~$50B

Five-year capital investment plan through 2029.

66%

How close to completion the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is.

17%

Increase in contracted data center capacity added this year.

Dominion Energy provides regulated electric service to about 3.6 million customers in Virginia and the Carolinas, and regulated natural gas service to about 500,000 customers in South Carolina. Its Contracted Energy segment operates the 2,098-MW Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut, various solar generation facilities and the Charybdis offshore wind installation vessel.

In the third quarter of 2025, Dominion’s regulated electric sales rose 3.3% year over year. Quarterly operating earnings grew to $921 million, up from $836 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Dominion’s 176-turbine, 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 66% complete, the utility company said Friday. The project, which will be the largest offshore wind farm by capacity in the U.S. once complete, is a 50-50 venture between Dominion and Stonepeak, an infrastructure investment firm that purchased its stake in the project in early 2024.

Dominion expects to finish onshore work and deliver the project’s first electrons to customers by the first quarter of 2026, executives said during an earnings conference call with analysts. Full completion remains on track for the end of 2026, though CEO Robert Blue said that installation of the final turbine towers could slip into early 2027 due to delays in commissioning Charybdis, Dominion’s turbine installation vessel.

Including an unused contingency of $206 million, total project costs stand at $11.2 billion, down about $15 million from last quarter, Blue said. According to its updated forecast, Dominion expects U.S. tariffs to increase the offshore wind project costs $690 million through 2026, with $218 million borne by Dominion and the remainder by Stonepeak.

Dominion now expects the levelized cost of electricity generated by the plant to come in at $84/MWh, up from $63/MWh in August due to expected lower revenue from renewable energy credits. That estimate is within the $80/MWh to $90/MWh range Dominion envisioned in its 2021 initial filing and would support a net monthly customer bill savings of 63 cents, it said.

On the call, Blue expressed confidence that “bipartisan support at all levels of government” would endure for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind after Virginia’s statewide elections this week.

“It’s the fastest way to get 2.6 GW on the grid that’s going to serve AI and technology companies, defense and security installations,” Blue said. “It’s critical to important infrastructure upgrades at the Oceana Naval Air Station. And if you stop it now, it causes energy inflation.”

Virginia data center boom continues

Dominion’s data center contracted capacity rose about 7 GW, or 17%, since December. Capacity with an electric service agreement rose from 8.8 GW to 9.8 GW while capacity with a construction letter of authorization jumped from 5.2 GW to 9 GW during the period.

Both project categories involve guaranteed payments to Dominion, even when a customer walks away from construction or fails to meet expected load levels.

Across its entire service territory, Blue said Dominion has received 17 GW of delivery point requests from data centers so far this year and more than 58 GW since 2020. It has “communicated firm rates” for more than 25 GW of capacity expected to energize through 2031, he added. The typical data center project takes four to seven years from delivery point request to meter hookup, he said.

“Our data center load just continues to grow, and the demand continues to grow, which is something considering that we have connected 450 data centers already and we’ve got more than 25% of our sales going to data centers in Virginia,” Blue said.

Dialing in an ‘all of the above’ resource strategy

Dominion executives on Friday detailed the utility’s “all of the above” resource strategy. The utility’s roughly $50 billion five-year capital investment plan includes a mix of transmission, thermal and renewable power projects, they said.

Notable regulatory and process milestones in the third quarter include submitting transmission project proposals to the PJM Interconnection in August; filing post-hearing briefs for the 1-GW Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a Virginia gas-fired peaker plant with four 250-MW turbines; submitting an application for 845 MW of solar and 145 MW of energy storage projects across its territory, part of what Blue said would be a planned “cadence roughly of a [gigawatt] of solar a year”; and filing its latest Virginia integrated resource plan.

Dominion said PJM’s transmission selections could come in early 2026. If approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, likely by the end of this year, the Chesterfield plant could begin construction next year and come online in 2029. Blue said Dominion’s size and long supplier relationships positioned it well to secure turbines and other long-lead equipment for gas and data center projects.

Measured caution on new nuclear

Dominion’s Virginia proposed IRP pushed back the date of a possible small modular reactor in the state by five years.

Blue cautioned against “[reading] too much into that” and reiterated his company’s memorandum of understanding with Amazon to explore an SMR at its North Anna nuclear power plant in southeastern Virginia. He described Virginia as “the most nuclear-friendly state in the country” thanks to strong policy support, existing civilian reactors and its naval nuclear supply chain.

But fiscal prudence dictates a measured approach to new nuclear investments, Blue added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9Gz9V2FMNHt3xFPzBbSjNgb6b03EiS-0ZYNwFPae3Iw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DVk9XXzAzNDMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 13:07:06.293872

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators.
Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.
COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.
Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.","However, we should first acknowledge that 10 years onward with the Paris Agreement in place, the world has made real progress—from the 36.2 million jobs generated by clean energy globally (more than oil, gas, coal, and fossil-engine manufacturing combined) to the exponential growth of solar energy (now four times what was predicted in 2015). Yet the latest reports show we are still drifting off course from limiting global temperature increase to 1.5–2 degrees Celsius, with profound consequences for people and the planet.

To change course, we need both emergency brakes and acceleration—brakes on the forces driving deforestation and forest degradation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise and acceleration in actions, such as deploying clean energy, efficient cooling, early warning systems, accessible finance, and affordable insurance, while protecting lives and livelihoods. Scaling up investment in these solutions is essential for a safer, more resilient future.

This is why COP30 matters. It must move beyond headlines and targets to focus on turning commitments into action—strengthening the cycle of planning, implementation, and accountability created in Paris to raise ambition over time. As an “implementation COP,” the international community must recalibrate this multilateral process and center those who are most affected by strengthening our ability to decarbonize supply chains, adapt to the changing climate, and address rising losses and damages, along with ensuring that vulnerable countries and communities are no longer left behind.

The Brazilian COP30 presidency has signaled that this will be a COP that’s centered on climate adaptation and resilience—and rightly so. Rethinking resilience means building systems that can anticipate, absorb, and recover from shocks, in addition to sustaining progress toward a livable future. This focus could not be timelier. Amid geopolitical headwinds and more extreme climate events, COP30 must serve as a cornerstone for strengthening resilience—across economies, communities, and ecosystems alike—by:

Enhancing the ability of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to remain beacons of light in the midst of external shocks

Let us be clear here: While global cooperation may be strained, the Paris Agreement has nevertheless held firm—preventing the world from veering toward even greater 4–5°C warming trajectories. No country has followed the United States in leaving the accord. Global investment in renewables now doubles that of fossil fuels. Climate measures have increased sevenfold, with more than 80 percent of the global economy committed to net zero targets. Still, the pace and scale of action, along with the means of implementation—finance, capacity building, and technology transfer—remain far from sufficient. New tools and ideas are emerging to close this gap, from the International Court of Justice advisory opinion to innovative investment mechanisms, bolstered by the momentum from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Congress in Abu Dhabi.

Rallying the world to close the emissions and resilience gaps

COP30 must signal a truly collective response to both the emissions gap and the resilience gap—helping nations adapt to intensifying climate impacts while limiting losses to lives and livelihoods. This will require formal decisions and strong action from governments that accelerate implementation on the ground. Central to this effort is doubling down on untapped opportunities, including reducing emissions other than carbon dioxide, like methane or HFCs from refrigerants, and ensuring “just transitions”—moving away from fossil fuels in a way that protects workers, communities, and economies, in addition to reducing poverty and leaving no one behind.

Adapting, addressing loss and damage, and putting justice at the center

Adaptation efforts have long been underfunded and insufficient, leaving communities exposed to mounting climate impacts. COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators. Yet even the best adaptation has limits, and unavoidable losses and damages are increasing, as seen in the recent devastation from Hurricane Melissa and other record-breaking events worldwide. Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.

Ensuring that nature is part of the solution

Protecting and restoring forests, mangroves, and wetlands and reforming agriculture and food systems not only reduce emissions but also strengthen our resilience to climate impacts. They need to be integral to climate decision-making. In order to be on track to halt and reverse deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, the degradation in the Global North, which holds some of the most carbon-rich forests in the world, should receive the same level of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability as the tropics. This issue was elevated at the 2025 IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, through the adoption of an NRDC-led motion. The COP30 presidency’s anticipated launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility is a potentially positive step toward delivering further progress, but it requires more robust engagement of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and standards that capture all drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.

Mobilizing financial flows to those who need it

Finance remains the elephant in the room. COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most. At COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, the international community committed to mobilizing at least $1.3 trillion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, with developed nations taking the lead in mobilizing at least $300 billion annually. COP30 is about engineering a major leap in both funding and delivery. Adaptation and resilience must receive a fair share while private and public flows are mobilized with transparency, accountability, and impact.

This is why NRDC will be with our partners in Belém this year (as well as in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo beforehand for other preconference dialogues and forums). Together, we aim to shape a COP30 package that drives forward a durable transition to a clean, low-carbon global economy and resilient future for the planet and its people. Our focus will be on four key thematic areas:

Catalyzing a finance step change, especially for adaptation and ensuring that the private and public sectors both work in concert to channel funds to the right kinds of efforts on the ground.

Holding governments accountable for the ambition and delivery of their 2035 climate plans, at a time when every fraction of a degree matters.

Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.

Advancing equitable accountability for forest protection to preserve forests as critical carbon stores and sinks and tackle drivers of forest degradation and deforestation across both the Global North and Global South.

All of these efforts, in synergy with other multilateral processes—like the High Seas Treaty, the Montreal Protocol, the biodiversity and desertification conventions—are central to not only upholding multilateralism and global cooperation as a cornerstone of equitable global climate governance but also to meeting the human imperative of building a safer, healthier, and more prosperous society.

COP30 is a moment to mobilize all hands—Rio de Janeiro’s local leaders, São Paulo’s private sector, youth, women, faith-based communities, Indigenous and local communities, academics and engineers—to be, and continue to be, the changemakers turning the promise of the Paris Agreement into reality. It is also about ensuring the agreement remains a guiding beacon, providing the frameworks, space, and inspiration needed to catalyze transformative action for people and the planet.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/cop30-belem-brazil-RC294GA7KHOS.JPG?h=2e111cc1&itok=hvwr3_gN,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:38.993038

The aim would be to foster more international investment and not rely on government subsidies to boost the wind power sector in the United Kingdom. To ensure wind power projects are built and commissioned, the UK government holds annual auctions to incentivize renewable energy operators to invest in the nation’s wind power sector.

The UK guarantees a set purchasing price for wind power, which, without the government subsidies, operators may favor other markets. However, the latest round of auction documents details the UK’s plan to offer less cash to operators. The “contracts for difference” in the UK are essential to make wind power projects appear viable and financially stable for potential investors.

The UK’s next auction round will see significantly less “contracts for difference” funding

Documents released by the UK government note that this year’s auction round will see substantially less money being provided by the state. This year’s auction round budget will sit at around $1.2 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year. It should be noted that this year’s auction round will allocate $236 million for earlier-stage floating wind technology, which was nonexistent in last year’s budget.

“Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price.” – British Minister for Energy Michael Shank

Industry experts have warned of the impact of the new round of auction’s budget

The UK has plans to decarbonize by the end of the decade and has selected wind power as the best and most practical driver to achieve this. However, market analysts have noted that if this year’s prices are anything like last year’s, the UK is in danger of not meeting its 2030 decarbonization target.

Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research, has stated that the proposed funding of the UK’s wind power sector places the nation in danger of missing the mark for decarbonization. Mr Menon noted that the expected capacity is set to be around 4.9 GW if last year’s prices are repeated in 2025.

“This would set the government’s ambitious offshore wind capacity target to achieve CP2030 (clean power 2030) out of sight, as it requires at least seven to nine GW to be procured, which would require extremely competitive bids that are unlikely to materialise.” – Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research

Europe’s offshore wind sector has been grappling with its growing dependence on the Chinese supply train, which raises concerns over national security among a litany of other worries.

Reports show that the state saw an estimated 263 power outages from 2019 to 2023 alone. Now, when the power grid of America’s beloved Lone Star State is already stretched thin due to fast renewable integration and slow transmission upgrades, it is truly being pushed to the limit by a rush of AI and data center developments. While utilities forecast that new power won’t be available for years, developers are not deterred.

In San Antonio, grid operators informed data center operators they would not receive another megawatt of power until 2032. For most companies, that would be a signal to stand down. But data center developers are moving ahead with construction plans, resorting to behind-the-meter power sources like natural gas turbines and fuel cells to stay on course.

Experts at Texas-based IIR Energy, an energy market intelligence firm powered by Industrial Info Resources, indicate the trend as a milestone for Texas energy and technology industries. The firm’s research teams are observing how growth in data centers is transforming power usage, grid stability, and the economic landscape of the state.

The Texas Boom That Outpaced the Grid

Texas has become one of the hottest data center markets in the nation. IIR Energy estimates around $2.7 trillion in data center projects underway globally, with roughly $1 trillion in new capital spending invested in the United States in the last nine months. Much of this momentum is in Texas. Builders continue flocking to the state due to its mix of renewable energy, business-friendly tax incentives, and low-cost real estate.

Shane Mullins, IIR Energy’s Director of Global Power, explained how, in San Antonio, developers have already been informed that it will be 2032 before they can utilize another megawatt of power for growth. “It’s not holding up developers,” he said. “They’re just finding a way to do it another way.”

That resolve illustrates a larger truth: the digital economy is expanding faster than the infrastructure that supports it.

Behind the Meter: How Developers Are Adapting

To avoid delays on the grid, Texas developers are capitalizing on on-site generation systems to keep plans on track. The behind-the-meter strategy enables facilities to generate power independently, typically from natural gas-fired engines, small gas turbines, or fuel cells.

By building on-site power facilities, operators are becoming resilient and adaptable.

Mullins called this transition a revolution in how industry considers power. “Every data center is now a power project,” Mullins stated. “And every data center that’s not a power project is influencing the power industry.”

These developments bring technology and energy production closer together, with each new plant bringing stress as well as opportunity to the larger system.

A Reliability Crisis in the Making

Despite innovation, experts warn that Texas’s energy infrastructure is lagging behind. While renewable generation has grown rapidly, it cannot fully support AI’s constant power requirements.

Vice President of Power Industry Research at IIR Energy, Britt Burt, stated the imbalance is worse. “We’ve added a lot of wind, solar, and battery storage, but not much baseload generation—and that’s what we depend on every day to meet demand. The system hasn’t caught up,” he added.

While demand for electricity rises by up to two percent annually, reliability issues are accumulating nationwide. Texas, previously touted as energy independent, has become a benchmark for the consequences of digitalization outpacing infrastructure upgrades.

Coal-fired plants have postponed retirement to maintain pace with increasing load requirements, and wholesale prices have risen up to 800 percent in regional capacity auctions.

Reliable Data Matters

In this high-speed market that’s changing by the day, accurate information is critical. IIR Energy’s proprietary research approach enables its analysts to track projects from announcement to in-service, providing insight into developments that are actually happening and those that will fall short on grid constraints.

Executive Vice President of Marketing and Analytics at IIR Energy, Mike Bergen, noted that the value of the company lies in that level of verification. “We track projects through to completion,” he said. “So, at any given point in time, we can actually say how much of this $2 trillion market is actually approved and moving forward.”

This transparency gives confidence to energy traders, utilities, banks, and investors when making choices about where to invest and how to prepare for increasing demand.

In the end, the grid challenge in Texas is a national one: how to reconcile AI-driven innovation with sustainable, scalable energy supply. As Texas, the U.S., and beyond keep a close eye on the industry and data center progression, IIR Energy surfaces as more than a provider of numbers. They help determine where the next wave of opportunities and risks will land. Seeing those dynamics now will inform how Texas fuels the AI decade to come.",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Matthew.png,N,,2025-11-04 12:12:15.524132

RESEARCHERS CREATE REVOLUTIONARY AI FABRIC THAT PREDICTS ROAD DAMAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS

The road that powers your vehicle

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus — all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it's only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

,American Energy,2025-11-04 15:34:14+00:00,Utility Dive,What the last gas boom (and bust) says about today's rush to build | Utility Dive,"Diana DiGangi, Meris Lutz",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/gas-power-plant-boom-bust-data-center-ai-trump/801991/,"At the same time, major gas pipeline expansions are planned or proposed.
According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW.
Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors.
Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.
“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Twenty-five years ago, a data center boom helped fuel a race to build gas-fired power plants, with the energy secretary, utilities, politicians and experts warning of blackouts and economic stagnation if the country didn’t meet surging demand for electricity.

By 2001, however, the dot com bubble had burst, the economy was in recession and the huge demand increase never materialized. Efficiency and productivity improved rapidly, and demand remained more or less level for the next two decades, leaving many utilities with excess capacity and ratepayers footing the bill.

Some analysts and industry sources see parallels between then and now. Once again, headlines are warning of imminent energy shortfalls due largely to the power needs of artificial intelligence. Leading figures in government and industry are promoting more firm generation, and particularly gas, as a matter of economic and national security.

“Can the same thing happen? Definitely,” said Eugene Kim, Wood Mackenzie’s Americas Gas Research team director. “The utilities and anyone planning for power demand is forecasting unprecedented and, in some cases, even exponential growth. Whether that materializes or not – huge degree of uncertainty.”

Gas investment reaches new heights

Investment firms, utilities, tech giants, energy companies and others are pouring billions into acquiring existing gas plants or developing new ones to serve data centers. Gas power merger and acquisition valuations have doubled since 2024, reaching up to $1.93 million/MW in some markets, according to energy analytics firm Enverus.

While there are echoes of the millennium today, there are a few important differences.

The first is that the U.S. is producing and consuming more gas than ever before — driven largely by the rise of fracking — with production concentrated in Texas and Louisiana to the south, and Pennsylvania and West Virginia farther north.

Secondly, as the U.S. became a gas-producing powerhouse, the gas and electric power sectors have become much more interdependent. In 2000, the electric power sector accounted for about 22% percent of U.S. gas consumption, while gas accounted foraround 16% of electricity produced, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

By 2023, the electric power sector accounted for about 40% of total U.S. natural gas consumption, and gas accounted for about 42% to 43% of utility-scale electricity generation, making it the single largest fuel source, the EIA says. Over the years, the role of gas has grown, largely displacing coal as the latter became uneconomical.

The third key difference is the rise of renewables and storage on a large scale. While gas is the dominant source of fuel for U.S. power generation, it makes up a small fraction of new generation coming online this year, and energy storage is taking a small but growing share of daily peak demand when the sun goes down. Utility-scale wind and solar account for 83% of FERC’s “high probability” additions through July 2028, while gas makes up about 16%.

There is some evidence that could change.

The outlook for renewables has dimmed since President Donald Trump came to office this year and largely made good on his promises to repeal tax credits, permits and other government support for wind and solar while throwing his weight behind fossil fuels.

Scott Wilmot, an energy analyst at Enverus, said before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, he would have said the quality and size of the renewable project pipeline was more than enough to meet projected energy demands. Now, he’s not so sure.

“The reality is the [levelized cost of electricity] for these renewable projects has gone up without those tax credits,” he said. “A lot of folks who are developing these projects are probably reconsidering a lot of their pipeline.”

The PJM interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, is fast tracking 11.8 GW of generation, mostly from gas. Gas also dominated MISO’s fast track interconnection review, accounting for 19 GW out of 26 GW. In ERCOT, gas went from 6.8% of the interconnection queue in August 2024 to 9.1% as of August 2025.

At the same time, major gas pipeline expansions are planned or proposed.

Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate National Gas Association of America, said existing pipelines are currently running at capacity, and her organization’s members are reporting a “record number” of inquiries for new pipelines from potential customers.

“They indicate they have not seen this level of interest in building since around 2010 when the fracking boom drove interest in pipeline development,” Andryszak said in an emailed statement. “Many members are already announcing new or revived pipeline projects, and we expect many more will file for certificates at [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] over the next 18 months.”

FERC is expected to issue guidance soon on colocation rules, which could potentially make it easier to route gas directly to data centers and other large loads.

What would be the largest gas-fired power plant in the country is a 4.5 GW project being developed by Knighthead Capital Management at the former Homer City coal plant in Pennsylvania as part of a 3,200-acre data center campus.

Some developers say even without data centers, electricity demand is rising and gas, which is firm, dispatchable and proven, will be an important part of the energy mix for decades to come, especially as more coal generation retires.

Bilal Khan is an executive at Blackstone who oversaw the firm’s recent acquisition of the 620-MW natural gas power plant Hill Top Energy Center in Pennsylvania for about $1,600/kW. The state is part of PJM, which is already setting record capacity auction prices, making it an attractive market for producers. The grid operator has said that is due to supply and demand conditions, but its independent market monitor says data centers are the “primary reason” for the price surge.

Khan said that even putting aside data centers, he’s bullish on natural gas thanks to the other factors driving increased power demand, including manufacturing and electrification.

“We still need new power supply that’s reliable, consistent and affordable,” Khan said. “This moment is unique and in contrast to the last approximately 20 years when power demand was flat.”

A risky investment

Khan acknowledged, however, that new natural gas plants face significant obstacles. The backlog for new turbines, for example, can stretch up to seven years amid global competition for those and other components like transformers.

“There’s an equipment shortage, there’s a labor shortage and it’s more challenging to obtain all necessary permits,” Khan said.

And the cost of deploying new gas generation is rising fast.

According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW. An analysis by GridLab adds another $1,500/kW levelized for the 20-year cost of fuel and $500/kW for pipeline infrastructure, putting the cost of new gas generation at $4,000/kW to $4,500/kW.

Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon Energy, spent years working on natural gas projects alongside nuclear and renewables before transitioning to focus on renewables exclusively. He suggested there was a ceiling to how much gas could be built to meet near-term demand given the prices, pipeline constraints and interconnection queues.

“Tens of gigawatts of new generation from natural gas is likely at least five years away, if not more,” Smith said.

Changing market dynamics also mean new gas-powered generators face tighter conditions under which they would be economical to run, according to a recent report on thermal generation from Ascend Analytics.

Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors. But overall, Ascend said, the value of gas assets will become increasingly concentrated in “narrow, infrequent windows of time,” increasing the importance of availability, secure fuel supply and strategically-scheduled preventative maintenance.

“In the face of rising electricity demand and declining capacity accreditation for renewables and storage, the need for dispatchable, long-duration capacity resources will persist. To meet this need, new gas capacity will be built,” it concluded. “However, investments in new gas should be made cautiously, prudently, and strategically. Thermal generation will remain a risky investment, with stranded asset risks not going away.”

Have utilities learned their lesson?

Against a backdrop of rising residential power bills, utilities and regulators say they are taking precautions to protect ratepayers from the possibility of a bubble.

NRG Energy’s vice president of regulatory affairs, Travis Kavulla, said past experience has formed the industry’s current approach in which competitive generators carry the risk of load forecasts – at least in deregulated markets.

“All of that has ramifications for the extent to which people are comfortable rapidly building out generation,” he said during a recent panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation. “That’s why it’s so important for long-term offtake agreements to be formalized in this industry.”

Some regulators and utilities are moving to place more of the risk on hyperscalers by creating new rate classes for large loads. At least 30 states have proposed or approved large-load tariffs over the past several years to manage growth and protect existing ratepayers, according to a database from the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center and the Smart Electric Power Alliance.

“Whether those power plants or the gas pipeline go underutilized because that boom didn’t realize is yet to be determined.”

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission recently approved AEP Ohio’s plan to make data centers pay for at least 85% of the energy they request, even if they use less, to cover the cost of infrastructure. It also requires data centers to show they are financially viable and to pay an exit fee if their project is canceled or they can’t meet obligations.

Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.

“We just can’t have absolutely unmitigated data center demand growth,” he said. “Otherwise, things are going to be very challenging for the ratepayer.”

Dominion Energy, which serves the area around Ashburn, Virginia – home to the highest concentration of data centers in the world — has proposed a similar tariff. Under its proposal, large load customers would be required to make a 14-year commitment to pay for the power they request regardless of how much they actually use.

Aaron Ruby, spokesperson for Dominion, said the utility is focused on making sure residential customers aren’t subsidizing the cost of infrastructure needed by data center customers and has yet to encounter delays as it pursues 5.9 GW of new gas generation.

He suggested, however, that there was little danger of overbuilding. In the last 20 years, he could only recall one example of Dominion developing infrastructure for a data center that fell through.

“Within a year or two, another data center customer emerged and fully utilized the infrastructure,” he said.

Others expressed skepticism.

Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar with Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, said it was still very early to know what effects AI will have on power consumption.

“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said. “We are making an investment to build out that grid infrastructure based on these very frothy assumptions.”

Kim, the Wood Mackenzie gas researcher, suggested that the power industry has matured since the last bubble burst.

Back then, the three dominant gas turbine manfacturers — GE Vernova, Mitsubishi and Seimens — were “burned significantly,” he said. “The utilities were burned significantly by overbuilding, and now they’re more cautious.”

Kim predicted gas generation will likely continue to increase due to coal retirements and growing demand for electricity, with or without data centers. Advanced manufacturing facilities require more energy. Summers are getting hotter as the climate changes, increasing demand for cooling, and larger renewable portfolios will require dispatchable generation that cannot currently be replaced by storage, he added.

But an economic slump, technological innovation, improved efficiency and any number of unforeseen factors could impact what is still a highly speculative growth scenario, he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/B4vwrgP2vkfth1H5ATt36B1w0vSN4Fyof8jpHl4RtiI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ib282STVBMjU1Ny5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-04 11:02:37.617255

So this month, they’re hoping for fewer promises and more action.

Past pledges from nearly 200 nations have fallen far short and new plans submitted this year barely speed up pollution-fighting efforts, experts say. And if the numbers aren’t sobering enough for world leaders when they kick off the action Thursday, there’s the setting: Belem, a relatively poor city on the edge of a weakened Amazon.

Unlike past climate negotiations — and especially the one 10 years ago that forged the landmark Paris climate agreement — this annual U.N. conference isn’t primarily aimed at producing a grand deal or statement over its two weeks. Organizers and analysts frame this Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 — as the “implementation COP.”

“This is really going to be much more about what are we doing on the ground,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at limiting warming.

Figueres and many of more than three dozen experts interviewed by The Associated Press said negotiators have already pinned down the goal. What’s needed now is more money and political will for countries to put decades of words and promises into action and policy to reduce heat-trapping gases and stop deforestation. Only that will put the brakes on global warming as it careens toward a level the world has agreed is too dangerous, they say.

Adapting to a warmer world and saving forests

In Belem, diplomats, activists, scientists and business leaders will discuss new national climate-fighting plans, the need to save trees that absorb carbon pollution, how communities can adapt to warming and how to financially help developing nations hit hardest by climate change.

Host Brazil will preside and set the agenda. For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

Those leaders arrive Thursday for a two-day pre-meeting summit to discuss ratcheting up the fight against climate change.

“Holding COP in the Amazon itself creates a new level of accountability. You can’t talk about climate solutions while standing on the land that’s absorbing the planet’s carbon and ignore the people who protect it,” said Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada, and executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.

Top polluters won’t be at pre-summit

That high-level meeting is likely to be missing top leaders of the biggest carbon-polluting nations: China, the U.S. and India. They contribute about 52% of the world’s heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

China is sending its deputy premier. The U.S. is mostly skipping this conference under President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who’s begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement. Some U.S. cities and states are coming to show that they and businesses take climate change seriously, said former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who co-chairs a group called America Is All In.

Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. said it’s important world leaders understand the threat to countries like his: “Without the United States, without China, without India committing, we really have no hope.”

“We want to see action … particularly from the largest polluters,” Whipps said. “Our communities live on the front lines and we cannot afford more promises.”

Figueres said she hopes “because of the craziness in the United States that there is an expanded sense of, this is the moment to pull together.”

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told the AP he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Promising to cut more pollution or focusing on fulfilling pledges?

There’s already a divide on the nature of this meeting. Brazil is stressing implementation of past plans as well as what’s in new emissions-cutting plans submitted this year. But smaller island nations, such as Palau, and scientists are saying that’s not enough. It dooms Earth to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, they said.

Palau and other island nations want negotiators to tell countries to be more ambitious in their new carbon pollution-cutting plans.

Implementing “mediocrity,” said Natural Resources Defense Council adaptation chief Adelle Thomas, “is not creating a future for vulnerable nations.”

But if nations do what they’ve already promised in past climate-fighting plans, it could trim an entire degree Celsius — 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit — from projected warming, said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of World Resources Institute. Scientists agreed with the estimate. Dasgupta said negotiators have too long focused on big commitments instead of outcomes in the real economy, which he said is “the messier thing” that doesn’t get headlines.

“What we now need to do is deliver against what we have signed on to,” said scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany.

Path to disaster or optimism?

“The challenge today is not whether we will phase out fossil fuels. The challenge today is will we be too late?” Rockstrom said. “We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.”

Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad. But she co-founded an a organization called Global Optimism and said she’s sure the world can do this.

“My optimism is not naive. I know what we’re up against,” she said. “But my optimism is about determination. It’s about we’re up against a really, really, really challenging threat here. And we don’t give up.”

Before you can put a new horse to work, you've got to train it.

Jackson Watford was learning to do just that on a mild, sunny morning last September at Elk River Livestock, a regenerative ranch about 30 minutes north of Steamboat Springs.

The 21-year-old led a pony named Seven out of the stables, towards the training corral, or round pen.

“He is the youngest one on the ranch,” Watford said of the young horse. “He hasn't been messed with much this summer. So, this will be his first time in the round pen.”

With time and training, Seven would be able to join the team of working horses used to manage the ranch's cattle and pastures.

Watford was in training, too. As a first-year apprentice on the ranch, this experience earned him credit towards an associate's degree in agriculture business management from North Carolina State University.

At the same time, Watford learned the ins and outs of regenerative ranching—a method of raising livestock that involves grazing cattle at high densities for very short periods of time on small sections of pasture. The technique is much more labor intensive than conventional ranching, which keeps cattle spread out on much larger pastures for extended periods. Proponents say the regenerative style is more aligned with the natural ecosystem of the grasslands and promotes soil health.

The work kept Watford busy all summer, moving electric fencing and cattle from pasture to pasture.

“We would move them every day or two, to get them onto new grass and allow this grass to rest,” Watford explained. “It's definitely more work, but I really enjoy it and I think it's worth it in the end of the day.”

Watford’s mentor, rancher Davey Baron, owns and operates Elk River Livestock. He’s been ranching in Northwest Colorado for about a decade and sees this regenerative approach as critical for keeping the ranch afloat in a hotter, drier climate.

“Hearing old timers talk, we used to get monsoons every day. Used to be so wet,” Baron said. “Now we're dry.”

In fact, after seeing the region change over the years, Baron believes that adapting to the warming climate is now an essential skill for ranchers.

“If you're not managing differently for dry times, then you're not doing it correctly,” he said.

As climate change intensifies, adaptation skills are increasingly part of career training for the next generation of farmers and ranchers.

Hands-on climate adaptation

Training new agricultural producers in the art of climate adaptation is the big idea behind that apprenticeship program, which is run by the Quivia Coalition, an agriculture and environment nonprofit operating throughout the Mountain West.

“It offers an opportunity, particularly for people who don't come from ranching and farming backgrounds to get a foot in the door in these careers,” said Leah Ricci, the Quivira Coalition’s agrarian program director.

Since the apprenticeship program was launched in 2009, more than 150 apprentices have graduated. About 80% of them go on to have careers in agriculture. The regenerative techniques they learn as apprentices shape their approach to the work.

“As we're entering increasingly long periods of drought and climate instability, young people going into these careers know that it's not really a choice anymore,” Ricci said. “They have to be using climate smart practices in order to have a financially sustainable business.”

Mentors are veteran farmers and ranchers with deep experience in regenerative techniques who feel called to pass their specialized knowledge forward to the next generation of agricultural producers. Many see the mentoring as a necessity – a way for them to cultivate the kind of workforce they want to tap.

“Some of them have talked with us about the challenge of finding labor who care about the same things and are excited about moving fence as often as they have to do to get the grazing outcomes that they want,” Ricci said.

Climate adaptation enters the classroom

These days, hands-on experiences like the Quivira Coalition’s apprenticeship complement what goes on in the classroom as climate adaptation becomes a bigger, more sophisticated part of the national agriculture curriculum.

“Agriculture producers have to address climate change,” said Travis Park, director for agricultural education with the National Council for Agricultural Education. “It's causing additional stresses on livestock. There are new diseases and pest pressures. So, they have to change their management practices (based) on the science end of agriculture.”

Education in climate adaptation doesn’t stop at regenerative practices. Agriculture students today learn things like how to use advanced technology—drones and artificial intelligence—to be smarter about their work. It’s a practice called enhanced precision agriculture. Farmers make use of granular data about soil type, historical yield rates and crop growth to apply only the right amount of pesticides and fertilizers with hyper precision, at the exact time and placement best suited for each crop. The approach helps farmers cut down on costly inputs and respond in real time to changing climate conditions.

“We want our students to understand the science of agriculture,” Park said. “And to understand the science of agriculture, we need to understand the science of climate change and make production decisions based on the science in both those areas.”

That science is now being taught to more than a million students enrolled in agriculture education programs at high schools and colleges across the country.

But for ranching apprentice Jackson Watford, it’s the hands-on experience learning regenerative techniques at Elk River Livestock that captured his imagination.

“I really learned a lot more being out here than I did two years in college,” Watford said. “Experiencing everything day to day, making mistakes, messing stuff up—I learn a lot better doing that than just sitting in a classroom.”

Miles from any classroom, in the training corral with the unschooled pony at Elk River, Watford was trying to get the animal used to following directions. His mentor, Davey Baron, stood by and coached, offering tips on the subtler details of horsemanship.

“You're not trying to force him into submission,” Baron counseled his apprentice. “You're trying to make him a tough, resilient thinker.”

It's what Baron is trying to do for the next generation of ranchers, too. After all, he said they'll need to be smart and nimble to stay ahead of a volatile climate.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ee55f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4192x2201+0+472/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F20%2F5b2c7e7c4e0aaa033fe54440f48b%2Fimg-2713-edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 11:03:42.892199

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land.
Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.
“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said.
“And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov.","Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped to the microphone at the state Democratic headquarters in mid-August with the conviction of a man certain he was on the right side of history, bluntly saying California has a moral obligation to thwart President Trump’s attempt to tilt the balance of Congress.

Over the next 2½ months, Newsom became the public face of Proposition 50, a measure designed to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives by temporarily redrawing California’s congressional districts.

Newsom took that leap despite tepid support for a gerrymandering measure in early polls.

With Tuesday’s election, the fate of Proposition 50 arrives at a pivotal moment for Newsom, who last week acknowledged publicly that he’s weighing a 2028 presidential run. The outcome will test not only his political instincts but also his ability to deliver on a measure that has national attention fixed squarely on him.

From the outset, Newsom paired his conviction with caution.

“I’m mindful of the hard work ahead,” Newsom said in August, shortly after lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot.

It was familiar territory for a governor who has built a career on high-stakes political bets. As San Francisco mayor, his decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004 made him a progressive icon. It also drew accusations he’d energized conservative turnout that year in the presidential election that ended with George W. Bush winning a second term.

As the state’s newly elected governor, he suspended the death penalty in 2019 despite voters having twice rejected measures to do so, calling it a costly and biased system that “fails to deliver justice” — a move that drew fury from law enforcement groups and victims’ families. His decision to take on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a 2023 prime-time debate hosted by Sean Hannity on Fox News was intended to showcase his command of policy and political agility, but instead fell flat amid an onslaught of insults.

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land. Ahead of Tuesday’s special election, polling suggests he may have played his cards right. Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.

“You know, not everybody would have done it,” veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman said. “He saw the risk and he took it.”

If approved by voters, the ballot measure would redraw California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats beginning with the 2026 midterm elections in hopes of discounting Republican efforts to gerrymander more seats for themselves. California introduced the measure in response to Trump and his political team leaning on Republican-led states to redraw their district lines to help Republicans retain control of the House.

The balance of power in the closely divided House will determine whether Trump can advance his agenda during his final two years in office — or face an emboldened Democratic majority that could move to challenge, or even investigate, his administration.

And while critics of the governor see a power-craving politician chasing headlines and influence, supporters say this is classic Newsom: confident, risk-tolerant and willing to stand alone when he believes he’s right. He faced intense backlash from his political allies when he had conservative personality Charlie Kirk as his inaugural guest on his podcast this year, on which Newsom said he believed it was “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. After Kirk was killed, Newsom regularly brought up that interview as a point of pride, noting the backlash he received from his own party over hosting a Trump ally.

In recent months Newsom struck a deal to stabilize struggling oil refineries, pushed cities to ban homeless encampments and proposed walking back healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants — a series of moves that have tested his standing with progressives. Supporters say the moves show his pragmatic streak, while critics argue they reflect a shift to the center ahead of a possible presidential run.

“In so many ways, he is not a cautious politician,” said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School. “His brand is big, bold decisions.”

With Proposition 50, Newsom has cast the redistricting counterpunch as a moral imperative, arguing that Democrat-led states must “fight fire with fire,” even if it means pausing a state independent redistricting process largely considered the gold standard. The measure upends a system Californians overwhelmingly endorsed to keep politics out of the map-drawing process.

Levinson said Newsom’s profile has been rising along with the polling numbers for Proposition 50 as he has booked national television shows like ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and appeared in an ad in favor of the ballot measure with former President Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other prominent Democrats that ran during the World Series.

“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said. “And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov. Newsom of California spearheading the effort to pass.’”

California Republicans have called the effort misguided, arguing that the retaliatory response creates a slippery slope that would erode the independent redistricting process California voters have chosen twice at the ballot box.

“When you fight fire with fire, the whole world burns,” said California Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), whose district is among those that would be overhauled under Proposition 50. “Newsom is trying to claim that Texas did a bad gerrymandering, but what California is doing is a good gerrymander because somehow it’s canceling it out … I just think gerrymandering is wrong. It’s wrong in Texas and it’s wrong in California.”

Kiley said Newsom never has been one to shy away from national attention “and for pursing explicitly partisan goals.”

“He’s certainly used this as an opportunity to do both of those things,” Kiley said.

Out of the gate, the redistricting plan had lackluster support. Then came the flood of ads by proponents peppered with talking points about Trump rigging the election.

Supporters of Proposition 50 took in more than four times the amount that opponents raised in recent weeks, according to campaign finance reports filed with the state by the three main committees campaigning about the measure. Supporters of Proposition 50 raised so much money that Newsom told them “you can stop donating.”

Political analysts said the redistricting fight has given Newsom what every ambitious politician craves: a narrative. It’s allowed him to cast himself as a defender of democracy while reenergizing donors. That message sharpened when Trump administration officials said they’d monitor polling sites in several California counties at the state GOP’s request, prompting Newsom to accuse the Trump administration of “voter intimidation.”

Republican strategist Rob Stutzman said the campaign gave Newsom something he’d struggled to find: “an authentic confrontation” with Trump that resonates beyond California.

“And I think it’s worked well for him nationally,” Stutzman said. “I think it’s been great for him in some ways, regardless of what happens, but if it does lose, it’ll hurt the brand that he can win and there will be a lot of disgruntled donors.”

While Newsom has framed the measure as good for the country, Stutzman said it’s clear that Proposition 50 has been particularly good for the governor.

“He’s used it for his own purposes very, very effectively,” Stutzman said. “If he becomes the [presidential] nominee, you could look back and say this was an important part of him getting there.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c23c70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5869x3081+0+459/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F51%2F437d04d84f3c88727e19fcc4fe30%2F2231388676.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:32.118738

Portuguese utility EDP SA says the outlook for investing in US renewable energy has become significantly clearer, easing concerns that followed the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“The situation has become much more stable,” Chief Executive Officer Miguel Stilwell de Andrade said on Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview in New York. “There was a lot of uncertainty, certainly at the beginning of the year, in terms of the policies. Now at least we have visibility, with the Big Beautiful Bill.”

The comments come after Trump’s attempts to stall offshore wind projects forced EDP and its Ocean Winds joint-venture partner Engie SA of France to announce impairments in February. Denmark’s Orsted A/S only recently won a court ruling to resume work on its nearly completed Rhode Island wind farm.

Since starting his second term in January, Trump has issued a series of orders against the offshore wind industry, including halting new seabed leases and blocking federal permits for existing ones. Executives had expected projects that were already fully permitted would be spared from the administration’s hostility toward offshore wind.

Shares of EDP Renovaveis SA — the listed renewables arm of EDP — lost almost a third of their value earlier this year, hitting the lowest since 2018 in April, before rebounding more than 50%. Parent company EDP SA has also rallied, climbing about 35% from a more than six-year low in early April.

EDP has already poured more than $20 billion into US wind and solar projects and continues to see North America, along with Europe, as a core growth region. The company pledged earlier this year to keep adding renewable capacity, though at a slower pace than previously planned.

“We need a stable legislative framework to be able to invest, and I think that’s what we’re looking for,” the CEO said.

On Trump’s tariffs, d’Andrade said most of EDP’s supply chain is now based in the US as the company turns to domestically-made products, citing a framework agreement with panel manufacturer First Solar Inc. The underlying cost to produce solar panels in the US is maybe two times what it would cost elsewhere, according to the CEO.

“It’s more expensive than if you import it, although nowadays with the uncertainty around tariffs we prefer to pay that premium but ensure a stable supply chain,” d’Andrade said.

“China’s updated NDC is a significant moment in our collective climate effort.

China’s NDC will deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at an unprecedented scale and help accelerate the transition by lowering the cost of clean technologies and driving innovation.

Today’s news is another signal that the future global economy will run on clean energy.

NDCs will be among the most important policy documents this century because they can accelerate economic transformation, driving more economic growth, jobs, affordable and secure energy, cleaner air, and better health.

China, like so many other countries, sees a clear national interest in building a cleaner, more prosperous future, with President Xi noting at the Secretary-General's recent climate summit that ""green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time''.

Every day now, new NDCs are being submitted by economies around the world, and more are expected in the coming days.

In the past few weeks alone, we have also received new NDCs from: Indonesia, South Africa, Malaysia, Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Zambia, and Cabo Verde, adding to those previously submitted.

Recent data shows how far we’ve come and how much further we still have to go. But I’m encouraged by President Xi’s remarks at the recent climate summit, and reflected fully in today NDC submission, committing both to emissions reduction targets and saying that China will be striving to do better.

President Xi, like so many leaders, recognizes that change is happening fast, sometimes even faster than governments can account for.

In that light, I hope that the NDCs we receive will be a floor, not a ceiling for ambition. And that every country sees it in its interest to go further and faster, to protect all their people from worsening climate disasters, and reap the vast human and economic benefits of stronger climate action.”",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:32.501376

The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.
The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems.
Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.
“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.","Fission startup First American Nuclear Co. is developing a power plant, first using natural gas and then shifting to a reactor expected to run on fuel produced from its own nuclear waste.

The Indiana-based company expects to start delivering electricity in 2028 using gas, and then deploy its liquid-metal fast reactor by 2032, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Reinboth. The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

“Data centers are driving the demand for power,” he said.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.

CMS Energy pumped $15,000 into Protect MI Free Speech, the committee formed to oppose the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics ballot initiative. The other $15,000 backing the opposition campaign came from health insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which would also be prohibited from making campaign contributions under the proposal.

The Michiganders for Money Out of Politics framework would ban regulated utilities like Consumers Energy from giving money to state officeholders and political party committees. The prohibition would also extend to corporations with state or local government contracts worth more than $250,000 annually, like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Under the framework, dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofits – including a prominent one affiliated with Consumers Energy – would be required to disclose pre-election ad spending.

Organizers aim to gather 356,958 signatures from Michigan voters by late February to ensure their proposal can be put to voters on the November 2026 ballot. The coalition pushing the proposal includes Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians.

Utility influence is a key driver of ballot initiative

Consumers Energy and DTE Energy, Michigan’s two largest corporate monopoly utilities, are among the most influential political forces in the state. Through their Political Action Committees (PACs), the two utilities have reported more than $1.7 million in contributions to current elected officials across their political careers, according to an Energy and Policy Institute analysis of campaign finance reports.

The review found that 122 of 148 current state legislators – or 82 percent – have received utility PAC money. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tops the list with $151,315 in utility PAC giving through October 2025. She appoints the regulators who oversee Michigan utilities, and who determine how much they can raise rates and how much they can profit. These proceedings have grown increasingly contentious in recent years as Consumers Energy and DTE Energy seek frequent rate increases while customers experience frequent outages, relative to other utilities in the region.

Earlier this year, Whitmer faced blowback for effectively ousting a well-respected regulator, Alessandra Carreon, and replacing her with Shaquila Myers, a political ally who pushed for utility priorities in her previous role as a top legislative aide.

After Whitmer, Republican Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt – a Republican gubernatorial candidate – is next in line with $142,825 in utility PAC contributions through October 2025. Like their peers in other states, the Michigan utility PACs have historically given to elected officials in both parties, often funneling the most to those in leadership positions who have the most sway in shaping the legislative agenda.

To date, legislative efforts to rein in Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have largely stalled out, including a bill that would’ve restricted their political spending without the ballot drive now underway. Utility PAC giving has coincided with pivotal votes on key energy bills, prompting environmental justice and clean energy advocates to blame inaction on utilities’ outsize influence in Lansing.

“While Michigan families continue to pay the highest rates in the Midwest for the worst service, DTE and Consumers are writing check after check to lawmakers helping their CEOs protect this broken status quo,” Bob Allison, deputy director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said earlier this year. “Michiganders of all political stripes chafe at our elected leaders being so blatantly influenced by the very utilities they, by law, are responsible for overseeing on behalf of us.”

Utilities channel millions of dollars more through dark money groups

Beyond the contributions made through their PACs, both Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have funded dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations that amplify their political giving, or their senior employees have led those groups. By using dark money groups, corporate interests can make donations, in secret, that exceed campaign finance limits. The groups also place ads designed to influence election outcomes.

These 501(c)(4) nonprofits – notoriously secretive, and designed to obscure how the money flows – would face greater scrutiny, and exposure, if the proposed ballot initiative passes. It would mandate disclosures of ad spending in the leadup to elections, commonly placed in service of utility-friendly candidates and their preferred policy outcomes.

While the utilities have insisted such nonprofits operate separately from them, their ties are clear.

One such dark money group, Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME), has received over $43 million in contributions from Consumers Energy, whose executives and lobbyists sit on its board. CEME has contributed tens of millions of dollars to politically connected organizations over the past decade, while its spending on election season ads prompted a complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service that questioned the legality of CEME’s activities.

Likewise, DTE Energy lobbyists and executives comprise the board of Michigan Energy First (MEF), a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that has pumped millions of dollars into funds affiliated with state officials and into advertising campaigns designed to influence state elections and policy decisions. Records daylighted in a criminal court case earlier this year showed a DTE Energy staffer was coordinating dark money donations on behalf of MEF using her DTE email account.

For those watching Michigan politics in recent years, the links are not surprising. After former Michigan House Energy Chair Gary Glenn, a Republican, took a hard line against Consumers Energy and DTE Energy priorities and profits in 2018, utility-affiliated dark money groups spent an estimated $1 million on a campaign to unseat him – a massive amount for a single legislative race.

Glenn lost, and with CEME in particular sitting on a multimillion-dollar war chest, Consumers Energy continues to loom large in state politics. Its most recent tax filing shows CEME was holding onto $12.7 million in assets as of December 2023 – a sizable war chest given typical spending in legislative races. MEF reported $7.6 million in assets at the end of 2023.

“By hanging my hide on the wall, utilities will intimidate even more legislators. Many legislators walk around scared of their own shadow when it comes to utility lobbyists,” Glenn told Midwest Energy News after his loss. “I am more disappointed in that than I have been about having lost the race — the fact that they’ll be able to intimidate other lawmakers by pointing to what they did in my race.”

Since then, both utilities’ dark money affiliates have continued to run ads during campaign season. They have also quietly given hefty sums to groups affiliated with sitting elected officials and political parties, including Whitmer and former House Speaker Joe Tate, who presided over the House as utility accountability bills languished in 2023.

“It essentially amounts to legal bribery,” State Rep. Dylan Wegela, a Democrat who has supported restricting utility campaign spending, previously told the Detroit News. “How else can you explain our lack of action on holding DTE accountable, especially, considering it’s one of the most popular and important issues?”

Protect MI Free Speech cash flowing to dark money lawyer

In addition to reporting five-figure contributions from CMS Energy and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the disclosure filed last week by Protect MI Free Speech also detailed its spending so far.

Nearly 90 percent of the $30,000 raised so far – $26,525 – went to Eric Doster, an attorney who helps run CEME and MEF, the dark money nonprofits linked to Consumers Energy and DTE Energy. This spending covers legal fees, according to the filing.

Doster is also legal counsel for the Michigan Economic Development Foundation, a separate nonprofit facing scrutiny recently. The organization uses donations from large corporations – including Consumers Energy and DTE Energy – to fund Whitmer’s overseas trade trips, an arrangement critics say promotes inappropriate coziness between Whitmer and big business interests. Those with board seats got access to Whitmer and high-profile staff, plus billions of dollars in state economic development incentives in recent years, the Detroit News reported.

Doster’s wife, Mary, is listed in the filing as the “designated record keeper” for Protect MI Free Speech, and she lists her address as the Ingham County home she and Eric Doster share. Mary Doster is a GOP insider who has helped run campaigns for Republican candidates and causes in Michigan.

In addition to the fees paid to Doster, Protect MI Free Speech reported another $2,385 on legal fees paid to Dykema Gossett, a law firm that represents utilities and other corporate interests in Michigan.

The next required disclosure from Protect MI Free Speech is due Feb. 2.

This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.","This article was originally published on Waging Nonviolence.

“We have the groundwork in place to make solar power and renewable energy much more accessible than they are now,” celebrated climate activist Bill McKibben told people from all over the country on a Sept. 25 Zoom call.

The virtual gathering was organized by Third Act, a national organization of people over 60 confronting the climate crisis. It took place just days after a Third Act-coordinated nationwide day of action called Sun Day, which saw over 500 events in 49 states draw attention to renewable energy’s vast potential.

At a time when U.S. climate organizations are largely on the defensive, fighting the Trump administration’s rollbacks to climate action at the federal level, McKibben’s words underscored how Third Act has identified a rare opportunity to make real, short-term progress toward a clean energy future. The organization wants to remove local and state-level barriers that prevent people from harnessing the power of the sun.

“This is one area where we don’t have to wait,” said Third Act campaign strategist Jeremy Friedman. “You don’t have to wait for your state legislature to make things better, or for voters to throw out the politicians in Congress who repealed national climate legislation. We don’t have to wait for any policy change coming down from the top before we start taking action.”

Third Act calls its new campaign Simplify Solar. “It’s really more of a project than a single campaign,” Friedman said. “This is a decentralized effort, where volunteers will work at the local level to advance individual campaigns in their own communities.”

If successful, Simplify Solar could show how climate activists can still move the ball forward for clean energy, even at a time of unprecedented attacks on federal progress.

Removing barriers

“Solar is no longer ‘alternative’ energy,” said Deborah Moore, another Third Act strategist. “It’s really the best way to go.”

Solar energy is not only one of the cleanest forms of electricity, it’s also cheaper than energy from fossil fuels in much of the world, including large parts of the United States. Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S. Many of these rules constitute unnecessary red tape that prevents people from powering their homes with clean, affordable energy.

By challenging governments to remove these barriers, Third Act activists believe they can help clear a real roadblock to the widespread adoption of clean energy — and there isn’t much the Trump administration can do about it. The organization’s first step is gathering on-the-ground information about current regulations.

Currently, there is no single, publicly accessible database about how different towns, cities and counties handle solar permitting. This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.

“One of the barriers to the uptake of solar is poor information,” said Karen Gladding, a member of the coordinating committee for Third Act D.C. “And where do you go, except to a local installer? And then immediately you’re under pressure to sign a contract.”

This fall, Third Act is organizing a series of virtual trainings to help volunteers learn how to track down information about current policies pertaining to solar in their communities, then crowd source the information into a central database. This will provide a foundation for the next part of the project: persuading governments to remove unnecessary regulations.

“At the outset, we’re not treating city and county officials as targets who necessarily need to be pushed hard,” Friedman said. “Some may be allies waiting in the wings, who are ready to be invited into a partnership by our volunteers. A first step is to see what officials are already willing to work with us.”

Once activists identify where the rules for home solar need to be changed, and which lawmakers are receptive to helping, it will be time to put pressure on those decision makers who are more recalcitrant. This will likely involve some creative activism.

“I call it bureaucracy theater,” Friedman said. “We set up some desks along a sidewalk, complete with stacks of paper and a musty, white-wigged administrator behind the counter. Then, a volunteer playing the part of a beleaguered city resident goes from table to table, trying to get their solar permit approved and getting nowhere.”

Friedman said this kind of street theater is “a way to poke a little fun at the experience of navigating bureaucracy in the modern world.” The message is serious, though: Today, regulations governing rooftop solar aren’t just an inconvenience, but a genuine roadblock to progress on climate change.

“An exciting thing about this work is it’s something people can join from anywhere,” Friedman said. “Unlike so many other campaigns, you can find meaningful ways to participate whether you live in a red, blue or purple state.”

Spanning political divides

“Too often in politics, there’s an overwhelming focus on so-called purple states,” Friedman said. “This leaves people who don’t live in those states without many ways to contribute. Progressives in blue areas assume their state governments are already doing the right thing, while those in red states feel their representatives will never listen to them.”

The issues Simplify Solar seeks to tackle are less straightforward. For example, blue states may have some of the most burdensome regulations holding solar back.

“Up until now, one of the worst states in the country for putting solar on your roof has been New Jersey,” Friedman said. “They actually have more state incentives to make solar cheaper than many other states — but the difficulty of the permitting process makes it so solar is still more expensive in New Jersey than neighboring Pennsylvania. That’s wasted money people are being forced to pay for very little reward.”

A bill passed by the New Jersey legislature this year will help streamline the process for approving home solar installations, assuming it’s signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy. However, the difficulties solar advocates have encountered there until recently illustrates how barriers to renewables can arise in unlikely places.

Simplify Solar isn’t about complete deregulation.

“We need to ensure solar installations are safe,” Friedman said. “But once that’s taken care of, there doesn’t have to be a lot of additional government intervention.”

Renewable advocates in politically red states can also take action, sometimes at the local level. Red states often contain urban centers where progressive lawmakers may be receptive to climate activists’ message.

Beyond this, the fact that simplifying solar is about reducing government regulation suggests at least the potential for genuinely bipartisan solutions. This year, Utah — one of the most conservative states in the country — passed a “balcony solar bill,” allowing people to plug small solar systems directly into home electrical outlets without additional fees.

Simplify Solar’s state-level work is entering a quiet period, since most state legislatures meet mainly in the first half of the year. The project will use this time to collect more information about what state regulatory frameworks could most likely be improved.

“Going into January and February, we’ll know a lot more about where legislators are willing and interested in introducing better laws,” Friedman said.

Once state legislative sessions start, Third Act members expect to contact and meet with lawmakers, testify at legislative hearings and engage in more creative kinds of activism. These same types of action will be going on at the local level.

There’s reason to think the organization’s specific volunteer power base might be uniquely suited to push this momentum forward.

Acting now

“Third Actors are especially well positioned for this work, in some ways,” Friedman said. “Our volunteers are more likely to be homeowners than younger people. They’re more likely to have lived in one place for a long time, giving them a relationship with their town and local politics. Those who are retired also likely have flexible daytime hours for interacting with officials.”

Third Act was founded with the goal of marshalling the resources and creativity of people over 60 to tackle climate change. This makes it stand out from other climate groups that have tended to be led by young people, and which in some cases explicitly focus on engaging students.

Young activists will likely always play an important role in the climate movement. But few high school or college students have experience navigating local bureaucracies to make home improvements. Third Act’s volunteers are more likely to be familiar with these processes.

Of course, older people also bring other valuable life experiences to the table. “We have members who are retired city employees, who are former elected officials, and folks who’ve been lawyers,” Friedman says. “Now, they can draw on all those years of experience to inform their activism.”

There are many different ways for volunteers to plug into Third Act’s campaigns. “A lot of how people engage will depend on temperament and ability,” Friedman said. “We’ve got folks with mobility issues, for example, who maybe can’t go testify at City Hall, but who can do research from home on existing local solar policies and share what they find with others.”

If successful, this work will lead to improved accessibility of home renewable energy systems for people all over the United States. This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.

“With climate change, of course, we’re up against a real timeline to prevent the crisis from worsening,” Friedman said. “What’s so appealing about this project is it’s an opportunity to cut costs for solar no one wanted to pay — and to do it right now.”

Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase.

Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans.","Enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits (PTCs) are set to expire at the end of 2025, and without congressional action, millions of Americans face sharply higher health insurance premiums and potential coverage loss, with significant consequences for household and federal budgets, according to stakeholders.

Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face steep premium increases in 2026 as the enhanced PTCs are set to expire. The enhancements, which were enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), will end unless Congress intervenes.

Background

The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace. As explained in a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, which was initially published earlier this year and last updated in September, the credit works by capping the amount a household is expected to contribute toward a “benchmark” silver-level health plan, with the government subsidy covering the rest.

Prior to 2021, eligibility was limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), creating a “subsidy cliff” where a small income increase could make a family entirely ineligible for assistance. The ARPA and IRA enhancements temporarily eliminated this cliff by extending eligibility to those with incomes above 400% of the FPL and made the subsidies more generous overall.

These changes fueled record marketplace enrollment, which, according to a February 2025 explainer from the Commonwealth Fund, grew from 12 million people in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025.

Rising Costs, Coverage Losses

If the enhancements expire, premiums for marketplace enrollees will rise sharply. A report published October 29 by Gideon Lukens and Elizabeth Zhang at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) projects that the amount the average enrollee pays will more than double. For example, a family of four making $130,000 (about 404% of the FPL) would see their monthly premium jump from $921 to $1,998 — an annual increase of about $12,900.

This “rate shock” is expected to push millions out of the insurance market. Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in a June 2024 letter from Director Phillip Swagel to House Republican leaders, estimated that the number of uninsured people would rise by 3.8 million, on average, in each year over the 2026-2034 period.

Subsequent analyses showed a growing consensus around that number. The Commonwealth Fund’s Senior Scholar Sara Collins and Program Assistant Carson Richards projected that 4 million people would likely become uninsured. The Economic Security Project forecasted that 4.2 million people will lose coverage.

An analysis from the Urban Institute, authored in September by Senior Fellow Fredric Blavin and Principal Research Associate Michael Simpson, projects an even larger impact, with 4.8 million more adults becoming uninsured in 2026. The authors note this figure is larger than prior-year estimates partly because marketplace enrollment in 2025 was substantially higher than expected.

Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans. Their loss would mean skyrocketing premiums,” she said. “This will hit middle-class Americans, small business owners, farmers and people [aged] 55 and older, the hardest.”

Budget Forecast

Swagel had found that making the enhanced PTC permanent would increase the federal budget deficit by an estimated $335 billion over the 2025-2034 period. This net cost reflects a complex shift in coverage, including a projected 3.5 million decrease in employment-based coverage as some workers switch to more affordable marketplace options, he wrote last June.

The Urban Institute’s more current analysis highlights that allowing the credits to expire would create other economic pressures, even while avoiding direct federal spending. The report projects that the resulting increase in the uninsured population would lead to a $7.7 billion increase in the demand for uncompensated care in 2026.

This cost, the report claims, is not a federal budget line item but is instead absorbed by hospitals, physicians, and state and local governments, placing a financial strain on the broader health care system.

At last Wednesday’s rally, Jennifer Flynn Walker, co-director of campaigns for Popular Democracy in Action, told attendees outside the Capitol building, “Families are struggling to pay rent and keep their health care while [President Trump] demolishes the East Wing to build a $300 million ballroom for his billionaire friends, instead of reopening the government and fixing the health care crisis affecting millions of us.”

In January, after the Los Angeles wildfires became the most costly in history, the House passed the Fix Our Forests Act with significant bipartisan support.
Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge.","In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry advanced a bill to address the growing threat of wildfires. There is now broad consensus that the poor health of our forests are threatening communities, public health and emissions goals.

But, as the bipartisan, bicameral Fix Our Forests Act proves, we don’t simply have to accept this as our new normal.

Recent fire seasons have been devastating — burning millions of acres, destroying thousands of homes and putting lives at risk. The growing wildfire challenge is also threatening climate goals, as forest fires increasingly become a source of emissions.

In 2020, for example, one wildfire season in California produced twice the emissions that the state had reduced between 2003 and 2019 combined, effectively wiping out 16 years of progress. Similarly, Canada’s 2023 wildfires released more carbon in just a few months than Russia or Japan emits from all fossil fuel use in an entire year.

While climate change plays a role in wildfires increasing in size, severity and frequency, the main driver is decades of poor forest management, which has left forests dense, overgrown and unhealthy. Under these conditions, our forests become tinderboxes, ready to ignite at any moment. Restoring them to a healthy state is crucial for protecting both our communities and our environment.

Unfortunately, many critical projects needed to restore our forests get stalled in lengthy review processes and legal challenges, unable to break ground before the next catastrophic wildfire hits.

For example, it’s not uncommon for the Forest Service to propose a project and start the National Environmental Policy Act process, only for an uncontrolled wildfire to burn the area before the environmental review is complete. It’s not surprising considering the fact that it takes an average of nearly five years to simply start a prescribed fire project, and forest management projects face more litigation under the act than any other project type.

Still, not all news is bad — in at least one case, we may have learned a valuable lesson. Through the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, enacted in 2016, Congress established a categorical exclusion for forest thinning projects of up to 10,000 acres within the Lake Tahoe Basin.

This policy allowed the Forest Service to implement critical forest treatments quickly. When the Caldor Fire ignited in 2021 and ultimately burned over 220,000 acres, these treatments played a crucial role in protecting South Lake Tahoe, bringing the fire to the ground and enabling fire officials to bring it under control.

Now, through the Fix Our Forests Act, Congress is looking to extend this model to the nation’s highest-risk forests, expanding the size of forest health projects eligible for a categorical exclusion from 3,000 acres up to 10,000 acres. The proposal draws on successes such as the Lake Tahoe Basin, and even former Forest Service Chief Randy Moore has expressed support for efforts to expedite critical forest management projects.

On top of streamlining the review process for forest management projects in high-risk areas, the bill establishes a Fireshed Center to improve coordination across federal, state, tribal and local partners. It also supports community wildfire initiatives, including home hardening and local resilience planning, while investing in reseeding and reforestation capabilities to restore healthy forests post-wildfire.

In January, after the Los Angeles wildfires became the most costly in history, the House passed the Fix Our Forests Act with significant bipartisan support. Now, as the year comes to a close, the Senate has the chance to advance this bill and deliver real solutions for communities across the country.

Wildfires have long been a part of life in the U.S., especially in the West, but we don’t have to simply accept the growing threat they pose. Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge. We cannot wait for another disaster to spur us to act.

Camacho, Brian Dabbs, Peter Behr",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/did-trump-just-pick-a-nuclear-national-champion/,"Westinghouse Electric got a leg up on its competition last week when the Trump administration announced a partnership with the nuclear giant to deploy $80 billion of new reactors.
Jacopo Buongiorno, director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the deal indicates the government’s preference for Westinghouse as a purveyor of large, conventional nuclear reactors.
Buongiorno noted that no other American nuclear firms are actively selling and building large reactors.
Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie expects U.S. nuclear generation to grow 27 percent from 2035 to 2060 due largely to the proliferation of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.
ClearView estimated that $80 billion could support anywhere from 5 to 11 new reactors at 1 gigawatt each.","Westinghouse Electric got a leg up on its competition last week when the Trump administration announced a partnership with the nuclear giant to deploy $80 billion of new reactors.

The agreement is President Donald Trump’s latest move to influence the energy sector — namely, by giving the U.S. government equity in private ventures. The government would arrange financing and permits in return for a 20 percent stake in Westinghouse’s profits.

“They’re converting loan and grant programs into equity stakes,” said Brent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania who researches political economy and business-state interaction. “That’s one way that we can think about this as both continuity with the Biden administration, but also an important precedent-setting disjuncture in terms of the equity stakes.”

As of October, the administration had taken stakes in five public companies, including semiconductor manufacturer Intel and rare earths miner MP Materials. Upon the Westinghouse announcement, ClearView Energy Partners said the “scale of the Trump Administration’s energy sector-directed industrial policy seems to be accelerating.”

“We would suggest the Administration may have identified Westinghouse as a possible ‘national champion’ within the U.S. power sector, which could influence the competitive landscape for domestic nuclear generation and energy operations writ large,” ClearView analysts wrote.

Jacopo Buongiorno, director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the deal indicates the government’s preference for Westinghouse as a purveyor of large, conventional nuclear reactors.

“It gives the perception that the government picked a winner, but it is the de facto winner in that category,” Buongiorno said.

Buongiorno noted that no other American nuclear firms are actively selling and building large reactors. While dozens of firms are looking to build midsize, small and micro reactors, he said, there are “other markets” for them.

“You have chemical plants; you have steel mills, concrete factories. They need heat and electricity, and maybe they need 100 megawatt equivalent of heat and 50 megawatt of electricity, or whatever it is,” Buongiorno said. “In that case, it doesn’t make any sense to put an AP1000. You put a small modular reactor.”

AP1000s produce roughly 1,000 megawatts of electricity, while small modular reactors generate anywhere from 12 MW to 300 MW. A typical Amazon data center consumes 300 to 500 MW.

Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie expects U.S. nuclear generation to grow 27 percent from 2035 to 2060 due largely to the proliferation of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers. Many technology firms are turning specifically to nuclear to power their growing fleets in hopes that its low emissions will satisfy their sustainability goals without sacrificing reliability.

Westinghouse Electric’s owners, Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management, said in their announcement that the agreement with the U.S. government aims to boost the American nuclear industry, ensure energy sovereignty, support AI-driven data centers and potentially create thousands of jobs.

Under the new partnership, if the U.S. enters into agreements to build $80 billion of nuclear reactors, the government will receive 20 percent of profits “in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse,” according to Cameco’s press release.

If the government makes a final investment decision by January 2029 and an initial public offering valuation for Westinghouse is expected at $30 billion or more, the government would be “entitled to require” an IPO. In that case, the U.S. would then have at least five years to purchase equity equal to 20 percent of Westinghouse’s value, after deducting the $17.5 billion.

Hazy details

The Trump administration’s pursuit of equity distinguishes its approach from previous instances of government ownership in private companies, such as during the New Deal and in the wake of World War II, Cebul said.

He also noted that in the 1980s and 1990s, states from Ohio to Arkansas set up public venture capital funds, pitching them as a way to create well-paying jobs.

In some instances, states reserved the right to participate in managerial decisions, Cebul said, but “I don’t know of any cases where the state actually stepped in to put their thumb on the scale.”

In the past, the U.S. government has also effectively created monopolies by awarding contracts to only one company. Cebul pointed to Boeing’s position in the aircraft industry and Lockheed Martin’s dominance in the defense sector as examples.

“Contracting is not the same thing as taking an equity stake, but it’s a distinction that is far more of a degree than a categorical difference,” Cebul said.

But much is still unknown about the deal with Westinghouse. Crucial details — such as sites, customers and builders — have not been publicly released.

“The announcement was very short on detail, and those details will have to be revealed soon for people to remain excited,” Buongiorno said.

ClearView analysts walked through the math of the IPO: At a $30 billion valuation, the agreement could let the government acquire a stake worth $6 billion by expending roughly $2.5 billion.

Funding sources aren’t specified. ClearView points to the Department of Energy’s loan-guarantee authority as a plausible tool to help arrange financing. The firm also highlights a new U.S.–Japan deal that sets aside up to $332 billion for critical energy infrastructure in the U.S., with a Japanese document sizing a Westinghouse provision at up to $100 billion.

ClearView estimated that $80 billion could support anywhere from 5 to 11 new reactors at 1 gigawatt each.

On its website, Westinghouse indicates that the new reactors could power more than AI: “Supporting America’s leadership in AI is a core use case, but the power produced will also meet broader increases in energy demand and bolster energy security.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/7d/92/57e0d7734844a2caf7d24af0f240/nuclear-plant-georgia-35574.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:04:58.126820

Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said the current environmental governance system is “not fit for purpose and failing everyone”.

He described an “endless list” of examples of failed environmental governance, including Lough Neagh, the illegal dump site at Mobuoy, as well as nature decline, and air quality.

He urged MLAs for support as he asks the Stormont Executive to agree in principle to the establishment of an independent, environmental protection agency in Northern Ireland.

“Northern Ireland is a laggard in relation to the environment and, when I stand up and say that, and look to take action on that, I get vilified. Vilified because people are not prepared to take difficult decision,” he said.

“This is a point of decision for this place and people need to back me.”

Last month, a review of environmental governance in the region recommended independent regulation to include oversight of air and water quality, waste management, nature and biodiversity and the marine environment.

The panel noted the region’s environment is under “mounting stress”, with signals which “cannot be ignored”.

Mr Muir said this “critical issue cannot continue to be dodged”.

“I firmly believe that now is a pivotal moment for all of us, and that we should establish an independent environmental protection agency as recommended by the independent panel,” he said.

“We are witnessing more and more visible signs that our environment is struggling, and we need to take decisions now to change course.

“The costs of inaction are simply too great. We should look no further than Lough Neagh or the illegal dump at Mobuoy, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds to resolve.

“Failed environmental governance and non compliance with environmental law results in huge costs to the public purse and, so, we must invest now in the longer term to make those savings.

“Inaction also leads to increasingly degraded eco systems, public health risks, impacts on people’s livelihoods and lost opportunities for sustainable growth.

“Without decisive reform, Northern Ireland will continue to fall behind in meeting its environmental obligations and the public will continue to pay the price in terms of quality of life and economic resilience.”

Daniel McCrossan, from the SDLP Opposition, pressed Mr Muir for a time scale on when the environmental protection agency will be active, pointing out the minister is two years into his post.

Mr Muir said once he has secured support in principle, then the process will move to the public consultation.

“If people believe in this, they need to work with me in relation to the implementation of that so we can have this legislation by the end of the mandate,” he said.

“I’m determined to make progress on this and people need to back me.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/04/13/1a4f797dec1aeb9f7e628673f90f313fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzYyMzQ3Mzc2-2.79656347.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:13.259953

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

READ MORE: Trump called climate change a ‘con job’ at the United Nations. Here are the facts and context

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, Tuesday’s U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report says.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. “It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise.”

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.1 to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer.

“We are making progress,” U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press.

“We have to go faster,” she added.

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

The project — formally known as the Fairfield-Congress Railroad Transmission Line — has generated intense local pushback over the impact that the transmission line would have as it passes over homes, businesses and churches, suspended from giant steel monopoles. Utility officials have countered that the proposed alternatives, including burying the line underground, would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project’s costs, which would be paid back by customers across Connecticut.

Last month, the Connecticut Siting Council voted 5-3 to reject the project, with several members reversing their previous positions of support.

“As the Council has repeatedly found, there is a strong public need for this Project, which will replace 60-year-old, deteriorated UI transmission infrastructure, which sits atop 100-year-old, [state] owned railroad catenaries,” the company said in a formal petition asking the Siting Council to reconsider its ruling.

Additionally, the petition argued that the council’s sudden reversal left company officials “with no guidance as to what, if any, issues the Council had with the proposed solution to the important public need the Project sought to address.”

While the request is unlikely to yield a different outcome, it is necessary for United Illuminating to exhaust its options before the Siting Council in order to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision.

The company gave further indication that it is pursing a legal appeal last month when its attorneys sent letters to members of the Siting Council, as well as local leaders in Bridgeport and Fairfield, advising them to preserve any documents or communications related to the project.

The letter, known as a “litigation hold,” often serves as a precursor to a formal lawsuit.

Officials in Fairfield and Bridgeport did not immediately offer comment Monday on UI’s latest request. A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont’s office declined to comment.

The Fairfield-Congress transmission line was previously the subject of a lawsuit brought by officials in Bridgeport and Fairfield, along with other local critics, challenging the Siting Council’s decision to propose and approve an alternative plan that moved the proposed route of the transmission line from the south side of the Metro North railroad tracks to the north.

In April, a judge ruled that the council has overstepped its authority by modifying UI’s proposal with its own route.

The decision led the Siting Council to reconsider the original 7.3 mile route as proposed by UI in 2023. Over the next few months, the members of the council publicly wavered over their decision, holding a series of votes in which they went back and forth over whether to approve the project.

After a nonbinding straw vote was held in September in which a majority of the council indicated their support for the project, opponents declared the process “tainted” as a result of several members switching their positions from an earlier vote in June.

Those concerns evaporated, however, after the council switched positions again to reject UI’s proposal during the final and biding vote held on Oct. 16.

Instead, it is now the utility that is protesting the process. In its filing on Monday, the company stated that the Siting Council “acted illegally and arbitrarily in flipping its vote with absolutely no reasons provided.”

The transmission line is also of interest to communities outside of Bridgeport and Fairfield due to the construction costs that will be recouped from utility customers.

UI has estimated that the cost of building its proposed overhead transmission line will be around $300 million. That amount can be spread among the nearly 14 million electric customers in six states under rules established by the regional grid operator, ISO New England.

If the Siting Council forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in Connecticut alone, according to ISO NE.

Burying the line could increase the costs of the project by up to $500 million, according to UI’s estimates. Critics, however, argue that the utility’s estimates are wildly inflated based on the costs of other recently completed underground transmission lines in the area.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6500-771x5781762271054.jpg?h=59e55433&itok=FimF9YnS,N,,2025-11-04 11:04:23.844490

Manufacturers are feeling the effects of more than $24 billion worth of renewable energy project cancellations this year.

The latest data, compiled by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, shows $1.6 billion worth of cancellations in September after $7 billion in June alone. This affects major manufacturers and technology suppliers for electric vehicles, solar, wind, battery, storage and related components.

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

All these project closures combined have affected an estimated 21,000 jobs this year, with more than 5,000 cuts in June and 3,000 in September.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report. These are “conservative numbers,” he added, because they exclude construction labor and many canceled projects never shared investment figures or job estimates when they were initially announced.

“The primary factor contributing to the billions of dollars in project cancellations this year is policy uncertainty caused by federal repeals,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Policy shift

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, rescinded several tax credits and incentive programs for renewable energy initiatives.

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act. This led projects that were built on and heavily dependent on this funding to be paused, postponed, canceled or moved offshore.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.

“With energy demand surging due to AI, data centers and EV charging infrastructure, scaling back clean energy development will constrain supply, strain the grid and drive up prices for households and businesses alike,” he added. “In 2024, renewables accounted for more than 92% of new power generation — slowing or reversing that trend will leave the country paying more for less energy.”

Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.
And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.","As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Key Takeaways

Trump’s deregulation push could cost drivers more. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance — the opposite of what Trump says he’s aiming for.

Automakers hate the whiplash. Constantly shifting climate rules — from Obama to Trump to Biden and back — have made it nearly impossible for car companies to plan, adding costs that get passed on to buyers.

Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls.

The US is falling behind. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump’s policies discourage EV investment.

The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.

That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s policies are costing drivers more

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.

Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. “It’s not only hurting in terms of setting us back with regard to decarbonization of the transportation sector, but the cost to consumers in the United States.”",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Vox_Cars_GettyImages-97219709.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:16.326766

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.
According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.
Disclosure: Texas 2036, Texas Rural Water Association and Texas Water Foundation have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state's leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state's water supply.

Texas' water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall's ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state's water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

""There's going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,"" said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. ""But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.""

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

""This is not economically feasible otherwise,"" said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. ""These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.""

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

""That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it's bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,"" said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. ""All the programs are so oversubscribed that it's not like that was new money for new fun projects.""

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

""Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,"" said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. ""Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.""

Clearer accounting wanted

There's rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

""The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,"" Mazur said. ""And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.""

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

""There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,"" Fowler said. ""But I don't think they're being irresponsible.""

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

""I think it's going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they're completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,"" Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

""As great as this billion is, and if we're going to get it every year, it's never going to be enough,"" Fowler said. ""We're probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we're seeing is we're not able to meet the demand we have.""

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board's own estimates in the state's 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

""I don't think we're going to end up with a scenario where there's just money sitting around not being used,"" Schlessinger said. ""My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.""

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said.
Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand.
“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.","Manufacturers are feeling the effects of more than $24 billion worth of renewable energy project cancellations this year.

The latest data, compiled by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, shows $1.6 billion worth of cancellations in September after $7 billion in June alone. This affects major manufacturers and technology suppliers for electric vehicles, solar, wind, battery, storage and related components.

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

All these project closures combined have affected an estimated 21,000 jobs this year, with more than 5,000 cuts in June and 3,000 in September.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report. These are “conservative numbers,” he added, because they exclude construction labor and many canceled projects never shared investment figures or job estimates when they were initially announced.

“The primary factor contributing to the billions of dollars in project cancellations this year is policy uncertainty caused by federal repeals,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Policy shift

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, rescinded several tax credits and incentive programs for renewable energy initiatives.

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act. This led projects that were built on and heavily dependent on this funding to be paused, postponed, canceled or moved offshore.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gk1hbdP9NFoKPfUtYjgIuMD6_XpaStFGe3kSfBBPRCc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjM2NjI2MDU3X0VqV05ZbkMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:01.645306

Further, U.S. solar cell production capacity has more than tripled this year, rising from 1 GW to 3.2 GW.
SEIA officials said that the U.S. solar manufacturing pipeline remains robust.
Currently, there is 23 GW of solar module capacity, over 34 GW of solar cell capacity, 25 GW of inverter capacity, and 95 GWh of battery cell capacity either under construction or announced.","With Corning building the largest solar ingot and wafer facility in the country, co-located with the company’s polysilicon facility in Hemlock, Michigan, the United States now has the capacity to produce every major component of the solar supply chain, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

New data from SEIA shows that the entire solar supply chain has been reshored and U.S. manufacturing capacity has grown across every segment of the solar and storage supply chain.

So far in 2025, 65 new or expanded solar and storage facilities have come online, totaling some $4.5 billion in private investment. However, SEIA points out that more than 100 factories and over $31 billion in the pipeline could be at risk if the Trump administration continues its attacks on solar energy.

This year, U.S. manufacturing capacity has increased across every major segment of the solar and storage supply chain, according to SEIA’s Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard. As of October 2025, the United States has surpassed 60 gigawatts (GW) of domestic solar module production capacity, a 37 percent increase from December 2024.

Further, U.S. solar cell production capacity has more than tripled this year, rising from 1 GW to 3.2 GW. In addition, battery cell manufacturing for stationary electricity storage applications has risen to over 21 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA, said. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers, and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

Also, U.S. manufacturing of inverters, which converts electricity produced by solar into usable power, has grown by nearly 50 percent since the end of last year, with capacity surging from 19 GW to 28 GW. Additionally, U.S. mounting system manufacturing has increased 14 percent and added 23 new factories.

SEIA officials said that the U.S. solar manufacturing pipeline remains robust. Currently, there is 23 GW of solar module capacity, over 34 GW of solar cell capacity, 25 GW of inverter capacity, and 95 GWh of battery cell capacity either under construction or announced. However, Trump Administration policies, regulations, and trade actions which have contributed to industry uncertainty could stall this progress and reduce demand for the products made by American solar and storage manufacturers.

Wired for Profit: First in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.

MCCALLA — Mary Rosenboom is fed up.

Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.

Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.

Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.

None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.

Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.

So why are power bills so high?

Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.

Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.

Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.

The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.

That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.

“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”

Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.

In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.

“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.

But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.

Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.

Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.

Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.

Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.

The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.

Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.

The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.

The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.

Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost no public participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.

The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.

“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.

“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”

And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.

“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”

Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.

The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.

Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”

Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.

Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.

Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.

Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs. Instead, the PSC’s press office provided written responses to questions.

When reporters reach out to the agency seeking information, the answers come with this warning:

“All verbal and/or written responses provided by the staff of the Alabama Public Service Commission (“APSC”) are for informational purposes only and may not be the subject of quotation(s) attributed to staff in any public medium without the express permission of the APSC.”

A profitable change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.

The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.

At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.

“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.

Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.

Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.

The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.

“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.

Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If that’s not regulatory capture . . .”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.

He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.

“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.

A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.

Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.

“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.

An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.

The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.

“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.

Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.

“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data center angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.

“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”

Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.

In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.

“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.

Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”

Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.

“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”

Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.

During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.

The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.

“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”

If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.

“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on fossil fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.

The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.

Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.

The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.

And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A new profit formula review — with no public input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.

In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.

Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.

Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.

“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,"" Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

The EU's long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves, and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia's war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, disturbed environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her 2019 Green Deal. But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovreignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU's climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joseph Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU's commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

“Today is about the level of ambition, and it’s about standing ground and not only sticking to talking the talk when it is easy, but also walking the walk when it becomes difficult,” Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari said in Brussels.

The COP30 summit in Brazil is scheduled to take place Nov. 10-21.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/PDTN/87082759007-ap-25308311803962.jpg?crop=7280,4095,x0,y728&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-04 11:03:05.705272

Ford is wasting no time in developing its upcoming affordable electric pickup truck, which is expected to have a starting price of about $30,000. After revealing very little information about the vehicle itself back in August, when it focused on the potentially game-changing assembly procedures, the American automaker is back with new details.

The first vehicle based on Ford’s new Universal EV platform (UEV) is already being tested in the real world, and the component sourcing is nearly complete, according to the company’s head honcho, Jim Farley.

What’s more, the Louisville plant in Kentucky, which used to assemble the gas-powered Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will start getting new equipment installed later this year. Around the same time, the automaker will also start churning out lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells at its battery manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, which will power the entry-level EV.

“This is not a distant plan, it's right around the corner for us at Ford,” Farley said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call late last month. “Sourcing is at 95% complete now. We are testing vehicles. Will begin installing equipment in Louisville for the UEV later this year, and we are on track to start production of our LFP cells at the Marshall, Michigan, plant later this year.”

It’s no secret that Ford has postponed several new electric models, but it has done so to fast-track its revolutionary new platform, which does away with the traditional assembly line. In the new system, the rear, center and front sections of the vehicle are assembled on separate lines and then joined together toward the end. The company, which stands by its 2027 reveal deadline, says this new method saves a lot of money and makes manufacturing faster.

As for the batteries that will power the new Maverick-sized pickup, the entry-level version is poised to get LFP cells instead of the more traditional nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type. LFP batteries are cheaper to make and can withstand full charging cycles more often, but they offer less energy density compared to a similarly-sized NMC pack. Whatever the chemistry, though, the carmaker made it clear that the batteries will run at 400 volts, and not 800 volts.

Ford hasn’t revealed exact numbers yet, but it mentioned that it’s aiming for a battery that’s 15% smaller than that of the Chinese-made BYD Atto electric crossover, which would mean a capacity of around 51 kilowatt-hours. That’s not a lot by modern standards, but if the company manages to keep the weight down, the secretive new EV could have just enough range for most people.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8qOvq/s1/a-teaser-of-ford-s-30-000-electric-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 08:57:40.844607

The offer has been extended after the federal credit expired, and has been renewed until November 30, according to its website.
Production Ramp-up The EV maker is targeting production of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles in 2025, a target that was revised to include a lower-end in August.","Lucid Motors sold an estimated 935 vehicles in the US in October, with 250 Gravity SUVs and 685 Air sedans, according to Motor Intelligence data released Monday.

The figures, which Lucid has previously disputed in recent months as inaccurate, show a 40% increase from 670 vehicles a year earlier and a 3% gain from September’s 910 units.

The electric-vehicle maker, which reports only global quarterly figures, delivered 4,078 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter.

Motor Intelligence‘s US estimates for the period totaled 2,793 units, based on monthly tallies of 890 in July, 993 in August and 910 in September.

A Lucid spokesperson last month called Motor Intelligence‘s estimates “inaccurate and not even in the ballpark.”

The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the October data.

Motor Intelligence estimated that Lucid delivered 910 vehicles in September, following 993 in August and 890 in July.

This indicates that Lucid‘s total US deliveries for the third quarter would be at 2,793 vehicles. Last month, the brand reported 4,078 vehicles delivered globally during the same period.

October figures represent a 40% jump year over year, from 670 vehicles, and a slight 3% increase from September, by 25 units.

Sequential Growth Despite EV Credit Expiry

The numbers contradict the overall tendency of a sales slowdown after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30.

After a new record with third quarter deliveries, Tesla saw its registrations tumble 31% sequentially and 24% year over year, according to the platform.

The Elon Musk-led company sold 40,650 vehicles in October, about 18,000 units below September.

Detroit automaker Ford lost 60% of electric vehicle sales from September to October, and 25% from a year ago.

Lucid and Rivian (whose registrations declined sequentially but increased year over year) were less affected by the expiration of the federal EV tax credit than other automakers.

Both companies offer vehicles that were priced above the program’s eligibility thresholds.

The Lucid Air starts at $70,900, exceeding the $55,000 cap for sedans, while the Gravity (in its Grand Touring trim, the only version available at the time) starts at $94,900, well above the $80,000 cap for trucks and SUVs.

Because these price caps did not apply to leased vehicles, both California-based EV makers relied on leasing to enable customers to benefit from the incentive.

Lucid Offers

In addition, Lucid started offering in 2023 a $7,500 credit on Lucid Air purchases through financing, to offset the lack of federal credit eligibility.

The offer has been extended after the federal credit expired, and has been renewed until November 30, according to its website.

The company also set a 0.99% APR on customers buying the sedan.

The company currently features several Gravity units in its inventory, across multiple US states. Prices start from $96,550.

According to Nick Twork, Lucid’s Head of Global Communications, the listings weren’t linked to demand but reflected efforts to assemble small batches around parts availability and align them with existing orders.

Production Ramp-up

The EV maker is targeting production of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles in 2025, a target that was revised to include a lower-end in August.

Considering that Lucid produced 9,966 vehicles between January 1 and September 30, it must produce between 8,034 and 10,034 vehicles in the final three months of the year to stay within the guidance.

Production is ramping up, with a second shift having recently started operating in its Arizona plant, as exclusively reported by EV.

The company will disclose its third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday (November 4), after market close.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

Happy Eco News reported that the team still has some work to do to boost efficiency in low-lit settings, but the progress is promising.","Solar experts in Taiwan are dabbling in cell molecular structure as they perfect devices that can harness energy from indoor light.

Happy Eco News reported that a team from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University has developed a cell that can convert more than 36% of LED light into energy. It's a fascinating breakthrough that could help to power electronics, sensors, and health monitors — negating the need for batteries in certain scenarios.

""The implications of this development go far beyond convenience. These solar panels can help reduce electronic waste by replacing batteries in millions of devices that would otherwise require frequent replacement or recharging,"" Happy Eco News' Cyrene Oraya Reyes wrote.

The team is working with perovskite, a promising material that can turn light into electricity with astounding efficiencies when incorporated into panels. But short lifespans have been a significant hurdle. Solar Magazine reported that perovskite panels can last a couple of years, compared to 30-plus years for common silicon panels.

The cells needed some molecular tuning, particularly in the bonding agents, to achieve suitable charge transport in the wide-bandgap units. Additives also bind with unwanted ions, helping with longevity issues, per Happy Eco News.

It's a ""promising passivation strategy for the development of high-performance"" indoor light catchers, the experts wrote in the study.

It's an interesting take on renewable energy, often characterized by large wind turbines and massive solar farms. But experts are working on devices that can make energy from low wind speeds and dim or indoor light. University College London is also working on cells that capture artificial illumination.

It's all helping to limit demand for electricity from dirty power sources that produce heat-trapping air pollution, linked by the American Lung Association to respiratory and other health risks.

All of our devices suck up loads of electricity. In fact, unplugging energy vampires, such as unused chargers, can save you $165 a year. Reducing the number of gadgets that need to be plugged in to begin with can solve much of the problem.

It's important because energy prices have been rising faster than inflation, according to NPR. Goldman Sachs expects the growth of data centers to suck up 165% more electricity by 2030, straining the grid.

Household solar is one of the best protections against uncontrollable rate hikes. The free solar energy can be stored in batteries, offering blackout protection, or sold back to the grid for a profit when part of a virtual power plant. EnergySage can help you compare quotes, find a timely installer, and lock in federal tax breaks before they expire. The resource can save you up to $10,000 on upfront costs.

In Taiwan, replacing batteries with light-based energy can also help limit environmental risks. When improperly disposed of, lithium-ion batteries are a toxic hazard, according to the University of Texas, Dallas.

To date, BMW cooperates with more than 300 partners, including Samsung SDI and Solid Power.","Since 2022, the BMW Group and Solid Power have been collaborating to expedite the development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology as part of a technology transfer agreement.

The pair has, as of this month, become a trio, with Samsung SDI joining to help with the validation and development of the ASSB tech in the automotive sector.

To date, the latest milestone is the integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle.

A solid state journey

Under the new agreement, Solid Power is set to supply sulphide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI.

After receiving the electrolytes, Samsung SDI aims to integrate these into the separator and/or the catholyte and use this to build cells – each case is subject to achievement of technical requirements.

Once the cells have been created, they will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW.

“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” says John Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power.

“Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity and by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

The overall aim is to integrate ASSB cells into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.

Partnering for ASSB tech

The collaboration is changing the game of the automotive sector, especially since “the partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials”, according to BMW in its press release.

As energy density increases, so can longer vehicle range, with the possibility of disregarding potential disadvantages when it comes to storage system weight.

""Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles,"" says Stella Joo-Young Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialisation Team at Samsung SDI.

""Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercialising ASSB.""

Partnering for a decade

BMW and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 via an extended “Joint Development Agreement”, supporting BMW’s investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of its financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership, allowing BMW to operate a solid-state cell prototype line at CMCC in Parsdorf – on the basis of a research and development licence and with Solid Power’s experience and expertise.

Since 2008, BMW has been building up competence in the battery cell technology field and since 2019, this has been pooled at BMW’s Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich.

To date, BMW cooperates with more than 300 partners, including Samsung SDI and Solid Power.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt.
“SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.
Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials.
“SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted.","As the global energy transition accelerates, Africa, especially Nigeria, stands at a pivotal crossroads. The continent, long known for its wealth of natural resources, now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to convert that endowment into economic power, by building local industries for renewable energy and clean technologies.

A new report by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), “Fostering Industrial Hubs for Energy Transition Technologies in Africa”, highlights how Africa can harness this global shift to achieve inclusive industrialisation, job creation, and sustainable growth.

Drawing on lessons from G20 nations, the report outlined a roadmap for building energy-transition industrial hubs that can transform the continent’s economic landscape.

For Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, the report signals both urgency and opportunity. With deliberate policy action, the country can transform from an importer of energy technologies into a regional producer, capturing value, creating jobs, and positioning itself at the heart of Africa’s clean energy future.

“Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand”

The SEforALL report situates Africa’s green industrialisation within a global context of shifting trade and technology. It noted that in 2024, G20 countries traded over $420 billion worth of solar modules, batteries, and electric vehicles, representing nearly 75 percent of global trade in these technologies.

However, the report warned that supply chains for these technologies remain highly concentrated. Over 90 percent of G20 imports of cobalt ores and concentrates came from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023, while 61 percent of graphite was sourced from China and 82 percent of lithium from Australia.

“The message is increasingly loud and clear,” the report stated. “Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand, requiring stronger collaboration to ensure that supply chains are diversified and benefits more equitably distributed.”

For Africa, this linkage between energy transition and industrialisation is both a challenge and an opening. As global powers seek to secure raw materials and manufacturing capacity, the continent can move beyond the “pit-to-port paradigm” of extraction to build industries that add value locally.

A $27 Billion Market Opportunity

According to SEforALL, Africa’s renewable energy ambitions already point to an emerging market of significant scale. “For Sub-Saharan Africa, total renewables capacity in the power sector is expected to triple to 165 GW by 2030, with nearly 40 GW of solar PV,” the report says.

This expansion represents “a $27 billion market opportunity in the solar PV sector alone between 2025 and 2030, including modules and balance of system components.” Demand for lithium-based batteries is also forecast to reach 10 GWh by 2030, generating a market opportunity of $10–15 billion annually.

The report observes that Africa imported more than $12 billion in finished energy-transition products between 2022 and 2024 — with South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya among the largest importers. “If current trends continue and domestic manufacturing capacities remain underdeveloped, import costs will escalate,” it warned.

SEforALL argued that this rising demand, coupled with strong resource endowments, creates a foundation for local manufacturing. “Strategically investing in tailored localisation strategies for energy-transition technologies is not only a socioeconomic opportunity, it is also a future-proofing strategy,” it concluded.

Building hubs for green manufacturing

The report called for the creation of industrialisation hubs for energy-transition technologies, combining national action with regional and international collaboration. It identifies three key domains of focus: industrial policy, infrastructure, and partnerships.

“Advancing industrialisation hubs in Africa for energy-transition technologies requires a coordinated, whole-of-government strategy,” it said. Such an approach should align ministries of trade, investment, mining, energy, and skills development around a shared industrial mission.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt. “SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.

Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials. “SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted. By 2030, the plan targets an addition of 5 GW per year of renewable capacity and over 25,000 jobs.

For Nigeria, a similar roadmap could be developed under its Energy Transition Plan to link domestic renewable targets with local production of solar modules, inverters, and battery storage systems.

“The manufacturing sector is critical for employment generation”

SEforALL underscores that industrialisation is key to inclusive development. “The manufacturing sector is particularly critical for employment generation, as well as economic transformation,” it says. Yet manufacturing value added in Sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated at about 11 percent of GDP for two decades.

By 2030, “half of all new entrants into the global labour force will come from Sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually,” the report observes. Green manufacturing could absorb much of this workforce.

The employment potential of renewable manufacturing is especially strong in solar energy. SEforALL estimates nearly 4 million person-years of labour in solar PV manufacturing between 2024 and 2050 — equivalent to 146,000 full-time jobs annually.

It concluded: “Renewables manufacturing can support job creation objectives with over 146,000 jobs annually in solar PV assembly alone.”

Trade integration and value chain development

The SEforALL report highlights trade policy as a cornerstone of Africa’s green industrialisation. “Clean energy supply chains are deeply trade-dependent,” it notes. Strategic trade measures — including calibrated tariffs, regional trade integration, and investment incentives — can unlock domestic manufacturing potential.

The report calls for deeper implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to build regional value chains. “Africa needs both regional and intercontinental trade agreements to build market linkages for intermediate and finished goods,” it stressed.

Intra-African merchandise trade currently accounts for just 13.7 percent of total trade, compared to 22 percent in ASEAN and 58 percent in the European Union. According to SEforALL, “Every 10 percent increase in regional trade in intermediary products correlates with a nearly 4 percent increase in manufacturing employment.”

The report also underscores the need to reconcile global trade rules with the industrialisation goals of developing countries. “There is an urgent need to promote dialogue on reconciling international trade regulations with climate action, particularly in the context of industrialisation goals of developing countries,” it said.

Technology and research gaps

Access to clean technology and innovation capacity remains one of Africa’s biggest obstacles. SEforALL points out that G20 countries owned about 91 percent of all patents in environmental technologies filed between 2000 and 2021, with China, Japan, the United States, Korea, and Germany accounting for the bulk.

“The development of industrialisation hubs for minerals beneficiation and clean energy manufacturing requires access to technology, skilled labour, and innovation ecosystems,” the report stated.

It urges stronger North–South and South–South collaboration to bridge this technology gap. “The G20 could serve as a key forum to facilitate partnerships and engagement to address key barriers and strengthen technology access and local innovation systems in developing countries,” it added.

Skills and workforce development

The report emphasises that building green industries also requires human capital. “For the energy transition to contribute to employment in Africa, the workforce needs to be trained with adequate technical and non-technical skills and be ready to take the occupations that will be required,” it said.

It calls for targeted interventions in curriculum updates, industry–academia partnerships, and regional skills certification frameworks. “Governments play a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment for skills development,” SEforALL noted, adding that public funding for vocational training and workforce inclusion will be crucial.

A call to action

The SEforALL report concludes with a clear appeal: Africa must act now to align industrial policy, investment, and regional cooperation if it is to capture the economic gains of the clean energy transition.

“The opportunity for African countries to build domestic value chains for energy-transition technologies depends on several factors, including resource endowment, existing production capacities, soft and hard infrastructure, and an enabling policy and regulatory environment,” it stated.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2021/11/Energy-transition-1.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:37.866139

The site was originally home to a chemical processing plant owned by US company W. R. Grace, which produced commodities including sealants for rubber containers, latex products and resins, from 1954. However, in 1973, local residents complained about local air pollution around the plant, and testing from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1978 found that two local wells had been polluted, which the EPA attributed to the dumping of “effluent wastes” in lagoons in the area.

The EPA closed chemical processing at the site, and placed the area on the National Priorities List in 1983.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to try to get at least 15 to align their nationally determined emissions targets to have a stronger negotiating position during the Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 in Belem.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,” Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

A draft proposal for an agreement on climate commitments seen by The Associated Press calls for loosening core climate regulations by giving priority to economic and energy security.

Climate ministers will discuss the proposal, which would allow nations to swap emissions between domestic economic sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. It also calls for larger allowances for EU nations to buy carbon credits outside the bloc.

The EU’s long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia’s war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, upset environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her Green Deal, a plan aimed at making Europe the world’s first carbon-neutral continent.

But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovereignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU’s commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies.

Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to try to get at least 15 to align their nationally determined emissions targets to have a stronger negotiating position during the Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 in Belem.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,” Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

A draft proposal for an agreement on climate commitments seen by The Associated Press calls for loosening core climate regulations by giving priority to economic and energy security.

Climate ministers will discuss the proposal, which would allow nations to swap emissions between domestic economic sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. It also calls for larger allowances for EU nations to buy carbon credits outside the bloc.

The EU’s long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia’s war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, upset environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her Green Deal, a plan aimed at making Europe the world’s first carbon-neutral continent.

But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovereignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU’s commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies.

Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

“Today is about the level of ambition, and it’s about standing ground and not only sticking to talking the talk when it is easy, but also walking the walk when it becomes difficult,” Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari said in Brussels.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/5bbf7d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7281x4096+0+379/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F9f%2Fae%2F488a19c951cc92504432e04282f4%2F310bc3055da9422586933cad01e23576,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:39.005578

A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County, North Carolina.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry a?airs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/adobestock-crypto-mining-44446865-scaled-1-1024x6761762254328.jpg?h=a7e7c04b&itok=ePSiQQbD,N,,2025-11-04 07:05:00.144867

Quarter-over-quarter, the deficit worsened due to a continued fall in sales, as US tax credit incentives for EV purchases ended in September.

Samsung SDI is putting energy storage system (ESS) sales at the heart of its turnaround strategy, particularly in the US. That said, in European Union (EU) markets, the company still intends to capitalise on an expected peak in demand for EVs towards the end of the year. Indeed, the company signed more than 110GWh of supply contracts with automotive manufacturers during the quarter.

South Korean battery makers chase FEOC advantage

US battery storage projects still qualify for investment tax credit (ITC) incentives. However, new provisions introduced with the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) budget reconciliation legislation mean developers receiving material assistance above a certain threshold from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) companies will be unable to avail of the capex subsidies.

FEOC restrictions will apply to Chinese, Iranian, Russian and North Korean entities, and of course, in the battery space, that effectively means China, given the industry’s heavy dependence on the East Asian powerhouse for everything from materials processing to finished products.

Rules introduced under the Biden Administration already awarded a domestic content bonus for ITC-eligible projects, and ultimately, the US government wants to see the market served overwhelmingly by products made domestically.

Samsung SDI’s fellow South Korean rival LG Energy Solution (LG ES) has announced an uplift in ESS battery sales that helped keep the company’s most recent quarter profitable, even as EV battery sales slumped for LG ES, too.

South Korean companies, which had already invested in EV battery lines in the US, now hold the cards with a first-mover advantage to supply the energy storage market by retooling those EV battery factories.

The difference between them is that LG ES has already got ESS battery cell production lines up and running in the US, at its factory in Holland, Michigan. These lithium iron phosphate (LFP) production lines were repurposed from producing nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells for electric vehicles.

LG ES aims to have 17GWh of annual production capacity across four lines in Michigan by the end of this year and 30GWh within the US by the end of next year, meaning that from a relative standing start, Samsung SDI plans to achieve a similar level of production much faster. SK On is pursuing a similar strategy of investing in US production of LFP cells.

Tesla deal reports, NCA cell production already underway

In September, at this year’s RE+, the biggest clean energy industry event in the US, Samsung SDI debuted two battery energy storage system (BESS) products it will make within the country, Samsung Battery Box 1.7 (SBB 1.7) and SBB 2.0.

Both are 20-foot containerised BESS solutions, but SBB 1.7 is a 6.14MWh high energy density system utilising nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) battery cells and SBB 2.0 uses LFP cells. Although Samsung SDI did not offer a capacity for SBB 2.0 in launch materials, some sources speculated that it would hold a similar capacity to SBB 1.7.

SBB 1.7 will come onto the market sooner than its LFP counterpart. The company said in its results release that local production of NCA batteries already began last month at a factory in Indiana, through StarPlus Energy, a joint venture (JV) with auto OEM Stellantis.

Mass production of LFP batteries will begin this quarter. Samsung SDI highlighted its position in the market as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic LFP cells, which would mean its cells could be a simpler drop-in solution for system integrators used to working with Chinese suppliers.

Earnings improvement is expected in the fourth quarter, according to Samsung SDI, driven by growth in EV demand in Europe and ESS demand in the US.

This morning, newspaper The Korea Herald and news agency Reuters both reported that the company is in talks over a multi-year, multi-gigawatt-hour stationary energy storage battery supply deal with Tesla.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7076.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 06:19:41.673920

New Delhi: Brookfield Asset Management is planning to invest $12 billion in Andhra Pradesh's renewable energy sector over the next three years, said people with knowledge of the matter, in what would be the largest overseas commitment in that sector for India.

The purse could grow as the global investment firm is looking to establish a township, as well as multiple hotels under its Leela brand, they said.

Brookfield, which is eyeing investments across the value chain in the green energy sector, is likely to invest in Indosol's integrated manufacturing facility and Navayuga's renewable energy portfolio, besides manufacturing and green hydrogen projects.

The commitment was made at a meeting of Andhra Pradesh IT and electronics minister Nara Lokesh and Brookfield asset management managing partners Nawal Saini, Ankur Gupta and Arpit Agrawal.

Live Events

Investments in realty, hospitality too

It follows a September meeting between Lokesh and Brookfield global president Connor Teskey in London.

Andhra Pradesh has received major investments in the renewable energy sector by the likes of Premier Energies and Renew Power. Apart from renewable energy, Brookfield is planning to invest in other sectors in the state. The investment in the satellite township, planned to be set up north of Vizag, has not been worked out yet, said the people cited.

“The number of Leela hotels has not been finalised,” said one of them. “But in the meeting, the broad contours of this have been agreed upon.”

The investments in the real estate and hospitality sector will be over and above the $12 billion pledged for clean energy. Brookfield aims to expand its India portfolio from $30 billion to $100 billion in various sectors by 2030. The Andhra government is likely to ink a deal with Brookfield at its partnership summit on November 14-15 in Vizag.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term.","In President Donald Trump’s first term, the federal courts helped put the brakes on his administration’s retreat on environmental protection.

Nine months into the second Trump term, the courts appear divided on whether to allow the administration’s far more aggressive dismantling of policy on climate change, clean energy and environmental justice.

In the 14 environmental policy cases so far in which there have been rulings on legal issues, the outcomes appear to be roughly even, with six clear wins for the Trump administration, five for the challengers and three mixed decisions, according to an Inside Climate News analysis. But in the Trump administration’s six victories, there’s an ominous sign: Three came when U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal overturned lower court rulings. That means that as of Nov. 4, all of the appeals court decisions in environmental cases have gone the president’s way.

The most important appellate panel—the Supreme Court—has yet to weigh in on any environmental cases from Trump’s second term. But emergency orders the high court has issued on other issues—education and health, for example—portend trouble for the many lawsuits over the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of environmental justice grants.

The case outcomes are a sign that the environmental law battles of Trump’s second term will be different from those of his first term. They are playing out in federal courts that he has shaped with 251 appointments (his nominees hold 28 percent of 870 judgeships on courts established under Article III of the Constitution). And in the years Trump was out of office, his judicial appointees helped transform the laws governing federal regulation, giving agency decision-makers less deference and narrowing the scope of their authority. The changes have emboldened Trump’s second-term team leaders, like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, to push the envelope, including with a bid to rescind his agency’s authority to address climate change.

But all of the second-term court rulings so far have been on preliminary issues—mainly whether to put a hold on Trump administration actions while core case issues, such as constitutionality, are decided. Moreover, in the vast majority of environmental cases involving the Trump administration—24 out of 38—there have been no substantive rulings so far.

“It’s far too early to tell how they’ll go,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “The three where the courts have denied preliminary injunctions have gotten attention, but it’s only three” out of a much larger number of cases, he said. Gerrard compiled a list of environmental cases for Inside Climate News, based in part on the Sabin Center’s Climate Litigation Tracker.

Even if the second Trump administration is a more challenging legal environment, environmental advocates and Democratic state attorneys general are pushing forward with litigation, arguing that Zeldin and other Trump policymakers have overplayed their legal hand. And they maintain there’s reason to believe the courts ultimately will curb Trump rollbacks, especially on important regulatory issues, like the proposed repeal of the EPA’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gas emissions, that are yet to be finalized and litigated.

A Changed Legal Landscape

Records show challengers were successful in holding back many of the first Trump administration’s gambits to roll back environmental protection. One advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, says it sued the first Trump administration 163 times, winning nearly 90 percent of its cases. NRDC’s suits helped put a stop to the first Trump administration’s effort to restart the Keystone XL pipeline, to open areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic oceans to drilling and to eliminate energy efficiency standards.

The litigation tracker of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, which zeroed in on regulatory disputes, showed that 76 percent of 135 court cases over agency environment, energy and natural resources rules were decided against the Trump administration between 2017 and 2021. Courts in those cases, for example, determined that the Trump EPA failed to follow the law in its weakening of rules on the potent greenhouse gases known as HFCs, on its handling of toxic wastewater discharges from power plants and in its delay of rules on methane emissions from landfills.

The current array of environmental policy cases is quite different from the mix in Trump’s first term, reflecting how much policy he has sought to make through executive action, without resorting to the formal regulatory and deregulatory process. For example, there are four challenges related to Trump’s executive orders to halt offshore wind energy development before the courts—and in one of those cases, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island succeeded in getting an injunction lifting Trump’s stop-work order and allowing it to resume construction.

Trump’s assertion of executive authority on renewables decision-making cuts both ways; the administration has been sued by two anti-wind-energy groups over its decision to allow another offshore project, Empire Wind, to proceed. A U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled on Oct. 23 in favor of the Trump administration, which is a win for Empire Wind.

A district judge in Washington state has blocked, for now, the Trump plan to suspend the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure charging network, known as NEVI. And a district judge in New York ruled that New York City’s new congestion pricing program should be allowed to go into effect while litigation over whether Trump has power to stop it proceeds.

Although the cases are varied, observers see common threads in the executive actions at issue.

“The theme that runs throughout is they’re doing everything they can to maximize both the supply of and the demand for fossil fuels,” Gerrard said.

In four cases, the Trump administration is directly challenging states’ authority to pursue their own climate policy. The Justice Department is seeking to overturn the climate “superfund” laws of Vermont and New York, and to block Michigan and Hawaii from suing fossil fuel companies to recover climate change costs, such as the expense of infrastructure to address sea level rise and to protect populations from extreme heat events. There have been no rulings in those cases so far.

One case that embodies the division among federal judges ruling on Trump environmental policy is the challenge to his siting of a migrant detention camp in the Everglades. The property known as “Alligator Alcatraz” is in the midst of wetlands that filter and store water for millions of Floridians, land that is sacred to Florida’s Miccosukee Tribe. A federal judge on Aug. 22, acting on a request by the tribe and environmentalists, ordered that the facility be dismantled and wound down. But in a 2-1 decision on Sept. 4, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily lifted that order, while the courts decide if an adequate environmental review was conducted. The two judges who sided with the Trump administration were among the six Trump appointees on the 12-judge 11th Circuit, which hears appeals throughout the Southeast.

The federal judicial system was designed to insulate judges from politics, requiring that appointees be confirmed by the Senate and be given lifetime appointments. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has vociferously defended the judiciary’s independence, declaring in 2018, “There are no Obama judges or Trump judges,” but “an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”

Nevertheless, legal scholars have documented the partisan shift in judicial philosophy on the Supreme Court, with its conservative majority bolstered by three Trump appointees. And litigants are increasingly choosing where they file challenges against the federal government based on the political leanings they perceive in the Circuit Courts of Appeal, according to data compiled by the Institute for Policy Integrity.

The 177 active U.S. Courts of Appeal judges are closely divided in terms of appointees of Republican (51 percent) and Democratic (49 percent) presidents overall. But there are stark regional differences, with Republican presidential appointees holding 91 percent of the seats on the 8th Circuit in the Mountain West, and Democratic appointees holding 100 percent of the judgeships in the 1st Circuit in New England.

In the federal trial courts, (known as district courts), usually the first step in the legal process, Democratic appointees hold 61 percent of the 626 active judgeships, compared to Republicans’ 39 percent. And some decisions by Republican-appointed district judges have gone against the Trump administration. For example, Revolution Wind won its injunction from U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.

And U.S. District Judge William Young in Massachusetts, another Reagan appointee, issued an order in June blocking the Trump administration’s cancellation of 2,100 National Institutes of Health grants. The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court and got an emergency order to reverse Young’s decision. Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is arguing, and a number of judges are agreeing, that the district courts have no jurisdiction over challenges to his administration’s termination of billions of dollars of grants, mostly for disadvantaged communities.

A Grenade From the Shadow Docket

At least nine lawsuits are underway over the Trump administration’s termination of the green bank and environmental justice and clean energy grants that Congress authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The grant cancellations are erasing one of President Joe Biden’s most important climate initiatives.

Grantees scored early wins, with federal judges in Maryland, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. ordering funds released while the legal challenges are heard. “EPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress and refuse to comply with its directives,” wrote U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson, a Biden appointee, in deciding the Maryland case. The cases raise serious constitutional issues as well as statutory ones—in the South Carolina case, for example, the issue of whether grantees had been illegally targeted because of their viewpoints in violation of the First Amendment.

But since June, environmental grantees have seen a slew of defeats. The shift came after a divided Supreme Court issued two emergency orders favoring the Trump administration in its cancellation of education and NIH grants. A 5-4 majority of the high court backed the Trump administration’s view that such lawsuits were simple breach-of-contract matters that should be decided in a specialized venue, the Court of Federal Claims.

The rulings were consequential. The Claims Court only has the power to award money to grantees, not to reinstate terminated programs or decide on the big legal issues that the grantees have raised. For example, it has no authority to rule on charges that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally or violated laws such as the Administrative Procedures Act, which is meant to protect citizens from “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. Ten of the 16 active judges on the Claims Court were appointed by Trump.

And because the Supreme Court took these cases from its emergency docket—its “shadow” docket, as critics call it—the big legal issues were barely aired. “Barebones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,” said Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent in the education grants case, chiding the majority from making new law from the emergency docket, as the court has done increasingly in recent years. Another dissenter, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, called the majority’s ruling on the education grant terminations “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate,” and in the NIH case, she lamented that “a half paragraph of reasoning” was justifying cutting off millions of dollars for life-saving biomedical research, and had the potential to derail other grantees raising similar claims.

The Court, she said, “lobs this grenade without evaluating Congress’s intent or the profound legal and practical consequences” and is “sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.”

In three environmental grants cases so far—two in the appeals courts and one in the Washington, D.C. district court—judges have followed the Supreme Court majority’s reasoning, saying the cases likely belong in the Claims Court. The rulings have stymied efforts to save one of Biden’s largest climate programs, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This so-called “green bank” was designed to act as a revolving fund, providing low-interest loans to give disadvantaged communities access to financing for renewable energy and efficiency upgrades. Initially seeking to claw back $20 billion of the fund, the EPA’s Zeldin leveled allegations of corruption against the recipients and the Biden administration. A lower court judge said the EPA had not offered any evidence of wrongdoing, and ruled that the funds should be released, before she was overturned by a 2-1 vote of a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The two judges who sided with Zeldin were Trump appointees.

Now, some grantees are trying to be proactive in anticipation that judges will move their complaints to the Claims Court. On Oct. 15, a coalition of states launched a two-pronged legal attack against Zeldin’s August cancellation of the remaining portion of the green bank fund, the $7 billion Solar for All program, by filing lawsuits simultaneously in the district court and the Claims Court. The move puts a large environmental grant program in line to be the first adjudicated in the Claims Court. The Solar for All case could become an early indicator of what kind of money damages, interest and attorneys fees the United States Treasury may be forced to pay because of the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of grant programs.

For now, most climate and environmental justice grant recipients have been denied access to their funds. But the grantees believe the Supreme Court has offered a narrow window of opportunity to have their legal issues heard. Roberts sided with the liberal justices in ruling that challenges to the grants’ terminations should not be funneled to the Claims Court. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett provided a crucial swing vote in the NIH grant ruling; joined by Roberts and the three liberal justices, Barrett said the plaintiffs could still challenge the Trump administration’s internal agency guidance determining which grants were cancelled.

Jackson expressed doubt as to whether Barrett’s compromise provided any meaningful opportunity for the grantees to have their claims heard: “It splits review of the grant terminations from review of the grant termination policy—thereby preserving the mirage of judicial review while eliminating its purpose: to remedy harms,” Jackson wrote in her dissent.

Nevertheless, arguments were heard in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 seeking to revive the South Carolina case and its claims that the Trump administration had acted unconstitutionally.

Counting on Judicial Independence

To affirm the value of pushing back against Trump in the courts, some environmental advocates can point to wins they obtained just by filing lawsuits that brought to light the impact of Trump administration actions. After the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York filed suit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May restored climate-smart agriculture information it had purged from its website. (Among the pages that were missing for a time were those that helped farmers access billions of dollars in support for conservation practices.)

And after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Energy disbanded a committee of five well-known climate science deniers it had assembled to produce a controversial review of climate science. EDF argued that the creation of such a secret committee was a clear violation of the transparency and fairness mandates in the 53-year-old Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Trump administration has argued that the case is moot now that the committee is disbanded, but EDF is continuing the litigation.

“If the administration had followed federal law, full records of the deliberations and meetings of the climate working group would have been made available,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the EDF. “We believe that the American people are entitled to those records, and we are going to continue to press for them.”

Asked if she was concerned about whether the federal courts, with so many Trump appointees, would serve as an effective check on Trump in his second term, Patton expressed confidence in the system. “Our experience has been that there are courts and judges that are stewards of the rule of law and operate with the highest degree of integrity,” she said. “And I think everyone should ask that of our judiciary and our judicial system. It’s vital for our constitutional democracy.”

The most important challenges to Trump’s environmental rollbacks will come when federal agencies finalize their deregulatory proposals, including EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s pledge to wipe 31 pollution rules from the books.

A key case to watch will be the inevitable legal challenge to Zeldin’s planned repeal of the EPA’s 16-year-old finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, the foundation on which all of the EPA’s other climate rules are based. Zeldin’s proposal leans heavily on a series of decisions that the Supreme Court has delivered in the past three years that limit an agency’s authority to act without explicit direction from Congress, especially in matters of great economic significance: the court’s so-called “major questions doctrine.”

“We can no longer rely on statutory silence or ambiguity to expand our regulatory power,” the EPA said in its proposal.

Climate action advocates will argue it was the Supreme Court itself that ruled in its landmark 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA case that greenhouse gases fit the definition of “pollutant” under the Clean Air Act, and directed the EPA to lay out its reasoning for or against regulation grounded in the language of that law. In the wake of that ruling, the Supreme Court rejected bids to overturn the endangerment finding, and ruled to limit state actions on climate change specifically because the EPA has the governing authority over climate regulation. But the five justices who decided the case for Massachusetts are dead or retired. Three of the dissenters, Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, remain on the court, along with three Trump appointees who have voted for limited EPA power on climate change.

Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court were to now agree with the Trump administration’s view that the EPA never had the authority to act on climate under the Clean Air Act, it could unravel all of the case law on the subject since the Massachusetts decision.

“They’re betting that they can get the current six-member majority to say, ‘We don’t care about Massachusetts, and frankly, we don’t care about the three other climate decisions we made that built on and accepted Massachusetts,’” said David Doniger, senior attorney and climate and energy strategist for NRDC. “They’re betting the court is just going to bless the Trump administration doing whatever it wants and I don’t think that kind of lawlessness is going to prevail.”

The EPA has received more than 568,000 public comments on its endangerment finding repeal proposal, and the law is clear that the agency must provide a “reasoned response” to any substantive comments. In fact, the Supreme Court last year blocked the Biden administration cross-state air pollution rule from taking effect, ruling that his EPA had failed to adequately address public comments.

All eyes will be on whether the Supreme Court holds the Trump EPA to the same standard.

“I count on the independence of the courts,” Doniger said. “We’re all counting on that for so much.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205531023-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:52.595409

In a filing Monday, the utility company outlined how the proposed data center — backed by a real estate development company tied to billionaire megadonor Stephen Ross' Related Companies and tech companies Oracle and ChatGPT maker OpenAI — would reduce costs despite using as much energy as is needed to power more than 1 million average American homes.

Exactly how much households could save is unclear, in part, because DTE cannot lower utility rates without going through the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state's energy regulator.

Michigan Public Service commissioners, who will decide whether the project moves forward, are focused on ensuring the plan protects DTE ratepayers if the data center developer doesn’t follow through on its plans for using power.

“I think the commission’s focus here is really ensuring that customers, existing customers, aren’t ultimately left paying for or subsidizing this (data center) customer,” MPSC Chair Dan Scripps said.

DTE has been insistent that power rates will not go up because of the data center. That's partly because of a Michigan law prohibiting residential users from shouldering the costs of data centers and partly because the sprawling facility planned for Saline Township will pay for a higher chunk of DTE's overall fixed costs.

The deal between DTE and the joint-venture data center calls for regulator approval by Dec. 5, although when the commission takes up the case is beyond the control of DTE and the company. Scripps said the commission will not take the case up this week.

“We need to carefully review the proposal and make sure the modeling is correct, the cost assumptions are correct, that the actual pledges the customer is going to be responsible for … are well documented,” Scripps said. “We have a fair amount of work ahead of us.”

It's also up to the commission to decide whether the deal is approved without public hearings. Commissioners are allowed to rule on such cases without a notice or public hearings if there are no added costs to consumers, but the commission can open the case for broader feedback at its discretion.

The project has been met with pushback since its inception. Related Digital previously sued Saline Township over officials' initial decision to oppose its rezoning, but the town board eventually allowed the project to move forward in lieu of a court battle.

Environmental groups are still figuring out how they will respond to DTE’s proposal, said Bryan Smigielski, Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Michigan campaign organizer. The groups intervened in Consumers Energy’s request to build a framework for contracts it drafts with data centers and have advocated for renewable energy and ratepayer protections.

“Anything that could have a big impact on our energy system should be a contested case,” he said. “If it’s going to impact health or climate targets or people’s bills, I would expect that.”

Climate impact

Environmental advocates have warned that building a new data center of this scale could pressure utilities to continue relying on fossil fuels to save money and meet energy needs.

Scripps said DTE proposed using batteries in what's called an energy storage system to store more power from its existing sources — such as renewables or baseload coal, natural gas or nuclear power — in order to serve the data center’s initial electricity needs. That could lead to the utility firing up fossil fuel-based power sources more often to charge the batteries.

""What are the batteries going to be charged from?"" said Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""If it's 1.4 gigawatts of energy storage — it's one thing if they're charged by the Monroe Coal Plant, and it's another thing if they're charged by solar. So we want to make sure that we're not prolonging the life of DTE's fossil fleet through the use of this storage resource.""

Legislation adopted in 2023 under the then-Democratic-led Michigan Legislature imposed a 100% clean energy standard for utilities by 2040. It also shifted power from local governments to the state to authorize large-scale wind and solar projects so the projects could move forward at a quicker pace.

In his testimony to the MPSC, DTE Director of Renewable Energy Planning and Strategy Kevin Bilyeu said the company’s renewable power target will increase by approximately 30.5% with the addition of the new data center.

The amount of power it would have to develop to serve the data center varies depending on the source of that renewable power and the number of renewable energy credits DTE puts toward the effort. To completely serve the data center with solar power, the utility would have to build 3.2 gigawatts of solar arrays, Bilyeu said. If the company used all of its expected renewable energy credits on this project, it would only have to build 443 megawatts of renewable power, he said in his testimony.

But Bilyeu said DTE’s renewable power strategy will allow it to meet renewable portfolio standards even with the addition of the data center.

""Bringing on new data center load of this magnitude actually creates affordability — and therefore headroom — to comply with the state’s clean energy targets,"" DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said in an email. ""DTE's contract with the data center will by itself lead to the near-term deployment of enough battery storage in Michigan to satisfy the requirements of the state’s energy storage mandate.""

DTE will evaluate its renewable energy development plan during its next integrated resource planning process, which starts next year.

Smigielski questioned DTE’s statements that the utility has excess capacity it could use to serve a hyperscale data center that demands 1.4 gigawatts of power. Utilities have to deal with variations in demand, so they need excess capacity in order to supply their customers on the hottest days of summer when energy demand peaks.

If DTE starts pumping out as much electricity as it possibly can every day, then it would have to build additional power to satisfy its customers on peak demand days, Smigielski said.

Smigielski also pointed to DTE executives’ previous statements that the company is in discussions with multiple large data center customers, all of whom would increase demand for electricity.

“There’s simply no way that can not require additional generation,” he said.

""Constellation already has invested over $1 billion of its own money on Maryland wind, hydro and 24/7 clean nuclear energy resources to power Maryland families and businesses for generations to come.
""What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power.
The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility.
Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.","BALTIMORE (Nov. 4, 2025) — Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) today announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland to meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth. The proposal offers Maryland leaders a menu of options so they can make informed decisions about how to power the state’s economy and address climate change in the most cost-effective way for generations to come.

To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) on October 31 as part of a state program to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. These projects would by themselves cover more than 5 percent of the state’s peak load with battery storage and increase total power generation capacity about 10 percent, representing billions of dollars of private-sector investment in Maryland energy infrastructure. Longer term, the company has proposed a range of new and existing nuclear investments, including a plan to work with state leaders to explore building new nuclear power plants in Maryland.

""Constellation already has invested over $1 billion of its own money on Maryland wind, hydro and 24/7 clean nuclear energy resources to power Maryland families and businesses for generations to come. Today, we announce an ambitious plan to make billions of dollars of new investments in Maryland without seeking any electricity rate increases, including options ranging from new natural gas to battery storage and nuclear energy,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation. ""Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices. For example, while there is a good deal of consensus on the need for battery storage, the future of natural gas in our state is less clear. Some Maryland stakeholders support new natural gas development, including the pipeline work that would be needed, while others oppose it even if that means building transmission lines and importing electricity from natural gas-rich states like Pennsylvania. We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.

""What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation. The historic agreement reached by Maryland and Constellation this September paves the way for extending the life of the Conowingo Dam for another 50 years, providing clean energy for hundreds of thousands of families for generations, while also investing $340 million to preserve wildlife and this beautiful watershed that we all enjoy. Likewise, Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.

""Finally, we are excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today. Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits. We are a company that competes for its opportunities just like all our hardworking customers do — every single day. We rely on the talent and ingenuity of our Maryland team of power generation experts to make prudent investments, understanding that we will bear 100% of the risks of any cost overruns, delays or bad decisions that sometimes plague utility investments. That is the way it should be because the privilege to serve our customers and earn profits should be won, not guaranteed. Maryland is our home state and Constellation looks forward to continuing to offer competitive and innovative solutions to our state to create a prosperous and brighter future for Maryland families and businesses.""

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including:

State-of-the-art battery storage: Constellation is offering up to 800 megawatts of battery storage capacity that can release electricity to the grid quickly during times of peak demand, maintaining a stable power supply on the hottest days and coldest nights.

Investments in natural gas-powered generation: More than 700 megawatts (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on carbon-free hydrogen fuel to reduce emissions. The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 megawatts of new and existing nuclear projects that, with customer support, could power the state’s economy with clean energy well into the next century, including:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

If fully realized, nearly 70 percent of the combined near- and long-term investments would be in clean, emissions-free energy resources and would increase the share of energy Maryland gets from clean resources from just over 50 percent today to about 70 percent once all the projects come online, supporting the state’s ambitious climate goals.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation is leading the way to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these ""demand response"" programs more impactful by using AI and American ingenuity to create a 1,000 megawatt ""virtual power plant"" on the regional grid — the equivalent of a new nuclear reactor.

Constellation could bring all — or any combination — of these new projects forward to meet Maryland’s energy generation needs at the lowest possible cost to consumers, provided we have clear direction and enabling legislation from Maryland’s policymakers. Local utilities also have a critical role to play by supporting faster connections to the grid and ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to deliver fuel to new gas-fired generation.

By adopting this approach, Maryland can preserve the benefits it has received over the past 20 years by being part of PJM, the grid operator serving Maryland, 12 other states and the District of Columbia. In PJM states, power generators like Constellation compete to provide the lowest cost generation resources across the region with no guarantee of earning a profit on their investments. As a result, the cost of power generation in PJM — the part of the bill that is not regulated by the state and is paid for with private investment – has remained flat for more than 15 years, even factoring in recent increases in generation capacity charges resulting from higher electricity demand. By contrast, studies have shown that utility spending on poles and wires — which earn a guaranteed rate of return that is charged to every business and household — is largely responsible for recent increases in utility bills across the country, including in Maryland.

With power demand projected to rise further in PJM states over the next five years, Constellation has proposed reforms that would make the competitive market work even more effectively for Maryland consumers. The company has joined with technology companies and other energy suppliers on policies that would speed investment in new generation and lower costs while minimizing risk to utility ratepayers. These policies would improve PJM’s method of forecasting electricity use, increase use of demand response programs that reduce energy use on the grid at times of peak demand, and help spur further investment in new power sources. You can find a complete list of those proposals here.

Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year.
Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership.
“By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.","Honeywell today announced a landmark agreement with Wabash Valley Resources, LLC (WVR) to integrate its industry-leading carbon capture technologies into a project that will revive and modernize an idled gasification facility in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The ambitious initiative aims to produce hydrogen and ammonia fertilizer with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, addressing national priorities for food security and energy dominance.

The project, one of the first in the U.S. to produce low-carbon intensity hydrogen and ammonia, received a substantial boost from the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), which secured a $1.559 billion loan for WVR. This funding was granted through a program focused on maximizing the utilization of domestic energy infrastructure in agricultural sectors.

Central to the West Terre Haute facility's low-carbon profile is the implementation of Honeywell’s carbon capture solution. This technology is engineered to capture and permanently store nearly 1.65 million tons of CO2 annually underground. This sequestration effort is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by over 1.65 million acres of U.S. forests in a year, marking a significant environmental achievement for the industrial sector.

Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year. This scaling of domestic production is expected to be a game-changer for American agriculture, aiming to replace half the imported supply for farmers across the critical Corn Belt, including in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. By reducing reliance on foreign imports, WVR hopes to exert downward pressure on fertilizer prices, directly benefiting farmers.

Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership. “As energy demand increases, Honeywell's carbon capture technologies help customers like Wabash Valley Resources optimize operations and reduce emissions to help boost the domestic production of important inputs like ammonia to support American agriculture,” West stated.

Dan Williams, CEO of Wabash Valley Resources, echoed this sentiment, stating the facility’s goals are to strengthen America's fertilizer supply chain and advance cleaner production methods. “By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.

The engineering and design of the facility are being handled by SAMSUNG E&A, a total solutions provider for the global energy industry. This collaboration leverages an existing joint endeavor between Honeywell and SAMSUNG E&A to market Honeywell’s advanced solvent carbon capture (ASCC) technology, demonstrating a shared commitment to global decarbonization efforts.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:59.641860

In last week’s announcement, the federal agency decided the state’s air quality improvement measures still fulfill the Clean Air Act, even without the home energy audits.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced last Wednesday that Alaska’s revised plan to improve air quality in the Fairbanks and North Pole is good to go.

The new — and final — state roadmap eliminates a Biden-era regulation that would’ve required people in the area to get an energy rating before selling their homes, and Alaska’s Department of Environmental Conservation is now in the process of repealing the requirement from the state’s administrative code. The regulation was set to take effect at the beginning of next year.

The EPA’s decision may mark the end of a yearslong policy tug-of-war – but only if the remaining methods to clean up the air succeed.

Energy audits removed

Scientists and state officials have repeatedly said smoke from wood stoves contributes the most to the Fairbanks area’s notoriously poor wintertime air quality. Energy audits aim to collect information on homes’ energy efficiency and heating systems, like wood stoves, then compile that data and give residences a rating.

But local realtors and elected officials argued that requiring them in the nonattainment area as part of the plan would’ve been a mistake. Heather Ferguson, a real estate agent and the legislative chair for the Greater Fairbanks Board of Realtors, said she’s glad federal and state officials are dropping the regulation.

“The energy rating itself is not doing anything to improve the air quality,” she said. “It was a data grab on … like the biggest thing a consumer can own.”

Ferguson also said paying for the mandated energy ratings would’ve burdened home sellers, and that the limited availability of energy raters would’ve created a bottleneck in the local housing market. According to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, there are currently four qualified energy raters in the Fairbanks North Star Borough.

“It was going to cripple our real estate market until we got more auditors,” Ferguson said.

Air quality plan gets final approval

The state’s federally-required plan to improve Fairbanks air quality has undergone multiple iterations and a fair amount of turbulence since 2009. That’s when the feds first determined that the amount of harmful particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, or PM2.5, was exceeding federal standards in Fairbanks and North Pole air.

In 2019, the nonattainment area was reclassified from “moderate” to “serious.” The finding forced the State of Alaska to develop a new blueprint for how to fix the problem, called the Serious Implementation Plan (SIP).

In 2023, as part of the problem’s more recent history, the EPA decided some portions of the SIP weren’t good enough. That triggered a penalty called a conformity freeze, which has since been limiting how local and state transportation officials can use federal funds for infrastructure projects in the nonattainment area.

The state DEC then spent more than a year seeking to address the EPA’s concerns, and in early January, soon before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the administration under then-President Joe Biden proposed approving a revised version of the state plan.

The next month, after the public comment period on that proposed approval had ended, both the Fairbanks City Council and Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly passed resolutions urging federal officials to reconsider the mandated energy audits, which had been introduced in the SIP as a “compromise” with the EPA following the 2023 disapproval. The EPA under Trump then reopened public comment on the plan this March, citing local pushback to the home energy rating regulation.

In last week’s announcement, the federal agency decided the state’s air quality improvement measures still fulfill the Clean Air Act, even without the home energy audits. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said “Alaskans shouldn’t have to sacrifice their way of life to protect human health and the environment,” and that the state’s plan “proves that both goals are achievable.”

But Patrice Lee, a Fairbanks resident and spokesperson for the group Citizens for Clean Air, thinks Zeldin is wrong.

“To sacrifice human health and the environment is a recipe for destroying lifestyle,” she said in a prepared statement. “Nothing puts a damper on lifestyle like not being able to breathe, or heart problems.”

In response to follow-up questions, Lee also said the plan doesn’t have enough teeth, and that repealing the audits just weakens it further.

“It’s voluntary whether or not you change out your wood stove. It’s voluntary now whether or not you tell a buyer what the status of the home heating system is that they’re potentially going to purchase,” she said. “Everything is voluntary.”

What’s next

Though the EPA has approved the plan, Fairbanks air quality still must get in line with federal standards by the end of 2027, and Lee said she’s not convinced that’ll happen.

According to state data, the monitoring site at Hurst Road in North Pole continues to register the worst air quality in the area. PM2.5 levels there dropped significantly between 2012 and 2018, but they’ve since stayed pretty stagnant, and the levels are still roughly double federal maximums for the pollutant.

In the approved plan, the state said that 2027 reflects reaching attainment “as expeditiously as practicable.” State Division of Air Quality Director Jason Olds said by email Monday that if the Fairbanks area still has too much PM2.5 in its air at that time, the EPA would make a “finding of failure,” and the state would have to amend the plan yet again.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/488eb64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F2e%2F737362824af4aa8fc4ca3c9fa536%2Fstovepipedb.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:21.456544

The company reached a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy (WDS) under which it will invest in the 16.5 Mtpa (2.5 Bcf/d) Louisiana LNG project. WMB will acquire a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG and has committed to a 1.5 Mtpa (~200 MMcf/d) offtake obligation.

Under the deal announced Oct. 22, Williams will also acquire an 80% ownership stake and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline. The company will assume responsibility for construction of Driftwood Line 200, a 3+ Bcf/d header line extending from Lake Charles to the Gillis hub. At Gillis, Driftwood Line 200 will connect with WMB’s Transcontinental and Louisiana Energy Gateway (LEG), as well as several other pipelines. In total, WMB expects to invest $1.9B under the agreement.

The deal with Williams gives Woodside much-needed counterparty backing for Louisiana LNG. WDS in late April announced a $17.5B project FID, despite having only one customer (a 1 Mtpa sales and purchase agreement with Uniper) at the time. WDS in April sold a 40% stake in the project to Stonepeak for $5.7B.

Along with the Woodside announcement, WMB and GEP Haynesville II reached an agreement with JERA to sell 100% of their respective interests in the South Mansfield upstream assets in DeSoto Parish, LA. The properties produce more than 500 MMcf/d currently, and the deal includes a plan to develop ~200 undeveloped locations to grow production to over 1 Bcf/d. JERA is one of the largest buyers of US LNG, with a total of 5.5 Mtpa contracted between five LNG projects (see table).

This is just the latest in a string of Haynesville land grabs by Japanese companies in an effort to ensure security of supply. Last year, Tokyo Gas bought Rockcliff Energy for $2.7B, and Mitsubishi reportedly was in talks to buy Aethon Energy Management earlier this year. Mitsui has been among the companies active in the exploratory Western Haynesville, alongside Comstock Resources (CRK) and Aethon. Expand Energy (EXE) also recently committed to the emerging play, acquiring 75,000+ net acres in the region for $178MM.

All of this buzz around the Haynesville is for good reason. East Daley Analytics’ current balanced forecast in the Macro Supply & Demand Report sees nearly 4 Bcf/d of ArkLaTex production growth in 2026. While this amount of growth is ambitious based on current producer guidance, we expect a step change in gas demand from new LNG facilities and data centers will put serious upward pressure on gas prices next year. Among leading gas basins, the Haynesville has demonstrated a unique ability to respond quickly to changing fundamentals. See our upcoming Dirty Little Secrets publication for in-depth analysis of the full range of possibilities next year and beyond. – Oren Pilant Tickers: CRK, EXE, WDS, WMB.

This shift has led to a sharp decline in sales across multiple automakers, potentially reshaping the landscape of the EV market in the short term.

Key Findings

Ford reported a 25% year-over-year decline in all-electric sales

Hyundai and Kia saw steep declines after record September sales

Toyota's BZ electric model sales dropped dramatically

Honda's Prologue SUV sales declined by 81%

Market Implications

The expiration of the federal tax credit has had a profound impact on EV sales across the board. Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested that the EV market share could fall to around 5% from the 10-12% recorded in September. This projection comes despite the US EV sales reaching a record 438,487 units in the third quarter, up 40.7% from the previous quarter.

Bright Spot: Hybrid Sales

While pure EV sales have taken a hit, there's a silver lining for some manufacturers. Hyundai, for instance, reported a 41% year-over-year increase in hybrid sales. This boost helped the company's total electrified sales increase by 8%, despite the 57% drop in pure EV sales.

Industry Outlook

Industry analysts described the decline as expected, given the expiration of the federal tax credit. The sudden drop in sales highlights the significant role government incentives play in driving EV adoption. As the market adjusts to this new reality, it remains to be seen how automakers will adapt their strategies to maintain growth in the EV sector.

The dramatic shift in EV sales underscores the volatility of the emerging electric vehicle market and the impact of policy changes on consumer behavior. As the industry navigates these challenges, the coming months will be crucial in determining the long-term trajectory of EV adoption in the United States.

Ana Toni, Brazil’s climate change chief and CEO of COP30, said meeting those goals would only be possible by engaging mayors.
“Now, it is an existential fight between the climate wreckers and climate defenders,” Khan said.

“Especially because the effects of extreme climate events are felt in cities,” she said.","SAO PAULO (AP) — Just days ahead of the U.N. climate conference to be held in Brazil, a group of 300 mayors gathered Monday in Rio de Janeiro to pledge coordinated climate action and address rising heat that is hurting many of their residents.

The summit was organized by C40, a network of mayors from big cities that has pushed to be included in decisions on how to combat global warming and adapt to its effects.

Selwyn Hart, the U.N. special adviser and assistant secretary-general for climate change, said at the opening that mayors are on the front lines of the climate crisis.

“In the midst of all the geopolitical tensions and divisions, it is truly amazing and inspirational to see what is happening in this room and on the ground in your cities,” Hart said, adding that local leaders are needed “more than ever” as the world enters the second decade of implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

Ana Toni, Brazil’s climate change chief and CEO of COP30, said meeting those goals would only be possible by engaging mayors. “It is you, mayors, who have to make very hard decisions in daily life, together with people,” Toni said.

Criticism of Trump and administration policies

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals seemed to loom large at the mayors’ summit.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said mayors have “long been climate doers, while too many nations and states have been the climate delayers or, indeed, climate deniers.” Now, he added, the challenge has moved beyond a battle against climate denial.

“Now, it is an existential fight between the climate wreckers and climate defenders,” Khan said. “Among the wreckers is the president of the United States of America, someone who stood up at the U.N. only a matter of weeks ago and called the climate crisis a scam.”

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego drew applause from the audience after saying she was bringing “good news from the United States” and asked fellow American city leaders to raise their hands.

“We have 50 cities from the U.S. that are here, all committed to ambitious climate action. So, while our national government goes backward, these cities go forward,” Gallego said.

Gallego addressed how extreme heat is affecting her city, which has repeatedly broken temperature records in recent years. “This year, we hit 118 degrees — nearly 48 Celsius — not once, but twice,” the mayor said.

She then introduced the city’s plan to plant trees and install shade structures, develop pilot cool-surface technology, and offer heat-relief training to first responders, such as paramedics handling heat emergencies.

Scientists say that 4 billion people, about half the world’s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.

The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross. Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, C40 co-chair and former mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, said that extreme heat stands now as the deadliest weather related disaster and contributed to an estimated 489,000 deaths each year.

“And the economic consequences are staggering. Global extreme heat is projected to cause $2.4 trillion dollars of loss productity by 2030, as it becomes too dangerous for working outdoors,” she said, mentioning businesses like construction and agriculture.

Cooling cities down

On Monday, the C40 mayors launched a global coalition to prepare cities for a hotter future through an effort called the Cool Cities Accelerator.

A coalition of 33 cities — including Austin, Texas; Boston, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Freetown, Sierra Leone, London, Nairobi, Kenya; Phoenix, Paris and Singapore — has pledged to collaborate, share best practices and report progress on emergency measures such as strengthening early warning systems and ensuring access to cooling projects.

Within five years, cities aim to improve building standards, expand urban tree cover and shade, and future-proof critical infrastructure.

The Accelerator has implementation support from ClimateWorks Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Z Zurich Foundation and Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Rockefeller Foundation is also contributing just under $1 million to help cities launch the effort.

Cities will report back every two years on progress toward protecting residents from heat, said Emilia Carrera, the foundation’s director of health. Key metrics will include the establishment of cooling centers, the design of cooler urban spaces and updated building codes.

“Mayors see these challenges very closely,” Carrera said. “They have a fresher perspective and an ability to respond more quickly.”

Hannah Machado, an urbanist and climate researcher in the City +2°C Program at the Center for Urban Studies at Insper Research Institute in Sao Paulo, said cities have a long way to go to adapt to the changing climate.

“Especially because the effects of extreme climate events are felt in cities,” she said.

Cities, however, have reduced emissions faster than national governments, according to the C40 group. The group’s cities said they have cut emissions five times faster than the global average.

“In this year of major geopolitical shifts, that’s an understatement, city leadership has become even more important,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former climate minister who also served at the U.N. as the chair of the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments.

Yosef Abramowitz is Nobel Prize-nominated entrepreneur and activist and serves on the board of the Jewish Solar Challenge.","According to an annual study of U.S. nonprofits, 47% of respondents said they do not have the adequate funds to execute their programs and services in 2025 and 50% are concerned about their current financial situation. Yet many organizations overlook one of the most effective ways to cut overhead — a solution that’s literally on the roof over their heads: switching to solar power.

Aside from salaries, the cost of energy to power lights, heating, cooling and refrigeration is the highest operational expense for many synagogues, JCC’s and other Jewish nonprofits. Every dollar spent on power is a dollar that could otherwise support services and expand programming. While the upfront cost of installing solar panels may seem daunting, it pays for itself over time by reducing energy bills year after year.

And there’s no better time than now to make the switch. The Inflation Reduction Act included unprecedented federal solar incentives for nonprofits, houses of worship and schools. While those tax credits sunset at the end of the year, you shouldn’t let that stop your nonprofit from embracing what is now the cheapest form of energy available.

Several years ago, before nonprofit solar incentives existed, Mitchell worked hard to get his Reform Jewish temple in Los Angeles to install solar panels. He was surprised to find the process so challenging, but the money folks at nonprofits tend to plan in five-year cycles and it often takes five to 10 years for the energy savings generated by solar panels to offset the upfront costs.

His solution was to create the Jewish Solar Challenge, which shortens the payback period by offering direct matching grants to Jewish nonprofits willing to install solar and implement other sustainability measures. The results have been transformative, benefiting both the environment and the bottom line of the nonprofits we’ve supported.

In the past three years, the Jewish Solar Challenge has helped synagogues, schools, Hillels and Jewish camps add $2 million worth of solar panels, preventing 1,272 metric tons of CO? emissions and saving grantees nearly $500,000 in annual electricity costs. And the impact has even gone global: The installation of solar panels on one Jewish community center in Tikvah, Uganda, provided the community’s first consistent source of power for Shabbat — which the community had previously conducted in the dark.

As part of the grant application process, organizations must explain how they will advance long-term sustainability goals within their communities. Installing solar becomes a catalyst for other environmental initiatives, sparking conversations about stewardship and inspiring individuals to consider how they can reduce their own carbon footprint.

Judaism teaches its adherents to be strong stewards of the Earth, so going solar is mission-aligned. Many nonprofit donors also want their grantees to adopt more sustainable practices, but there’s also a pragmatic financial reason for all Jewish nonprofits and their funders to opt for harnessing the power of the sun: Even without federal incentives, solar power is now the cheapest form of energy, with installation costs plummeting. Today’s panels cost less than half what they did in 2010, while producing nearly twice as much energy.

Solar panels build critical financial resilience, stabilizing budgets and protecting programs as philanthropy dollars fluctuate. For funders, few investments deliver such concrete, long-term results: a one-time grant lowers costs for decades, all while multiplying impact.

The bottom line is clear: Even as incentives phase out, solar remains the most responsible energy choice – both morally and fiscally. Philanthropy has a role to play in accelerating this transition, whether by funding solar projects directly, championing sustainability among grantees or modeling the shift themselves.

Act now to capture the best deal, but if you miss this window, remember: The sun keeps shining, and solar will continue to pay dividends — for your budget, your Jewish community and the planet.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.
Newport cleans up, plants trees to showcase change in the 1980s Saratoga Street, which runs through the center of Newport, is lined with trees.
“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport.
“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said.","For the second year in a row, Newport is planting a massive amount of trees. The city aims to add 1,000 to its west side by 2028 to address inequity in its tree canopy cover.

Only 10-12% of the western areas in Newport are covered by trees, compared to 24-54% in other neighborhoods, according to ReNewport, a community development nonprofit. People there also experience higher levels of heat stress, poor air quality and lower life expectancy.

The city hopes by planting more trees, more residents will have access to the benefits they provide, like shade, improved health and even increased property values.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.

Newport cleans up, plants trees to showcase change in the 1980s

Saratoga Street, which runs through the center of Newport, is lined with trees. They tower over nearby houses and cast shadows that reach across the road on sunny days.

Tom Ferrara remembers four decades ago when the trees were just saplings starting to take root where abandoned railroad tracks used to be.

“I'm sitting here looking at how big that tree is,” Ferrara said. “This is some of the last trees we planted.”

He was a city commissioner in the 1980s, part of a reform government working to clean up Newport and get rid of its 'Sin City' reputation.

“What we did behind the scenes — getting rid of gambling and all that kind of stuff — nobody saw that other than the people that used to come over here and do it,” Ferrara said. “So, we wanted to show something visible.”

Then-city manager Dennis Phelan started asking businesses along Monmouth Street if they wanted to buy a tree. Most got on board.

City crews cut up concrete sidewalks and filled them with dirt. Then on weekends, Phelan, Ferrara and a host of volunteers would get in the dirt and plant the trees.

“It was amazing, especially in the spring when they started to bloom,” Ferrara said. “Green on Monmouth Street? Come on. Other than the facades of the buildings, there was no vegetation out there. It felt good.”

Ferrara estimates, in all, the city planted more than 100 trees along Monmouth, York, Second and Saratoga Streets.

Branching out

Back then, trees were mostly being planted to beautify the city. Kate McElwain lived in the Gateway neighborhood and volunteered with both city and east side neighborhood tree plantings.

“We planted the 800 block of Maple. Of course, we put all Maples on there, which was kind of a mistake because if a certain disease comes, it's going to kill all the trees on the block,” McElwain said.

So far, they're standing tall.

McElwain says in time, people began to understand the role trees could play in their city in a different way. Research on the urban heat island effect shows the concrete-filled west side can be 10 to 20 degrees hotter than the tree-lined east side.

When McEllwain moved to the west side of Newport about a decade ago and felt the heat herself, she knew something had to be done. She and a group of neighbors banded together.

“Every year we did a tree planting,” McEllwain said. “It didn't matter... even if it was five or six trees, even if it was 10 trees. Every year, we put a couple trees in the ground.”

A new tree planting effort takes root

That laid the groundwork for today. The city of Newport got behind the west side residents' tree planting movement and, in 2023, it got a major boost from the federal government: a $1 million dollar grant to plant 1,000 trees.

Cities from New Orleans to Nashville also received federal dollars through the Inflation Reduction Act for similar efforts.

“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport. “It's better for our air quality. In an urban area like this, it helps the water runoff... It helps calm traffic. But, too, it just brings some vibrancy to the neighborhood. People want to be outside more when there's trees.”

This March, the Trump administration clawed back that money. Tunning says that’s not stopping the city from planting trees.

“We could wait around and complain about things not getting done, point the finger. Or we can get to know our neighbors, build friendships, build community, and say, ‘You know what, we're just going to work together and get this done,’ ” Tunning said.

The city's moving forward with help from state grants, private donations, and volunteers who give up their Saturday mornings to dig holes and put trees in the ground, just like in the 80s.

Back on Saratoga Street, former city commissioner Ferrara admires the trees he helped plant decades ago.

“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said. “We're growing, and we're continuing to grow, continuing to improve.”

Because of this, forecasts for EV sales over the next several years have been cut in half compared to what they were a year ago.

The average new car purchase price in the U.S. is roughly $48,000.This is somewhat uninformative considering that there are still some new cars that cost less than $20,000 and while others are priced in six figures. Regardless, electric cars are generally perceived as being more expensive than gas-powered vehicles. This is to some extent true, although it is often difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison. In any event, any intrinsic manufacturing cost advantages of gas cars are shrinking away.

Nonetheless, the situation has unquestionably damaged the electric car market. Manufacturers are employing various strategies to soften the blow, for example offering $7,500 credits on leases obtained through their separate leasing subsidiaries who purchased the cars before the expiration of the credit. At least 17 states offer tax credits for EV purchases, and some are increasing those credits. New York’s EV tax credit is $2,000.

While water and energy are often managed as separate resources in industry, adopting an integrated approach that combines energy and water management can improve energy efficiency and reduce water losses.
Efficiency measures that lead to water and energy savings can lower water and energy bills, create jobs, lower emissions and reduce risks related to water scarcity.
Combining energy and water management could help slash both energy and water losses and reduce costs.
There is emerging evidence that water conservation programmes can, in some cases, deliver even more energy savings than programmes that focus on energy efficiency alone.","The world has a water problem and industry can be part of the solution. Half the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, with poorer communities worst affected, threatening livelihoods, health and economic output. Industry could help address these scarcity issues by reducing their own water use and increasing energy efficiency.

Globally, the industrial sector is the second biggest user of freshwater after agriculture, accounting for just under 20% of freshwater withdrawals while simultaneously being the largest user of energy, accounting for almost 40% of the world’s total annual energy consumption.

While water and energy are often managed as separate resources in industry, adopting an integrated approach that combines energy and water management can improve energy efficiency and reduce water losses. Efficiency measures that lead to water and energy savings can lower water and energy bills, create jobs, lower emissions and reduce risks related to water scarcity. Many synergies emerge from an integrated view of energy and water management.

Water is essential for almost every aspect of supplying energy. Water is used in energy extraction and transformation for process cooling and other operational needs, and it is also used for the transportation of fuels and energy goods. On average, the global energy sector withdraws around 0.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) of freshwater for each 1 EJ of energy demand. By reducing energy use, water is saved too.

There are many inefficiencies in energy use in the industry sector. A recent analysis of the manufacturing sector in the United States, shows that just under 50% of all energy used onsite for manufacturing is lost. Globally, increased uptake of energy management and of AI-enabled savings in industry could result in 28% less energy being used to produce the same unit of value added in 2035. Considering the average volume of water needed to supply energy, this energy demand reduction would correspond to roughly 17 bcm less freshwater being withdrawn – that’s the same amount of water all municipalities in Sub-Saharan Africa used in 2020.

Globally, about 30% of freshwater is wasted due to leaks and inefficient use. This leads to more energy being used to extract, treat and transport larger volumes of water. In some countries, average losses in water supply and treatment systems reach 60%. Water users are also responsible for substantial losses. Analysis by Thames Water in the UK indicates that more than 25% of the water supplied to business customers could be lost due to leaks on premises. Some industrial sectors experience water losses as high as 50% due to leaks, outdated equipment, and inefficient practices.

Water leaks and inefficient use also lead to higher costs. Electricity costs typically account for 25–40% of a water treatment plant’s operational expense. Energy costs constitute almost 50% of the operating expenditures of desalination plants. Many industries, such as the semiconductor, pharmaceutical and food and beverage industry rely heavily on ultrapure water (UPW), which comes at an even higher energy cost for treatment (4 - 18 times more when compared to drinking water).

Combining energy and water management could help slash both energy and water losses and reduce costs. Integrated approaches, combined with better data, can provide a full assessment of costs and benefits of efficiency measures, including upstream and downstream impacts. Integrated energy and water audits, for example, could save companies time and money. Also, industry can often use water that has lower quality and is available on-site, such as process water or treated wastewater, reducing freshwater demand and saving on energy costs associated with water transportation.

There is emerging evidence that water conservation programmes can, in some cases, deliver even more energy savings than programmes that focus on energy efficiency alone. Implementation of water audits and recommended measures at industrial sites have been shown to deliver water savings in the range of 10-50% with additional savings of up to 20% in reduced costs for energy and water treatment chemicals.

A comprehensive analysis of water and energy use by the manufacturing sector in the United States indicates that investing in water efficiency is ten times more cost effective than investing in alternative water supply, and could result in water usage reduction of 60%.",https://iea.imgix.net/08b4c27b-c7ca-4236-86a4-6633fc2db551/shutterstock_2688869573_Integratedenergyandwatermanagementwillboostsavingsinindustr.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=0%2C117%2C800%2C400&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 05:19:24.049581

Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.
A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant.
""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead.
The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down.","Running a coal-fired power plant near Lake Michigan, which the Trump administration has ordered Consumers Energy to keep operating despite the company's plans to shut it down at the end of May, cost $80 million through September 30, the company said in a recent filing with federal regulators.

Consumers plans to spread the cost of operating the J.H. Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.

A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant. The company said it plans to file a request later this year with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover the costs of keeping the plant running.

Sanjay Narayan, an attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said emergency orders, like the one keeping the Campbell plant open, create a lot of uncertainty around the future because there is no long-term plan in place. “Each emergency order lasts 90 days, but it can be renewed, and the administration has already renewed it once,” he said.

“One consequence of not being able to plan is that you can’t make the best choices because you can’t reliably control what’s going to happen,” Narayan said. “And that’s going to cost people money.”

Coal: a dirty energy source

Narayan said coal is dirtier, more expensive, and less efficient than other energy sources like solar, battery, and wind power.

""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead. They are among the dirtiest industrial facilities,"" and the Campbell plant is one of many aging coal plants in the country that is unable to compete economically with more modern forms of generation, Narayan said.

Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer with the environmental group the Sierra Club, said Consumers was moving towards more advanced technologies and an evolving electricity grid, which contributed to the company's decision to close the plant, but the Trump administration had other ideas.

The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down. Consumers and the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, have both said their plans account for energy demands.

Smigielski said the emergency order was also motivated by a desire to provide energy for data center development for big tech and AI companies.

In a statement, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that “maintaining access to affordable, reliable, and secure power is always our top priority.”

The cost

Consumers has said its plan to end coal power generation, led by shutting down the Campbell power plant, was going to “save customers an estimated $600 million through 2040,” in addition to providing an array of environmental benefits.

Smigielski added that sulfur dioxide emissions from coal plants are tied to a wide range of health problems, including asthma attacks, heart disease, neurological damage, early onset dementia, and death, according to Smigielski.

“We don’t have a need for it in the community,” Smigielski said. “So all of its emissions, all of its costs … there’s not a lot of upside. It’s hard to name who’s actually winning from keeping it online.”

Smigielski added that he has received many complaints from Michigan residents. “They have said loud and clear that they do not want to pay for dirty energy generation. People that are already spending over 6% of their income on energy bills don’t have extra money to fund a coal plant we don’t need.”

“At the end of the day, these costs are going to be borne by the public, not Consumers,” Narayan said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b7836f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/558x293+0+62/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffe%2F66%2Fe1c887c8413ea1670a6b5a7ff371%2Fcampbell-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 05:19:28.299503

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Communities across the country have noted an increase in wildfires, heat waves and powerful hurricanes. These challenges have spurred debate among legislators, scientists and community members about how to maintain human livelihood while addressing issues such as biodiversity loss and pollution.

Origins of environmental policy in the United States

Environmental science in government policy has roots dating back to the mid-20th century. Americans began to have conversations about protecting the environment in the ’60s. Concerns about pollution, major oil spills and the Cuyahoga River’s spontaneous combustion heightened public awareness.

The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the first national legislation concerning air pollution which aimed to “provide research and technical assistance relating to air pollution control.”

However, that 1955 legislation dealt only with monitoring and research. The first legislation concerning the control and regulation of air pollution did not come until the Clean Air Act of 1963, which led to the establishment of a federal program in conjunction with the U.S. Public Health Service. The 1967 Air Quality Act later placed primary responsibility for air pollution problems on state and local governments, though “the federal government could step in if the state failed to adequately act on its own.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established in December 1970, following congressional approval of a reorganization plan proposed by former President Richard Nixon. Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 not only contained guidelines for the establishment of the EPA but also the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This allowed for a more coordinated and effective response to environmental issues than previous initiatives.

One significant piece of legislation was the Clean Air Act of 1970, later amended in 1977 and 1990, which regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The act establishes a national right to safe air, preventing polluting industries from simply relocating to more rural areas.

Some of the earliest research conducted by the EPA involved studying photochemical reactions of emitted chemicals, which led to further research on the correlation between ozone concentration and health effects. Over the following decades, research confirmed a clear link between ozone levels and adverse health outcomes.

Particulate matter, or soot, was also studied — generated from vehicles, industry, wildfires and “other combustion-related sources.” This led the EPA to issue the first air quality standards for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in 1997.

In response to evolving air quality standards, EPA researchers implemented Federal Reference Methods and Federal Equivalent Methods to measure air quality more accurately.

Plans and enforcement

The federal government sets national air quality standards, but state and tribal governments must enact and enforce those standards themselves. Each state can set stricter standards for emission sources than those required at the federal level.

One goal of the EPA was to set and achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal criteria air pollutants: nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone and lead. This could be achieved through state implementation plans by enforcing pollutant standards within each state.

A typical state implementation plan generally contains three main components: state-adopted control measures such as statutes and regulations; “non-regulatory” components or additional provisions required by the EPA; and plans for maintenance and enforcement. The EPA collaborates closely with state and local agencies throughout the development of these plans. Once a state implementation plan, or a portion of it, receives EPA approval, its control measures become federally enforceable.

If a state agency fails to submit an acceptable plan — or if the EPA disapproves the submission — the agency is required to establish a Federal Implementation Plan to ensure compliance with national air quality standards.

Current issues and actions

While significant improvements in air quality followed the Clean Air Act and its amendments, environmental challenges persist. In the late ’90s, transitions in climate cycles — coupled with ongoing changes in temperature, drought and snowmelt — likely contributed to conditions fueling more frequent and intense wildfires across parts of the United States.

Wildfire smoke is now one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of air pollution in the country, serving as the leading source of particulate pollution (PM2.5) in the western United States. It accounts for roughly 50–75% of annual PM2.5 emission and contains the same pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA determined that greenhouse gases are regulated under the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This decision significantly expanded the agency’s authority beyond traditional air pollution to include climate change mitigation.

Following the decision, the EPA introduced several initiatives, including the Clean Power Plan, which established a national carbon dioxide emissions performance rate for power plants.

While fossil fuels will continue to be an important source for the nation’s energy, the Clean Power Plan ensures that power plants operate in a more efficient and climate-friendly manner.

The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.
“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University.
“A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.” Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells.
Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.","Samsung SDI is reportedly in final talks with Tesla to supply around 3 trillion won ($2.1 billion) worth of energy storage system battery cells, signaling the US electric vehicle giant’s growing reliance on Korean battery makers amid Washington’s push to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains.

According to industry sources and media reports Tuesday, Tesla’s ESS division executives visited Korea last week and reached near-final terms with Samsung SDI on a multiyear supply contract. The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.

The Korean battery maker is expected to produce the cells at its joint venture with Stellantis in Indiana, converting part of the facility’s existing EV battery lines into ESS-dedicated production for North American clients, including Tesla.

“The reported deal likely involves cell-level supply for Tesla’s Megapack assembly lines in California,” an industry source said. “Tesla is expected to integrate the cells into its own Megapack ESS products.”

Samsung SDI’s domestic rival LG Energy Solution, which signed a contract in July to supply Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP ESS battery cells annually, is reportedly negotiating to raise that volume by 50 percent to 30 GWh. If both deals proceed, the combined Korean supply of cells to Tesla could reach 40 GWh per year.

Following reports of the potential deal, Samsung SDI’s share price jumped to a 52-week high of 354,500 won early Tuesday before easing to 335,500 won, up 2.6 percent at the closing bell. The company later confirmed discussions were ongoing but said “no details have been finalized.”

Industry observers say the potential Tesla contract would give Samsung SDI a much-needed boost after recent financial headwinds. In the third quarter, the company’s revenue fell 22.5 percent on-year to 3.5 trillion won, and it swung to an operating loss of 591.3 billion won.

Unlike LG Energy Solution and SK On, which operate independent plants in the US, Samsung SDI currently relies on its joint venture with Stellantis for North American output. Reports indicate the Indiana plant’s utilization rate remains below 50 percent due to the EV market downturn.

“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University. “A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.”

Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells. After the US imposed tariffs of around 60 percent on Chinese batteries, Tesla accelerated sourcing from non-Chinese partners and began limited in-house LFP cell production in Nevada.

The Nevada plant, with an annual capacity of 10 GWh, incorporates CATL’s design and equipment but will cover only a fraction of Tesla’s ESS needs. The company plans to scale total annual ESS capacity to 100 GWh within three years — meaning its current 50 GWh supply from in-house and Korean partners still meets only half that target.

“With US tariffs factored in, Korean-made LFP cells could achieve cost parity or even a price advantage over Chinese supplies,” another industry insider said.

According to Mordor Intelligence, the US ESS market’s installed capacity is projected to grow from 49.5 GW this year to 131.8 GW by 2030, representing an annual average growth rate of 21.6 percent.

Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.

Action 4a: Scale the workforce for nuclear energy development The potential rapid expansion of advanced nuclear power could create workforce opportunities for states.
Advanced nuclear energy projects may face significant workforce challenges, particularly because of shortages in critical skilled trades and specialized expertise required for building, operating, and maintaining advanced nuclear technology.
These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63","Strategy 1: Build public trust and acceptance

Public acceptance and community support are critical aspects of nuclear energy projects. Some residents may be nervous about living near nuclear energy sites because of historical concerns surrounding safety and waste disposal.11 Rather than dismissing risk perception, addressing uncertainties proactively and communicating risks appropriately, while building public trust in regulators and organizations involved in nuclear energy development, can lead to a better understanding of the risks and merits of nuclear energy.12 State regulators, nuclear energy developers, and technical experts can help earn trust through proactive, authentic, and continuous community engagement throughout the project life cycle.

Reflecting Deloitte’s “Infrastructure for Good” approach, building public trust requires more than outreach—it demands authentic, ongoing engagement that puts people and communities at the center. As highlighted in Deloitte’s “Community Engagement for Good” framework, “putting people at the center of infrastructure decision-making” is essential. By identifying, engaging, and collaborating with local organizations early and creating joint solutions, project leaders can ensure that nuclear initiatives are designed not just for energy needs but for lasting community prosperity.

Action 1a: Identify and engage local organizations

Community organizations, environmental groups, and interested public influencers could be engaged early and visibly on substantive issues. Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act13 requires community-benefit considerations and workforce-transition plans for the relevant areas before permits are issued. Every proposed nuclear site would convene a local stakeholder committee empowered to monitor environmental baselines and negotiate benefit packages (for example, tax stabilization, job training, air-quality monitoring). Measures such as regular town hall meetings and an online document portal—tactics used effectively by the Washington State Department of Ecology to involve residents in decisions regarding nuclear waste cleanup at the Hanford Site14—can give residents a meaningful voice and surface potential issues early, enabling developers to address issues, increasing the probability that well-designed nuclear projects proceed on time and on budget. In Kentucky, communities can self-identify as nuclear-ready communities, signaling that they have undertaken formal consultations with their citizens regarding hosting part of the nuclear supply chain and its citizens have agreed to engage industry.15 This streamlines the community engagement process, creates an initial down-selected list of viable sites for nuclear development, and starts the process from a mutually agreeable position.

Identifying and engaging local communities depends on a well-developed outreach strategy. Any project outreach can include a variety of community members in feedback solicitation and enable the accessibility of engagement meetings. As described in Deloitte’s framework for trusted communication,16 an effective outreach strategy taps into the three elements of trust: competency, humanity, and integrity. In the context of nuclear energy projects, an effective communication strategy, designed to build trust with communities, could include these key elements:

Competency: Developers and regulators can show that they fully understand all aspects of nuclear energy and how to mitigate risks in its use.

Humanity: State governments can show community members that they make decisions with genuine empathy and care for their constituents, and that they acknowledge and take into account residents’ concerns into the decision-making process.

Integrity: States and nuclear energy industry players can be transparent with local communities, providing clear insight into challenges and the development process.

Action 1b: Design feedback mechanisms to continually solicit and respond to the public

Community trust cannot be built without state representatives, legislators, regulators, energy developers, and utilities actively responding to community concerns, feedback, and desires. Mechanisms to solicit community feedback can exist throughout the nuclear energy project life cycle and result in tangible changes that community members recognize. Industry players involved in the siting and design processes of nuclear energy development can use public input gained early in the project to see that these designs and the location of sites are aligned with public values to minimize opposition to licensing processes. Community concerns can be addressed and reflected in the iterative design review process, thereby building public trust in regulators, developers, and other industry players.17 Additionally, mechanisms such as advisory boards, town halls, door-to-door campaigns, and other continual feedback mechanisms can enable these players to continually receive and respond to feedback.

Project leaders should consider being willing to dedicate the resources needed to both listen and respond to local communities, for example, with an agile, specialized team. States can create a “rapid response” team that anticipates communication needs and forms proactive plans at each step of the decision-making process. Assigning a proactive team to address nuclear energy communications would enable continual responses to the public throughout the licensing, siting, construction, and operation of the project, further building trust for nuclear energy advancement.

Strategy 2: Conduct comprehensive energy planning

Small modular reactors and advanced nuclear plants can deliver consistent, around-the-clock baseload electricity. For example, a single SMR can power approximately 300,000 homes, providing the grid stability needed to support both residential and industrial growth.18 Reliability is essential for energy-intensive sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, critical infrastructure and data centers, whose energy usage could triple by 2028.19 In these sectors, even brief power disruptions can have significant economic or social consequences. States can estimate where sufficient demand will exist to site possible nuclear energy assets and enable interconnection with the grid. By integrating advanced nuclear into their energy mix, states can help safeguard against fuel price volatility, reduce dependence on imported commodities, and enable a stable supply of electricity in the face of rising demand.

For instance, France's power supply is more reliable than many European countries due to its heavy reliance on nuclear power, which provides a stable, clean baseload, generating about 70% of its electricity with a fleet of 56 reactors.20 Thanks to its nuclear fleet, France’s electricity grid maintains a legal standard limiting supply interruptions to less than three hours per year—one of the most reliable levels in Europe.21 Nuclear energy enables consistent output, enabling France to maintain energy security and export surplus electricity, earning the country more than €3 billion per year from export activity.22

Action 2a: Perform energy strategy planning and modeling

To effectively integrate advanced nuclear technologies into their energy mix, states can develop a comprehensive energy strategy plan that aligns nuclear deployment with long-term energy goals, grid reliability needs, and decarbonization targets. This plan can begin with a holistic assessment of current and projected electricity demand, identifying high-demand regions like data centers or industrial hubs where SMRs’ consistent baseload power can provide maximum value. States can consider incorporating stakeholder input from utilities, industry, universities, and communities to prioritize energy security, and cost-effectiveness. By mapping existing infrastructure, such as transmission lines and retired generation sites, and forecasting future grid needs, the plan can pinpoint optimal advanced nuclear plants locations and integration strategies.

This strategic framework can set the stage for advanced modeling studies to demonstrate how nuclear energy can strengthen grid resilience, complement renewables, and support economic growth while minimizing risks and costs. States can leverage three key types of modeling studies to inform advanced nuclear buildout and deployment:

Strategic demand forecast modeling employs sophisticated forecasting tools to analyze future electricity demand, informing the optimal integration of nuclear energy into the grid to enable sufficient capacity, reliability, and alignment with long-term energy goals.

Economic viability and dispatch optimization modeling assesses the economic competitiveness of advanced nuclear plants by analyzing operational costs, fuel expenses, and maintenance alongside their integration with other grid-connected assets like solar and wind. This analysis optimizes dispatch strategies to minimize costs, maximize efficiency, and enable cost-effective energy delivery to consumers.

Transmission grid integration assesses the grid's physical limitations and identifies optimal locations. This analysis determines necessary transmission upgrades, enables efficient power delivery, enhances grid stability, and quantifies the impact of nuclear power on load balancing, decarbonization, and overall infrastructure needs, guiding strategic deployment decisions.

Action 2b: Guide strategic site assessment and regional collaboration

Comprehensive due diligence studies can help to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental viability of advanced nuclear energy deployment. These studies could consider site-specific factors, such as seismic risks, water resources, and proximity to high-demand sectors, while leveraging opportunities to repurpose retired power generation sites with existing infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Rigorous cost-benefit analyses, including decarbonization impacts, operational costs, and community support, are essential for informed decision-making and expedited project timelines. Wyoming's TerraPower project in Kemmerer exemplifies the benefits of this approach. The project team evaluated factors such as local community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability to obtain a license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and access to existing infrastructure and the needs of the grid.23 By combining rigorous site evaluations, technology assessments, and regional cooperation, states can accelerate advanced nuclear energy deployment, minimize disruptions, and maximize economic and environmental benefits.

Action 2c: Strengthen energy security and emergency response frameworks

Nuclear power can maintain electricity supply during most extreme weather events, including hurricanes, extreme heat or cold, at times when other energy sources may experience disruptions.24 Between 2010 and 2020, lost generation due to weather-related events in the US nuclear fleet was less than 0.1%. Nuclear plants can deliver steady baseload power even when fuel supplies, supply chains, or portions of the grid are compromised, helping maintain critical services during disasters.25 Building on this strength, states can leverage tools and resources from the US Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) to prepare or strengthen energy security plans.26 These plans can incorporate the advanced tools CESER has developed in collaboration with industry and the national laboratories to address a spectrum of threats, including natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, operational incidents, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could have an impact on nuclear operations or grid stability. The Council of State Governments and the National Emergency Management Association can also contribute to sharing effective strategies across states, ensuring alignment with national standards like those set by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.27 For example, North Carolina developed an Energy Security Plan in alignment with CESER’s frameworks, and provided a strategic roadmap to assess energy supply risks, strengthen security, and enable rapid recovery, offering a model for states to safeguard nuclear energy deployments, and deliver reliable, affordable energy.28

With the growing digitalization of energy infrastructure, cybersecurity has become a critical pillar of emergency preparedness for nuclear deployments. Advanced nuclear plants rely on advanced control systems and grid interconnections that are vulnerable to cyber threats, including ransomware or targeted attacks on critical infrastructure. States can work with CESER’s Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment program to implement robust cybersecurity standards, conduct regular threat assessments, and develop incident response protocols tailored to advanced nuclear facilities.29

In addition to providing resilient power, advanced nuclear plants incorporate safety enhancements that further reinforce emergency preparedness. Advanced nuclear designs include passive safety systems, like passive cooling, that do not require operator action or external electricity to prevent overheating, even in the most severe scenarios.30 By integrating these advanced nuclear energy innovations into emergency planning, while proactively managing physical and cyber risks, states can safeguard nuclear operations, maintain grid stability, and build lasting public trust in nuclear energy’s role as an anchor of energy security and resilience.

Strategy 3: Create regulatory structures and incentives

The technology behind small modular and other advanced reactors is progressing rapidly, creating potential economic opportunities for states. For states that plan to incorporate nuclear power into their future energy portfolio, the real test in the coming years is whether policy frameworks can keep pace. Long, sequential reviews and permitting processes, uncertain cost-recovery rules, and weak price signals can add years and billions of dollars to a project’s timeline, while every gigawatt that does reach the finish line can support thousands of well-paid, qualified jobs and sustained economic growth. Early state-level initiatives, from Illinois’s Zero Emission Credit program31 to the fast-tracked permits in Tennessee,32 Wyoming,33 and Virginia,34 illustrate how legislatures, utility commissions, and economic-development agencies can coordinate their levers to create a more favorable environment for future nuclear projects and pave the way for a markedly more profitable industry, aligned with long-term energy goals.

The following policy actions—drawn from emerging state experience—offer a practical playbook for turning nuclear ambition into investible reality:

Action 3a: Streamline permitting and regulatory processes

Long, fragmented approval timelines are one of the biggest cost drivers in nuclear development. Even after a company secures a federal license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it often still needs separate state and local signoffs for land use, water rights, transmission interconnection, tax treatment, and environmental reviews.35 Because these processes typically run in sequence and vary from county to county, developers could finance multiyear “dead zones” with no revenue in sight, which can add hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense and deter would-be investors. States control virtually every other permit on the critical path, so their ability to synchronize and accelerate those reviews is central to making projects viable.

A traditional reactor can spend almost a decade in preconstruction limbo. One-stop approaches in Idaho36 and Wyoming37 for mining and carbon-capture projects demonstrate that faster does not have to mean looser; there can be concurrent reviews, clear timetables and direction on the steps, and early engagement with local communities.

Action 3b: Attract investment and secure cost recovery

Securing investment for a new reactor begins well before concrete is poured and most of the bill comes due long before a single kilowatt-hour is sold. The first hurdle is therefore to de-risk the up-front phase so developers can raise the billions required to break ground; the second is to assure investors that their initial investment will be repaid while the plant is still under construction.

States are tackling the front-end challenge by pairing predictable, guaranteed minimum revenue with public-sector credit enhancements. For example, Illinois established a pioneer Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program in 2016 to provide financial support to at-risk nuclear power plants.38 Under this program, utilities are required to purchase ZECs at a fixed price, creating a stable revenue stream for nuclear operators. This mechanism helped ensure the continued operation of the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants, demonstrating how guaranteed revenue can de-risk investment and attract the necessary capital for nuclear energy projects.39 Some banks in Connecticut and New York have gone a step further, layering in subordinated loans and loan guarantees that cover roughly 15% of the total cost. By absorbing first losses, they crowd in senior lenders who may otherwise price the risk too high.40 Indiana now authorizes 40-year securitized bonds whose maturities match a reactor’s economic life,41 while the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems consortium in the Mountain West uses take-or-pay contracts in which each of its dozens of city-owned utilities agrees to pay for its share of the plant’s output whether it ends up taking the power or not, so all participants share the risks and rewards together.42 Together, these tools could narrow or eliminate the equity gap that typically stops first-of-a-kind builds at the drawing board.

Because first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear projects lack a proven cost track record, several states have adopted conditional financial incentives to help manage project risk, while aiming to limit the effects on ratepayers. These include grants or tax credits that are contingent on qualifying activities, such as research, development, or construction, as well as cost-recovery provisions that allow utilities to recoup development expenses during the early stages of a project. For example, Virginia enacted legislation that allows utilities to recover up to 80% of their advanced nuclear development costs—such as engineering, licensing, and site permitting—on a current basis from ratepayers, providing early-stage financial certainty and helping to de-risk investment in first-of-a-kind nuclear projects.43 Similarly, Indiana enacted a tax credit equal to 20% of qualified investments made in manufacturing small modular nuclear reactors in the state and specified that tax credits can be carried forward.44 At the federal level, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) has utilized a milestone-based funding approach, releasing funds in phases as projects achieve specific technical and regulatory milestones.45 States could potentially implement similar milestone-based support mechanisms, which would encourage innovation and promote the investment of public funds in projects that demonstrate measurable progress and risk reduction.

Once the funding is in place, the focus can move to bridging the period between breaking ground and the moment the plant starts producing electricity and earning revenue. Construction-work-in-progress accounting (CWIP) enables utilities to place verified expenditures into the rate base as they occur, turning sunk costs into billable assets and preserving investment-grade credit.46 Florida employs a similar statute,47 and more than 10 other states now authorize some form of advanced-nuclear cost recovery, typically reinforced by prudency audits and performance-based true-up accounting that align shareholder returns with on-time, on-budget delivery.48

When revenue certainty, first-of-a-kind risk mitigations, subordinated public capital, long-term bonds, and balanced cost-recovery mechanisms operate in concert, they can help turn nuclear energy from a speculative gamble into a financeable infrastructure play, attracting cheaper capital, anchoring local supply chains, and accelerating the clean-energy transition.

Action 3c: Modernize market design to reward clean firm power

Most wholesale markets pay primarily for the next kilowatt-hour of energy, not for its multiple attributes, such as zero carbon, on-demand availability, and voltage support, that keep the lights on when solar production fades and gas prices spike. This focus can discourage investment in resources like advanced nuclear that, despite operating 24/7 with minimal emissions, requires long-term revenue certainty to secure financing. Because states set integrated-resource planning rules, oversee utility cost recovery, and influence regional market tariffs, they hold some of the levers to broaden compensation from the cheapest electrons now to the highest system value in the long run.

In multiple states, policy shifts are beginning to reflect that broader view. Washington State’s Clean Energy Transformation Act explicitly designates nuclear as a clean-firm asset that can satisfy utilities’ decarbonization mandates, providing a profitable compliance pathway.49 Illinois50 and New Jersey51 have extended their Zero-Emission Credit programs to prospective builds, turning avoided carbon into a predictable revenue stream rather than a retrospective subsidy. The California Public Utilities Commission is currently considering a staff proposal for technology-neutral, round-the-clock capacity solicitations that would enable nuclear to compete directly against combinations of renewables, storage, and demand response on the basis of reliability-adjusted cost.52 Industry analyses help back the economic case: Electricity markets with remuneration mechanisms such as capacity markets or contracts for difference, which recognize the contribution of nuclear energy to system reliability and resilience, are essential for supporting new nuclear investments, especially as grids incorporate higher shares of variable renewable energy.53

Action 3d: Collaborate regionally to amplify impact beyond state borders

Advanced reactors are capital-intensive assets designed to serve regional rather than strictly local demand. Stand-alone utility load forecasts and competitive market structures may not provide sufficient market signals to incentivize the development of a large nuclear reactor, especially in mid- and smaller sized markets, indicating the need for collaboration or shared investment approaches among utilities. Fragmented state rules on siting, cost recovery, and transmission planning often compound the problem by forcing every project to negotiate a unique regulatory maze. The result is chronic under-subscription: Developers struggle to line up enough credit-worthy offtakers, while states pursuing go-it-alone strategies miss out on economies of scale and may leave federal incentives on the table. Because states control zoning, resource-planning mandates, and most retail-rate design, they are uniquely positioned to convene multi-jurisdictional coalitions that pool demand, standardize criteria, and unlock shared infrastructure.

For example, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s study of multistate cost allocation for new transmission54 illustrates how coordinated planning can lower unit costs and shorten schedules. By agreeing on common siting parameters and synchronized procurement, member states create a single, reliable market rather than a patchwork of small bets. In April 2025, the governors of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on nuclear energy development.55 This tri-state agreement focuses on multiple topics, including aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment, jointly navigating regulatory and environmental, and coordinating infrastructure development. A report published by the Southeast Nuclear Advisory Council shows the potential payoff for regional collaboration. In the Southeastern US region alone, the nuclear industry generates nearly $43 billion in annual economic impact, supports more than 152,000 jobs, and contributes $13.7 billion in labor income and $3.7 billion in annual tax revenues across five states. Interstate collaboration is key to achieving these outcomes, as it enables states to pool resources, harmonize workforce development initiatives, and coordinate supply chains—ensuring a steady pipeline of skilled talent and robust technical support for advanced nuclear projects.56 By working together, states can streamline regulatory processes, accelerate technology deployment, and may attract greater private investment, ultimately maximizing the economic and innovation benefits of advanced nuclear energy for the entire region.

Together, these four actions form a practical playbook that moves from siting and licensing through financing, revenue certainty and regional collaboration can help convert nuclear energy from a perceived high-risk gamble into a competitive advantage for economic development.

Strategy 4: Develop the workforce and supply chain

Advanced nuclear energy presents a significant opportunity for states to develop a new skilled and diverse workforce. The deployment of advanced nuclear energy and exploration of fusion technologies will increase the demand for talent in areas like construction, operations, manufacturing, and supply chain management. Achieving the US target to quadruple US nuclear capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050 will require a dramatic workforce expansion.57 According to the US Department of Energy, in 2024, approximately 100,000 workers supported the operation of nearly 100 GW of nuclear capacity.58 By 2050, an estimated 375,000 additional workers will be needed—100,000 for ongoing operations and 275,000 for construction and manufacturing.59 This potential surge in demand spans a wide range of skill sets, from engineers and reactor operators to welders, electricians, project managers, and supply chain specialists. States can position themselves as leaders in nuclear innovation by ensuring they have a workforce trained in advanced technologies and supported by local supply chains. By focusing on localizing the nuclear supply chain and using state-level incentives, states can meet the demand for nuclear energy while also promoting economic growth and creating career opportunities for their residents.

Action 4a: Scale the workforce for nuclear energy development

The potential rapid expansion of advanced nuclear power could create workforce opportunities for states. To realize the full potential of this sector, states can take a proactive approach to developing a robust, skilled, and varied talent pipeline—one that spans technical and nontechnical roles across construction, operations, manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain management.

Advanced nuclear energy projects may face significant workforce challenges, particularly because of shortages in critical skilled trades and specialized expertise required for building, operating, and maintaining advanced nuclear technology. To address these gaps, states can take proactive steps such as identifying and tracking constrained trades and critical skill shortages, offering financial incentives to attract and upskill workers, and establishing regional education and training programs in partnership with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions. Additionally, broadening recruitment and outreach initiatives to include non-traditional talent such as local unions, technical schools, high schools, adjacent industries, veterans, and former industry workers can be beneficial to building a robust nuclear workforce.

Action 4b: Identify and address potential workforce gaps

States can move beyond general workforce expansion and directly address specific gaps in skills and labor availability. This requires a data-driven, collaborative approach to workforce planning and development.

States could proactively:

Map current and future needs: Conduct comprehensive assessments to identify critical skill shortages and forecast future workforce requirements for advanced nuclear energy projects. Evaluate whether robust, granular data systems and tracking capabilities exist to identify workforce-related gaps. Additionally, assess whether existing workforce development institutions have the expertise and resources to address the unique labor demands of nuclear energy.

Leverage data and partnerships: Use labor market analytics and collaborate with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions to align training programs with real-time needs. Facilitate coordination among workforce development agencies, economic development authorities, and industry partners to maintain an up-to-date understanding of evolving skill requirements and respond quickly to changing market signals.

Targeted upskilling and reskilling: Develop and fund specialized training, apprenticeships, and certification programs for high-demand roles in nuclear construction, operations, and supply chain.

Expand talent pools: Launch outreach initiatives to attract workers from adjacent industries, Navy veterans with nuclear training, and local communities.

Monitor and adapt: Establish mechanisms to track progress, measure outcomes, and adjust strategies as workforce needs evolve.

Pennsylvania has leveraged its existing nuclear infrastructure to attract major private-sector investment. In partnership with Amazon, the state facilitated the development of data centers adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna nuclear facility. Amazon has committed to investing at least $20 billion in Pennsylvania to build multiple high-tech cloud computing and AI campuses, creating at least 1,250 high-paying tech jobs and thousands of construction roles, the largest private investment in Pennsylvania history.60 The initiative includes partnerships with local schools and workforce organizations for training and STEM education, while the state will invest $10 million in workforce development to support the further growth of that industry in the state.61

States can work to develop a skilled and diverse workforce for the nuclear sector through input and output economic modeling, strategic workforce development, and advising effective incentives and recruitment. By fostering collaboration and creating nuclear-specific technical education pathways and apprenticeships, states can attract the talent needed for successful nuclear energy deployment and operation.

Action 4c: Localize and lead the nuclear supply chain

Deploying advanced nuclear energy plants, as well as fusion technologies hinges on establishing robust, localized supply chains, robust inventories, and component redundancies for critical components such as reactor vessels, cooling systems, specialized valves, advanced fuels, and unique control systems. This positions states to become first-movers in a competitive global market. States can achieve this by investing strategically in nuclear manufacturing capabilities, fostering innovation through state-funded research and development grants, and creating economic zones to attract different types of manufacturers with tax incentives, infrastructure support, and streamlined permitting processes. Key actions include launching specialized training programs at community colleges and vocational schools to build a skilled manufacturing workforce, forging strong partnerships with domestic and international suppliers to enable a resilient supply network, and coordinating regional efforts to establish advanced manufacturing hubs that align supply chain strategies with national energy goals. States can also collaborate with industry stakeholders to share information and analyze supply chain vulnerabilities, with a special focus on identifying risks and gaps related to the most critical components in the nuclear value chain. This localized approach not only supports nuclear energy deployment but also drives economic diversification, generates high-skill jobs, and reduces potential reliance on foreign supply chains.

Virginia’s 2023 nuclear innovation package demonstrates the power that state-level incentives can have in driving workforce and economic development.62 By awarding competitive grants to support workforce development, research, and education, they established partnerships between the state’s universities, community colleges, and industry leaders. These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/null:1200-x-627,N,,2025-11-04 03:58:52.386659

Just a year ago, the sector seemed poised for rapid growth, with East Coast states making offshore wind a centerpiece of their clean-energy and reliability strategies. Today, that progress has been sharply interrupted.

The reversal has been swift. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has halted new federal leases and permits and ordered work stopped on projects already under construction, moves that put billions of dollars in investment at risk. By September, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum declared that, under current policy, there is no future for offshore wind in the United States.

Yet the industry’s troubles, despite strong progress, began well before this political turn. Inflation, high interest rates, and supply-chain disruptions sharply increased project costs, forcing developers to cancel or renegotiate contracts. Earlier, states had made strategic missteps in their race to capture offshore wind jobs and supply-chain investment, leaving the industry more exposed to shifting economic and policy winds.

Elizabeth Wilson of Dartmouth College, founding director of the Irving Institute for Energy and Society, discusses how these experiences have shaped an emerging body of “institutional learning” across the states—lessons in risk sharing, coordination, and governance that may help buttress the industry for the long term.

The agreement provides price certainty for the project while supporting the state’s renewable energy targets and grid decarbonisation objectives.

In total, 1.1GW of renewable energy projects were selected for an LTESA.

The Stubbo Solar project will generate approximately 1,000GWh of electricity annually and features nearly one million solar PV modules across the site, which will continue to support grazing activities underneath and between the solar arrays in the form of agrivoltaics.

Readers of PV Tech will likely be aware that Acen Australia committed to recycling one million modules from the 400MW solar PV power plant last week, making Stubbo Solar the first large-scale project to earn certification from the Circular PV Alliance.

ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington hailed the project’s completion, stating that its development started “long before” the policy frameworks now shaping Australia’s renewable energy landscape were in place.

“As the market evolves, costs are rising, delivery conditions are changing rapidly, and market dynamics are shifting – these pressures are real, and they reinforce the importance of partnership between government and industry to ensure policy settings remain responsive, effective and investment-ready,” Pollington added.

Acen Australia began construction of the 400MW PV project in 2023, with the facility now amongst the largest solar projects built in Australia.

Stubbo Solar includes provision for a future 200MW/800MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), positioning the site to provide firming capacity as the electricity grid transitions to higher renewable energy penetration.

The battery component will enhance the project’s ability to provide dispatchable renewable energy during periods when solar generation is unavailable.

The project’s financing structure demonstrates the scale of ACEN Australia’s renewable energy development program. ACEN Australia completed AU$750 million debt financing for 1.3GW of renewables, supporting multiple projects across the company’s development pipeline. The financing package enables the company to simultaneously advance construction on several large-scale renewable energy facilities.

The project generated approximately 400 jobs during the construction period. The facility connects to TransGrid’s high-voltage transmission network, enabling efficient delivery of renewable energy to population centres across the National Electricity Market (NEM).

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

Technology Roadmap Through 2050 Industry projections indicate near-zero emissions ironmaking technology could capture 35-45% of global steel production by 2050, representing a complete transformation of the industry.","The steel industry stands at the forefront of a revolutionary transformation with near-zero emissions ironmaking technology, which promises to eliminate over 95% of carbon dioxide emissions from traditional steel production. This groundbreaking approach replaces coal-dependent blast furnaces with hydrogen-powered systems, fundamentally altering how iron ore transforms into metallic iron. Furthermore, this technological shift represents a critical component of the global energy transition strategy, addressing one of the most carbon-intensive industrial processes.

The technology centres on replacing carbon-based reducing agents with hydrogen gas, fundamentally altering the chemical reactions that transform iron ore into metallic iron. This shift eliminates the primary source of CO2 emissions in steelmaking while maintaining product quality and production efficiency.

Core Technology Components

Modern near-zero emissions ironmaking relies on three interconnected technological systems working in harmony. Hydrogen-based direct reduction reactors serve as the primary processing units, where iron ore undergoes chemical transformation using hydrogen as the reducing agent. Electric smelting furnaces powered by renewable energy sources handle the final melting and refining stages.

Advanced gas recycling mechanisms capture and reprocess hydrogen throughout the system, maximising resource utilisation while minimising environmental impact. These integrated systems operate at lower temperatures than traditional blast furnaces, typically between 800-900°C, which reduces energy consumption while achieving superior environmental performance.

Environmental Impact Comparison

Production Method CO2 Emissions per Ton Primary Energy Source Water Byproduct Traditional Blast Furnace 2.1-2.3 tons CO2 Coal and coke Minimal Near-Zero Hydrogen Process 0.05-0.1 tons CO2 Renewable hydrogen Water vapour only Improvement Factor 20-45x reduction 100% fossil-free potential Zero harmful emissions

How Does Hydrogen-Based Direct Reduction Transform Iron Production?

Hydrogen direct reduction fundamentally reimagines the metallurgical processes that have defined steelmaking for centuries. Instead of carbon monoxide from coal combustion, this technology employs hydrogen gas that reacts directly with iron oxides at controlled temperatures and pressures.

The process follows the chemical equation: Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Fe + 3H₂O, producing only water vapour as a byproduct. This reaction eliminates carbon dioxide emissions entirely at the reduction stage, representing the most significant environmental advancement in steel production technology.

Chemical Process Breakdown

The hydrogen reduction process occurs in multiple stages, each optimised for maximum efficiency. Iron ore particles are exposed to hydrogen-rich atmospheres where oxygen atoms bond with hydrogen rather than remaining with iron. The resulting metallic iron maintains the same structural properties as traditionally produced material while requiring approximately 30% less energy per ton.

Temperature control proves critical throughout the process, with precise management ensuring complete reduction while preventing unwanted side reactions. However, modern process technologies enable advanced monitoring systems that track gas composition, temperature gradients, and reaction progress in real-time.

Fluidised Bed Reactor Innovation

Revolutionary fluidised bed reactor (FBR) technology allows fine iron ore particles to react directly with hydrogen without requiring expensive pelletisation processes. This innovation reduces capital investment requirements by eliminating pelletising plants, which traditionally consume 3-5% of total steelmaking energy.

""Fluidised bed systems can process iron ore fines with particle sizes as small as 0.1mm, expanding the range of suitable raw materials and reducing preprocessing costs significantly.""

The fluidised bed design creates optimal contact between hydrogen gas and ore particles, achieving reduction rates 40-60% faster than conventional shaft furnace systems. This acceleration translates to smaller reactor footprints and reduced capital costs for new facilities.

What Role Do Electric Smelting Furnaces Play in Clean Steel Production?

Electric smelting furnaces (ESF) represent the final transformation stage in near-zero emissions steel production, where hydrogen-reduced iron undergoes melting and chemical refinement using electricity rather than fossil fuel combustion. These systems achieve temperatures exceeding 1600°C through electric arc or induction heating methods.

Renewable Energy Integration

When powered by renewable electricity sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation, ESF systems achieve complete decarbonisation of the smelting stage. This integration requires sophisticated energy management systems capable of handling variable renewable power supply while maintaining consistent steel production quality.

Grid integration technologies including battery storage and demand response systems enable steel plants to operate efficiently with intermittent renewable energy sources. In addition, some facilities achieve 90% renewable energy utilisation through strategic scheduling and energy storage deployment, aligning with broader sustainability transformation initiatives across the manufacturing sector.

Operational Advantages Over Traditional Methods

Electric smelting furnaces offer several operational benefits compared to traditional blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace combinations:

Precise temperature control enabling consistent product quality

Rapid startup and shutdown capabilities supporting flexible operations

Reduced maintenance requirements due to fewer moving components

Lower emissions of particulates and sulfur compounds

Modular design allowing incremental capacity expansion

Which Companies Are Leading Near-Zero Emissions Ironmaking Development?

BHP and POSCO Strategic Partnership

Technology learning curves improving efficiency and reducing capital costs

Scale economies as production volumes increase globally

""Current green hydrogen costs of $3-5 per kilogram must decline to $1.50-2.00 per kilogram for full cost competitiveness with coal-based steelmaking.""

How Does Hydrogen Supply Infrastructure Support Clean Ironmaking?

Green Hydrogen Production Requirements

Near-zero emissions ironmaking demands approximately 55-65 kg of hydrogen per ton of steel produced, representing massive hydrogen consumption volumes. A typical 2 million tonne per year steel plant would require 120,000-130,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually, equivalent to the output from 2-3 GW of dedicated electrolysis capacity.

This hydrogen demand is driving unprecedented investment in renewable-powered electrolysis facilities. Current global electrolysis capacity totals approximately 0.3 GW, requiring expansion by a factor of 100-150 to support widespread steel industry adoption.

Supply Chain Optimisation Strategies

The concept of ""Green Iron Corridors"" envisions integrated industrial complexes co-locating hydrogen production, iron ore processing, and renewable energy generation. These clusters minimise transportation costs while maximising operational efficiency and energy utilisation.

However, advanced process control systems and real-time monitoring technologies are essential for maintaining consistent product specifications.

Quality assurance systems must address potential variations in iron ore composition, hydrogen purity levels, and operating conditions. Statistical process control methods help identify and correct deviations before they impact final product quality.

Scale-Up Engineering Challenges

Moving from demonstration-scale facilities to full commercial production requires solving complex engineering challenges related to reactor sizing, gas flow dynamics, and thermal management. Industrial-scale systems must handle material flows 50-100 times larger than pilot plants while maintaining uniform processing conditions.

Critical scaling considerations include:

Reactor geometry optimisation for uniform gas-solid contact

Heat transfer management in large-scale systems

Material handling systems for continuous operation

Process safety systems for hydrogen-rich environments

Maintenance accessibility in industrial-scale equipment

South Korea's Samsung SDI 006400 said on Tuesday it is in talks to supply energy storage batteries to Tesla TSLA, in an order that Korean media said could be worth more than 3 trillion won ($2.11 billion).

Samsung SDI shares soared more than 8% on the news.

A deal would mark the latest push by Tesla to reduce reliance on China for key parts, fueled by tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Tesla has signed deals with South Korean companies Samsung Electronics 005930 and LG Energy Solution 373220 to source chips and batteries in recent months.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centers.

South Korean battery makers are repurposing electric vehicle battery production lines to also produce energy storage systems as they are hit by the elimination of U.S. subsidies.

Samsung SDI said in an earnings call in October that it has seen a big fall in automotive battery demand from joint venture partner Stellantis STLAM, and will tweak some of its production lines in the U.S. state of Indiana to make energy storage batteries.

A source told Reuters that Tesla and Samsung SDI are discussing supplies of energy storage batteries, while another person said that the annual supply volume would be 10 GWh.

The South Korean newspaper Korea Economic Daily, which first reported the potential deal, said the three-year supply deal would be valued at more than 3 trillion won.

Tesla did not have an immediate comment. A Samsung SDI spokesperson said the deal and its details have not been finalised yet.

Tesla said in an earnings conference call in October that its energy storage business is seeing headwinds due to the increase in competition and tariffs. ""Currently all sales procured are from China while we're still working on other alternatives,"" it had said.

This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments.

The United States has withdrawn from multiple key climate finance and mitigation pledges since COP29, leaving major gaps in funding and progress.

Regulatory frameworks for carbon markets and methane mitigation are advancing, even as nations fall short of meeting these goals.

Each year at the United Nations (U.N.) climate change summit, formally known as the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries from all over the world—alongside companies, non-governmental organizations, and subnational governments—convene to set new climate goals while building on past commitments to confront the climate crisis.

While the expectation is that these commitments will result in measurable action, there is no guarantee as it is challenging for countries to ultimately hold each other accountable. This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments. In November 2024, COP29 resulted in numerous advancements, such as the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance (NCQG) as well as the finalization of technical guidance for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which is related to carbon markets. There were also developments related to previous agreements like the Loss and Damage Fund and Global Methane Pledge. This article will summarize where these key efforts stand.

New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance

After lengthy negotiations, COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded with countries agreeing on an updated climate finance commitment to support developing countries’ climate action plans. The NCQG consists of core financing of $300 billion annually through 2035 from developed countries, with an additional call for $1.3 trillion per year, primarily from private financing. The NCQG is a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, with Article 9 stating that “developed country parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties.” COP29’s NCQG expands both quantitatively and qualitatively on the first climate finance goal of $100 billion per year, established at COP15 in 2009. The new goal specifies transparency guidelines and improved access arrangements, in addition to outlining channels for disbursement and different financial instruments that can be used. Despite the expanded financing, many countries and observers have expressed that NCQG is not ambitious enough, as it represents merely a fraction of developing countries’ climate finance needs. According to Carbon Brief, developing countries' climate finance needs are already predicted to reach $200 billion a year by 2030 even without additional efforts, indicating that the latest NCQG is inadequate to address the larger, growing need for climate funding. By some estimates, developing countries need $2.7 trillion annually by 2030 to meet their climate goals.

After COP29, negotiators, experts, and stakeholders gathered in summer 2025 at the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Seville, Spain, to address financing challenges related to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. This event marked the first time the FfD process was meaningfully connected to UNFCCC decisions. The resulting document, the Seville Commitment, called for resources to support the NCQG and other UNFCCC decisions.

Meanwhile, the United States has made dramatic cuts to its climate finance portfolio since COP29. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which had historically provided about one-third of all U.S. climate finance (including $3 billion in 2023), has been shuttered. Though some of its operations have been moved to the State Department, much of them have been canceled. Due to significant budget cuts in 2025, 150 climate and clean energy contracts and grants worth $1.2 billion have been terminated. The United States also withdrew its commitment of $4 billion for the Green Climate Fund, which provides climate-related grants and loans to developing countries. These cuts directly impact the NCQG target of raising $300 billion from developed countries every year.

The U.N. Environmental Programme’s (UNEP’s) Adaptation Gap Report 2025, issued in October 2025, found that the NCQG-–which covers both mitigation and adaptation—will not be achieved unless adaptation financing is dramatically increased. The report underscores the drastic gap in adaptation funding for developing countries, noting that wealthy countries are not upholding their commitments. They promised $40 billion annually by 2025 in adaptation aid but provided only $28 billion in 2022 and $26 billion in 2023 with limited signs of a turnaround. And the $40 billion goal is in any case completely insufficient compared to the $365 billion per year in adaptation funding that developing countries need according to the United Nations. The report does highlight that countries have made progress on closing the planning and implementation gap, with 172 countries now having a national climate adaptation plan.

Ahead of COP30, the COP29 and COP30 presidencies jointly announced the Baku to Belém Roadmap to $1.3 Trillion to support NCQG implementation. In April, the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (the country presiding over COP30) identified five priority areas to support the roadmap: multilateral development bank reform, the expansion of concessional finance and climate funds, improvements to domestic capacity to attract sustainable investments, the development of innovative financial instruments for private capital mobilization, and improved regulatory frameworks for climate finance. The two presidencies issued an initial working plan in May 2025, with June updates highlighting further consultations and engagement opportunities. COP30 will facilitate further discussion on how to implement and ensure accountability and transparency of the NCQG.

Loss and Damage Fund

Stakeholders at COP29 signed key agreements to fully operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which was launched at COP27 to address permanent climate change harms in developing countries. At the signing ceremony, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev declared that funding would flow in 2025. “This is an important win for vulnerable communities,” he said. “It is the result of years of work.”

In April, the U.N. Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage met in Barbados to discuss strategies to roll out funding. The workplan, named the Barbados Implementation Modalities, will provide $250 million between 2025 and 2026 to developing countries to respond to climate losses and damages, with 50% of the Fund’s capital going to small island states and the least developed countries. Participating countries have pledged around $760 million to the Fund, but have only paid $321 million so far. The United States pulled out of the board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage in March 2025, raising doubts as to whether its pledged $17.5 million will be fulfilled. The Fund’s $760 million commitment is still well shy of the $400 billion needed to fully cover developing countries’ permanent climate costs, according to the Loss and Damage Collaboration.

Article 6 Carbon Markets

COP29 marked progress on the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 as countries agreed on international standards for a centralized carbon market, in addition to a mechanism for updating the standards. Carbon markets are trading systems through which countries may buy or sell units of permitted greenhouse gas emissions (“carbon credits”) in an effort to meet their emission reduction targets. The centralized standards agreed upon at COP29 are intended to direct resources to developing countries, save up to $250 billion per year when implementing national climate plans, and vastly accelerate climate plan implementation.

Since COP29, the European Union has proposed reintroducing international carbon credits to help meet its 2040 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% relative to 1990 levels. The proposal would allow the European Union to use these international credits starting in 2036 to meet up to 3% of its 2040 climate target, provided they meet ""robust and high integrity"" criteria and align with Article 6. Indonesia also announced that it will allow international trade in carbon credits to resume after its 2021 moratorium. Prior to the moratorium, Indonesia was one of the largest suppliers of carbon credits to the international market. This new decree aims to attract foreign investment and advance Indonesia’s 2060 zero-emissions climate target.

The governments in Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have also launched and expanded plans this year for their respective countries' carbon credit regulations. Looking to COP30, the three countries announced the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative designed to boost voluntary demand for carbon credits.

Global Methane Pledge

Announced at COP26, the Global Methane Pledge aims to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels. The United States, Azerbaijan (the COP29 presidency), and China led a summit at COP29 on reducing global methane and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions to make further progress toward the pledge’s goal. In 2024, 159 countries, along with the European Union, signed the pledge (however, membership alone does not signal action). According to the International Energy Agency, current methane policies and regulations are projected to reduce emissions by around 25% by 2030, falling short of the goal.

The Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) has been a significant part of the U.S. commitment to the Global Methane Pledge goal, providing up to $1.36 billion to reduce U.S. methane emissions through monitoring, detection, measurement, and quantification. However, with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L.119-21), $150 million dedicated to helping companies and communities cut emissions has been rescinded, and the program’s 2024 Waste Emissions Charge for polluters has been delayed until 2034. MERP’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for oil and natural gas facilities, is also being reconsidered as of October 2025.

Meanwhile, a number of other countries have announced plans to reduce their methane emissions. In 2024, the European Union announced its regulation on the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector, which targets methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. China issued a new air pollution standard, the Coalbed Methane (Coal Mine Gas) Emission Standard, which requires coal mine operators to capture gas with an 8% or higher methane concentration and a flow rate of at least 10 cubic meters per minute. Kazakhstan has also made headway on reducing methane emissions by announcing a commitment at COP29 to develop methane regulations in the fossil fuel sector as well as upholding fines on companies violating flaring regulations. In the private sector, the U.N. Environmental Programme’s International Methane Emissions Observatory reported that over 150 energy companies—representing 42% of global oil and gas production—are improving their methane reporting.

Other notable updates

COP26 in 2021 saw the launch of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), an initiative by wealthier nations to help fund clean energy transitions in coal-dependent developing nations. Since then, the program has mobilized $50 billion in pledges from the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan (among others) to be directed to energy transitions in South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal. This year, the United States withdrew from JETP, leaving the remaining funder countries to fill in the gaps.

COP27’s Early Warnings for All Action Plan (EW4ALL) called for targeted investments of $3.1 billion between 2023 and 2027 to improve disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings for every person on Earth. EW4All National Consultative Workshops were held in The Gambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Belize, and Guyana in 2025 to advance this goal. The U.N. Development Programme announced a five-year project starting in 2025 to improve multi-hazard early warning systems for the most vulnerable communities in Antigua and Barbuda, Cambodia, Chad, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, and Somalia.

COP29 marked the first COP that included tourism in its action agenda, with talks culminating in the COP29 Declaration on Enhanced Action in Tourism signed by over 70 countries, including the United States. This declaration builds on momentum from COP26’s Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. On World Tourism Day in September 2025, global leaders, industry experts, and community leaders met in Malaysia at the World Tourism Conference, which was themed “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation.” The event highlighted talks about driving sustainable tourism forward.

Despite throwing barbs at Spanberger, Trump avoided key opportunities to endorse Earle-Sears by name.
On a call for Ciattarelli, Trump was effusive in praising the former Assembly member and business owner who he said loves the state and is fighting for lower costs.
“Mikie Sherrill will send New Jersey Jersey into a death spiral,” the president said.","TOTOWA, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey Republicans are trying to ride the coattails of Donald Trump’s 2024 electoral momentum, with gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli courting voters in a key — and traditionally Democratic — stronghold that contributed to the president’s gains in the state.

Ciattarelli and Virginia candidate Winsome Earle-Sears are crisscrossing their respective states, while Trump spoke at telephone rallies with voters later Monday. This comes after their opponents, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, campaigned over the weekend alongside former President Barack Obama.

It’s a delicate balance for Republicans, who want to catch some of Trump’s electoral energy by drawing infrequently voting conservatives to the polls while not dismissing concerns about increasing costs. Democrats are urging voters to see the off-year election as a referendum on Trump’s economic policies and his efforts to expand his power.

Trump said Monday that Virginia voters should back “Republicans up and down the ballot” in an effort to make the state more affordable. “Republicans will bring back everything that you want,” he said at the virtual town hall alongside Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Still, the president was seemingly hesitant to assert himself in the race. Despite throwing barbs at Spanberger, Trump avoided key opportunities to endorse Earle-Sears by name. The lieutenant governor did not speak during the call.

On a call for Ciattarelli, Trump was effusive in praising the former Assembly member and business owner who he said loves the state and is fighting for lower costs.

“Mikie Sherrill will send New Jersey Jersey into a death spiral,” the president said.

Ciattarelli paid a visit to a crowded Irish bar in Passaic County, one of the traditionally blue areas that highlighted Trump’s strength in 2024. It’s also a county where the Department of Justice is set to send poll watchers.

At the bar, a reporter pointed out the president’s absence on the campaign trail and asked Ciattarelli: Is Trump a “liability” to him? The candidate was also asked to respond to attacks from his opponent that he would not stand up to the Republican president.

“New Jerseyans know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day,” Ciattarelli said.

The stop featured a surprise appearance of the candidate’s son, Army Capt. Jake Ciattarelli, who flew in from Kuwait and showed up in uniform. Defense Department regulations impose broad restrictions on troops participating in partisan activity, especially in uniform, in an effort to maintain the military’s historically apolitical role in American society.

Sherrill, the Democratic opponent, spoke in Morristown, where her first campaign for Congress in 2018 got its start. She tried to cast the contest in New Jersey in clear national terms.

“It’s going to be up to the next governor to take on the federal administration to claw back as much money as possible and have them in court if they refuse to run programs that they should be running for the people of New Jersey,” Sherrill said. She has seized on the Trump administration’s decision to abruptly freeze funding for a project on the Hudson River to replace the aging rail tunnels that connect New Jersey to New York City.

In Virginia, Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin was knocking on doors for Spanberger and other Democrats. He said he felt confident that Democrats’ focus on affordability would pay off on Tuesday.

Martin said he felt the diverse array of candidates, from Spanberger and Sherrill to Zohran Mamdani, the party’s New York City mayoral candidate, did well because they put the economy at the forefront of their campaigns.

“People are going to vote their pocketbook issues, their kitchen table issues, their own family anxieties about their future, before any other issue they care about,” Martin told The Associated Press.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/11/6909512d3501a1.98989418.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 00:58:31.684255

We were the state that put the world on wheels and powered a great American century. That legacy of leadership, building and innovation is precisely what the Michigan House of Representatives voted to reclaim last week by passing House Bills 4124-4129, a bipartisan package designed to cement Michigan’s place at the center of the Great American Nuclear Renaissance.

Nuclear energy is the essential foundation for a secure and independent energy future. It operates 24/7, keeping our hospitals running, our manufacturing lines moving and our homes heated, regardless of the weather. By paving the way for next-generation reactors, we’re ensuring our grid is robust, reliable and ready for the demands of tomorrow.

But this bill package is more than just an energy policy; it’s a comprehensive blueprint for economic leadership and job creation. We are building a complete ecosystem right here in Michigan.

Investing in our people: We are establishing higher education grants to help colleges, universities and trade schools create and expand specialized training programs in nuclear and hydrogen technologies. This ensures high school graduates have a direct, affordable path to high-paying, skilled-trade careers, keeping our best and brightest right here in Michigan.

Attracting and retaining talent: The package creates a workforce attraction and retention scholarship program, offering grants and credits to graduates who commit to working at a nuclear or hydrogen facility in Michigan for at least three years. This is a deliberate strategy to grow our technical workforce and compete with neighboring states for talent.

Incentivizing innovation: We are introducing research and development tax credits to spur the design and development of next-generation reactor technology. We’re also implementing a production tax credit to reward companies that commit to manufacturing, refining and deploying that technology in our great state. We want them to build the future of energy in a state that knows how to build things.

This successful vote in the House reflects a powerful coalition — business groups, labor unions, academics, utilities and even environmental organizations — all united behind a single, shared vision. The momentum is undeniable. With the historic restart of Palisades already underway, and this comprehensive policy framework advancing, the world is watching Michigan.

We’ve cleared the House. Now, it’s up to the Michigan Senate to act swiftly to pass this essential, bipartisan package. Let’s send this to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk and show the nation that Michigan is still the state that innovates, leads and is ready to define the future of American energy.

The green transition is not a single act of redemption; it is a vast material process, and like every process it leaves marks on the world.
When green turns geopolitical The green transition is no longer just an environmental project.
The green transition is no longer a story about carbon.
The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security.","The global transition to clean energy is often treated as an unquestioned moral good. Electric cars line up in glossy advertisements as symbols of virtue — the modern expression of a world finally learning to live within its limits. To drive electric is supposed to represent being on the right side of history.

But moral certainty can be a dangerous comfort. Decarbonising the planet is an ethical imperative, but how we pursue it matters no less than why. The green transition is not a single act of redemption; it is a vast material process, and like every process it leaves marks on the world.

The quest to save the planet from the consequences of one resource is, quietly, being fuelled by another. Let me explain what I mean.

The hidden weight of clean energy

Cars are responsible for roughly 15 per cent of global carbon emissions, and electrification is central to the effort to decarbonise transport. Yet electric cars, for all their climate promise, come with a far larger appetite for raw materials.

An electric car is, in essence, a moving assemblage of the Earth’s most precious elements. Beneath the clean surface of its design lies a complex web of extraction: nickel, cobalt, lithium, graphite — each mined from landscapes that pay their own hidden price. On average, building an electric car requires several times more raw minerals than a petrol car. And as the world races toward electrification, the demand for these materials is set to multiply many times over in the next two decades.

This points to an uncomfortable truth: the clean-energy transition is, in material terms, one of the most resource-intensive undertakings in human history. And these minerals are not evenly distributed across the planet.

In effect, the world’s decarbonisation effort depends on a handful of regions that bear the environmental and human burden of extraction — places where clean energy’s promise looks very different from its marketing. The transition that aims to reduce carbon in the atmosphere risks increasing pollution, inequality and vulnerability elsewhere.

Cobalt is largely mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where artisanal miners — many of them children — dig by hand in dangerous conditions, feeding a global supply chain that is often opaque. Nickel increasingly comes from Indonesia, where the high-pressure acid leaching process used to extract it generates toxic waste and large greenhouse emissions if powered by coal.

Lithium is drawn from brine fields in Chile’s Atacama Desert, where water use has sparked tension with local Indigenous communities and ecologists. Graphite, though abundant, is overwhelmingly refined in China, which has introduced new export controls, and has turned processing into a strategic chokepoint.

For many of these countries, the irony is painful. They supply the world with the minerals essential for the clean-energy transition, yet they see little of the wealth it generates.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, produces almost three-quarters of the world’s cobalt, but earns a fraction of the profits once the metal leaves its borders to be refined elsewhere. Indonesia, despite its vast nickel reserves, relies heavily on foreign investment and technology for processing — a dependence that often limits local economic returns and deepens environmental risk.

This imbalance reveals an old pattern in a new disguise. Nations rich in natural resources, yet poor in processing capacity, are forced to sell their raw materials cheaply, while wealthier economies capture the high-value stages of the supply chain.

The energy transition may be green, but it is not automatically fair. Without deliberate reforms, it risks repeating the same colonial logic: extraction in the Global South to sustain consumption in the North.

When green turns geopolitical

The green transition is no longer just an environmental project. It has become an enormous industry — and with trillions of dollars at stake, a geopolitical one. The minerals that power the clean-energy economy are now instruments of national strategy, quietly replacing oil as the currency of global influence.

The green transition is no longer a story about carbon. It’s a story about power. The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security. China, which dominates their refining, has tightened export controls in quiet assertion of its leverage. Europe is legislating self-sufficiency. The technologies designed to stabilise the climate are now reshaping the world’s balance of power. The green race is, increasingly, a minerals race.

What began as a moral and environmental imperative has become a geopolitical chessboard. And that shift raises a deeper question: if the pursuit of a cleaner planet reproduces the same extractive patterns and rivalries that scarred the last century, have we really changed course?

Who pays the price of progress?

As demand climbs, attention is shifting from land to the ocean floor — one of the last resource frontiers we barely understand. Across the Pacific, especially in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawai‘i and Mexico, the seabed is scattered with potato-sized polymetallic nodules rich in nickel, cobalt and manganese: exactly the metals modern batteries need.

Why look offshore at all? Because nodules offer high metal concentrations without digging pits or clearing forests. But the trade-offs are different, not smaller. Collecting nodules with seabed vehicles can crush slow-growing organisms, generate sediment plumes that spread far beyond the mining track, and disturb carbon-rich layers that have been stable for millennia.

Governance is racing to catch up. The International Seabed Authority is still finalising a mining code to govern commercial extraction in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Several state-sponsored contractors and private consortia are positioning themselves to apply once rules are in place, while a number of countries and scientific bodies have called for caution or moratoria until ecological risks are better understood.

The stakes are not only environmental. Many of the likely operational areas lie within or adjacent to the interests of small Pacific Island states that depend on healthy oceans yet have limited leverage in global supply chains.

In plain terms: the same pressures that once mapped oil politics onto deserts and coastlines are beginning to map battery-metal politics onto the deep ocean.

The ethics of the green future are complex

The clean-energy transition will not be judged only by how fast it cuts emissions, but by how fairly it shares its costs. The next phase of climate policy must reckon not just with carbon, but with conscience.

We already know the mechanics: smaller cars, better recycling, cleaner supply chains. But policies that treat the planet as an engineering problem miss something deeper. The transition is also a social contract — one that links the comfort of a driver in Melbourne to the safety of a miner in Kolwezi or a fisherman in Sulawesi. The true test of climate policy is whether it narrows those moral distances or deepens them.

This will demand more than technological optimism. It will require transparency about where materials come from and under what conditions, trade agreements that value environmental standards as much as efficiency, and public subsidies that reward restraint rather than excess. A future of heavier, more luxurious electric SUVs, powered by ever-larger batteries, would be a moral paradox dressed as progress.

Governments can set rules, but markets respond to demand — and that means us. The green industry will happily sell a car whose battery contains “dirty nickel”, if consumers remain content to drive it. If we truly care about sustainability, we must also care about the unseen human and environmental costs behind it, and demand better.

That means asking harder questions before we buy, supporting companies that source responsibly, and accepting that cleaner supply chains may cost more. Real change will not come from guilt, but from insistence — insisting that the technologies of the future are built on the ethics of the present.

Ethical consumption cannot be passive, and it may not be cheap either. If we care about clean energy, we must also be prepared to say so with our wallets and votes.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b2551142aac41a4bfedbe6b7d58895cc?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=234&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-04 00:01:27.611312

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network filed suit Friday against Atalco Gramercy LLC in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The company operates the Atlantic Alumina facility that straddles the border of St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

The 17-page pleading is based largely on pollution discharges state inspectors discovered during a series of visits to the facility beginning last year. The Illuminator detailed the extent of the pollution and its impact in a series of reports this year. The reports shed light on the high concentrations of toxic metals found in water and soil samples collected from the polluted areas. Much of the information was unknown to neighboring residents and local leaders.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has cited the facility for dozens of violations stemming from breaches in the levees surrounding the facility’s “red mud” waste containment lakes and numerous wastewater discharges into the river that exceeded permitted limits.

Atalco did not respond Monday to a request for comment.

The lawsuit cites many of the regulatory violations in a 606-page inspection report the Department of Environmental Quality began in September 2024 and completed in March. It also includes violations LDEQ inspectors discovered in subsequent visits to the facility in May and June.

Runoff from Atalco alumina refinery into Mississippi River raises environmental concerns

“In the aggregate, this litany of violations demonstrates that Defendant’s lack of care for the proper operation of the Facility has been reckless and with egregious disregard for the environmental and human impacts of its mismanagement,” the lawsuit states.

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network is asking the federal court to award an unspecified amount in civil penalties and legal fees and to declare Atalco’s unpermitted actions as violations of the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The group is also asking for an injunction to prevent further violations and require Atalco to install appropriate treatment technology at the facility.

Atalco refines bauxite, a rust-colored rock containing raw metals, at the refinery into alumina, turning it into an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum.

Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States, making itthe nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.

For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atalco stores the waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud containing highly corrosive and toxic chemicals, in large containment ponds surrounded by 50-feet-high levees.

In August 2024, federal inspectors discovered breaches in some of Atalco’s levees in which the toxic slurry formed erosion channels and flowed offsite into public areas. State inspectors then discovered several more levee breaches in the subsequent months. Atalco made repairs to its levees but inspectors found new erosion channels during a follow-up visit in May.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8788-scaled-e1762215226969-2048x1232.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:50.174455

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on Trump’s unprecedented use of an emergency powers law to slap broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada and other major trading partners.

On social media Trump has called it “THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER” and repeatedly claimed that the Ontario government’s anti-tariff ad campaign featuring an address by the late Ronald Reagan was an attempt to interfere with the case.

Many billions of dollars are at stake. If the administration loses in the Supreme Court, it may have to return tariffs paid by importers since the spring and will forgo a source of revenue that Trump has claimed is making America rich again.

Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit in Washington, D.C., says the stakes are also high for the functioning of U.S. democracy and for the Supreme Court.

“They have so far in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs,” Wydra said in an interview with CBC News. “From a separation-of-powers, constitutional standpoint, the question is huge.”

Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the power to tax or tariff, unless it passes a law that gives the president that authority.

Trump used a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy broad-based tariffs over a pair of what he declared to be national emergencies: the cross-border trafficking of fentanyl (for tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China) and the deep trade deficits the U.S. has with dozens of countries around the world (what Trump called his “Liberation Day” tariffs).

What the case hinges on

Whether IEEPA gives the president the legal authority to impose tariffs in this way and for those reasons is the fundamental issue before the court.

The case does not test the long-established power of a president to impose tariffs sector by sector, as Trump has done with imports of steel, aluminum and automobiles, to protect specific U.S. industries.

More than 40 organizations, individuals and interest groups have submitted “friends of the court” briefs ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in an effort to sway the justices.

Nearly all of those submissions, also known as amicus briefs, urge the court to rule that Trump’s use of IEEPA is illegal.

The list of those who’ve submitted legal briefs opposing the tariffs crosses a wide range of ideology, geography and profession, including some high-profile names:

Carla Hills, the former U.S. trade representative and lead negotiator of NAFTA in the George Bush administration.

Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, whose name is on a brief from a group of academics.

Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who served as successive chairs of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2018, are among the signatories of a brief from economists.

There are also friend of the court submissions from:

A group of small businesses in Florida who say they’ve been ‘grievously harmed by the illegal tariffs.”

Another group of import-dependent small companies led by a clothing business called Princess Awesome.

The owner of a small vineyard in Oregon whose lawyers say he believes empowering the president to impose tariffs in this way would be “the most evident unconstitutional transfer of legislative authority in his lifetime.”

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation, saying the tariffs “will ultimately hurt, not help, the economy.”

The submissions by the Trump administration’s legal team paint a completely different picture.

The tariffs “are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders,” says the main submission to the court from Solicitor General John Sauer on behalf of the Department of Justice.

Sauer says that IEEPA empowers the president with “a broad range of tools” to address international emergencies, and tariffs should not be excluded as an option.

His predecessors have used its powers to levy sanctions on enemy regimes, to ban transactions with groups that are deemed terrorist organizations or to freeze the assets of designated transnational criminal organizations.

Wydra says neither the long-running trade deficits nor the cross-border fentanyl trafficking are actually the kind of “unusual and extraordinary” threats that give the administration the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.

“Even if they did, they don’t have the power to enact tariffs this big. And even if they had that authority, they don’t have the authority to enact tariffs for an indefinite period of time,” she said.

Trump said last month that he might attend the oral arguments, but ruled it out Sunday night.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.
CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial “Big Beautiful Bill” passed in July ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious, and significant, step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways … when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/240823-ValenciaTelegraphBikeLanes-33-BL_qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 19:18:04.470596

And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities.","AMERICAN energy policy is currently locked in a fierce battle between people who say renewables will make electricity less expensive and people who say they won’t.

You’d think there would be a reasonably clear answer to this question, but this a case where both sides have it wrong.

Environmentalists, citing the falling costs of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, tend to agree with Bill McKibben that “power from the sun and wind is now the cheapest power in the world.”

Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright says that renewables “raise the system cost of electricity” because they are only intermittently available, and President Donald Trump’s administration is doing everything in its power to block their deployment.

In fact, the best answer to the question of how renewables affect retail electricity prices is unsatisfying: It depends.

As a new report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory makes clear, the extremely varied geography of the United States means that the cost per megawatt of generation is extremely variable.

In addition, the economic value of a given increment of renewable energy depends on what else is going on.

The adminstration’s argument that wind and solar power are essentially useless because they’re not dispatchable on demand is wrong.

For starters, batteries – which turn any source of electricity into a dispatchable one – are getting better all the time.

But beyond that, non-dispatchable power is useful because it complements other sources of power.

A renewables-heavy electricity grid might function better, for example, with gas-fired plants that ramp up and down according to how hard the wind is blowing.

The presence of wind turbines would still dramatically reduce gas consumption and therefore generation costs.

At the same time, environmentalists like to use metrics like the “levelised cost of energy,” which make renewables look cheaper than they really are.

It’s fine to look at how many megawatts a given solar array generates over the course of a year and calculate that this adds up to a low cost per megawatt.

But you still have to consider the cost of keeping the system up and running when the sun isn’t shining.

Value deflation

The big problem here is the concept of “value deflation.” When you start adding renewables to a previous all-fossil grid, they are extremely valuable.

You can use every electron your new solar panels generate, and save money by burning less coal, oil and gas.

As you add more, the price of daytime electricity falls. But that means that adding even more solar panels becomes less attractive.

If you keep doing it anyway, the only way to make use of your extra solar power is to add batteries, which add costs.

And while gently ramping your fossil fuel usage up and down to save fuel during times of high renewable generation is cost-effective, at a certain point you find yourself bearing high costs to maintain extensive amounts of backup infrastructure.

This is where a critical distinction drawn by the Lawrence report comes in.

In many states, mostly red ones like South Dakota and Texas, there are no policies in place to encourage renewable adoption, but the falling cost of wind and solar infrastructure has led to large investments that have lowered costs.

But other states, mostly blue ones, have adopted “renewable portfolio standard” policies designed to force utilities to increase their reliance on renewables regardless of whether it makes economic sense.

These policies raise costs.

It’s an awkward quirk of political fate that most of the states with the best geographic fundamentals for wind and solar growth happen to be politically conservative states on the Great Plains.

Conversely, the Northeast is politically progressive but not especially windy or sunny.

What’s more, renewables take up a lot of space, and northeastern voters tend to be reluctant to cut down forests or take up green space to build utility-scale renewable projects.

Misguided policies

The result is some very misguided policies, such as Maine’s now-eliminated programe to subsidise rooftop solar generation.

Because roofs are small and rooftop solar installations are labour-intensive, they are not very cost-effective compared to larger renewable projects.

Maine is also just not a very good place for solar power, as it’s not very sunny and is so far north that there is huge seasonal variation in the hours of daylight.

But geography isn’t everything. California has plenty of sunshine, and a non-coerced market would lead to plenty of renewable use.

But that wasn’t good enough for California policymakers, who’ve insisted on pushing the envelope on regulatory mandates, which have contributed to rising costs.

On some level, this debate is both unsurprising and inevitable.

Renewables emit less pollution than oil and gas, so environmentalists are willing to pay some economic cost to accelerate their adoption.

This is a tough sell for voters, though, so proponents of renewable energy are left with two discordant arguments: On the one hand, they say, renewables will reduce costs. On the other, they say that they are worth adopting even when they aren’t cost-effective.

None of this, however, comes close to justifying the Trump administration’s anti-renewable zeal.

In many places that neither mandate nor discourage renewable growth, renewables are growing rapidly in ways that reduce costs.

The price of batteries is steadily falling, meaning the amount of renewables the grid can efficiently absorb is growing. What’s more, electricity demand is now rising after a generation of stagnation, which means concerns about value deflation are much less pressing.

Environmentalists should admit that their preferred agenda of maximum feasible decarbonisation costs money compared to just letting markets and technology work.

And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities. — Bloomberg

That framing assumes the transition will mean less: less energy, less growth, and a steady decline in fossil fuel use. But this rhetoric is, as Ambassador Anthony Agotha put it at last week’s Berlin Climate Security Conference, a “false choice.”

The reality is far more complex — and far more uneven across countries and regions. The question isn’t whether the transition will happen, but whether it will happen everywhere, in time, and in ways that foster stability and economic opportunity.

Building Partnerships to Unlock Economic Opportunities

For many low- and middle-income countries, the challenge isn’t a lack of climate ambition — it’s a lack of energy access. Globally, there are about 750 million people who still lack steady and reliable electricity.

Nowhere is this more evident than in sub-Saharan Africa, where about half of the population — an estimated 600 million people — lack access to electricity. Now, consider the pace of growing demand in the region, whose population is projected to nearly double by 2050, from 1.3 billion to 2.1 billion. In Somalia, for example, where only 50% of the population currently has access to electricity (just 24% in rural areas), the population is expected to double from 19.7 to 38 million people over the same period.

For many low-income countries, the “energy transition” is not about decarbonization — it’s about unlocking enduring economic development opportunities by providing power to homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals. But expanding energy infrastructure while lowering emissions will require financial, technological, and political partnerships that prioritize energy access by de-risking investment and localizing clean energy technologies and jobs. Without partnerships that provide an on-ramp for countries to simultaneously grow their economies and expand access, the global transition will stall.

Flipping the Narrative on Decline

Discussions of climate ambition are often framed as being in tension with energy and economic security. But fossil fuel dependence — with its price volatility, supply disruptions, and concentrated control — is rarely the picture of stability.

The question is not whether countries can balance climate ambition with energy security — it’s whether they can afford not to. Done right (recognizing that there is a lot packed into those two small words), the energy transition can be a pathway to stronger economies, more stable societies, and more secure futures.

The economics of clean energy are shifting fast. In 2024, renewables met 83% of global increases in electricity demand, according to Ember, with solar generation up 33% and wind up 7%. Yet the benefits are not evenly distributed. China and India were largely responsible for those increases. The International Energy Agency reports that only 15% of global clean energy investment — about $2 trillion annually — has gone to the Global South (excluding China). Meeting global targets will require that share to rise five- to seven-fold by 2030, reaching $1.7 trillion per year.

Meanwhile, the economic toll of climate inaction is already staggering. Between 2014 and 2024, nearly 4,000 extreme weather events affected 1.6 billion people and cost the global economy an estimated $2 trillion. In just the past two years, global economic damages reached $451 billion — a 19% increase over the previous eight years. In some countries, a single disaster can erase more than a year of GDP.

Last year, in the United States alone, 27 weather and climate disasters led to the deaths of 568 people and cost more than $1 billion in damages, collectively totaling $182.7 billion — about 20% of the Department of Defense’s budget for that year.

In fragile and conflict-affected states, the consequences are even more devastating. In 2023, torrential rains from Storm Daniel — made 50% worse by climate change, according to research — caused two dams to burst in Libya, killing nearly 6,000 people. Years of underinvestment in water infrastructure and near-total dependence on oil exports left Libya’s economy both highly exposed and poorly equipped to adapt.

The assumption that the energy transition will mean a simple, linear decline in fossil fuel use is misleading. Global energy demand continues to rise, but again, the drivers of that demand vary widely. In industrialized countries, AI is driving an increase in power-hungry data centers. But for poorer countries — those least responsible for climate change — energy access remains essential to development and industrialization. For many of those countries, fossil fuels are a necessary part of the equation. The question, then, is not if they are used, but how — with what technologies, under what rules, and with what accountability. Framing the transition exclusively around fossil fuel decline risks alienating the very countries that must be part of it. A better narrative is one centered on diversification, modernization, and energy security — not scarcity.

Pathway Dependency

The success of the global transition depends on what the largest economies (and largest greenhouse gas emitters) do — and how consistently they do it. Last April, acting assistant secretary of international affairs at the U.S. Energy Department, Tommy Joyce, said that net-zero policies put the US at a disadvantage compared to China. “…There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

China’s control over critical minerals and clean energy supply chains gives it enormous leverage, but it didn’t get there on its own. China’s accelerated economic growth presented an existential challenge to global ambitions to rein in global warming. The first decade of the 2000s was marked by significant cooperation between the U.S. and China, including a US-China Clean Energy Research Center. But while China adopted large-scale, industrial policies to solidify its leadership on renewable energy and elevate its role on the global stage, policy vacillations and inconsistencies in the U.S. have created structural disadvantages that hobble U.S. innovation, industry, and market access.

And while climate ambition has grown since the 2015 Paris Agreement, global emissions have not yet begun to decline. Much of the growth comes from emerging economies that still lack the means to transition quickly. Africa, for example, holds 60% of the world’s best solar potential yet receives less than 2% of global clean energy investment.

The energy transition is not a zero-sum game. It is an opportunity — to expand access, build economies, and ensure a more secure and sustainable future. Getting there requires reframing the conversation from one of limits to one of possibility, grounded in partnerships and a broader and longer-term perspective.",https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1719187151.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:38.915052

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How We Got Here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world—especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars—especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric Vehicles Are Cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An Opportunity for Cleaner Electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions—it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built—and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A Virtuous—or Vicious—Cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector—eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes—is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition—it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors—power generation and transportation—while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

Renewables and storage backlog grows

NextEra is well positioned to serve hyperscale tech companies who may be required to bring their own generation if they want to interconnect to the grid, Ketchum said. It can attract customers initially with the rapid deployment of renewable resources and energy storage — the company signed contracts for 1.9 GW of battery storage in the third quarter — and follow up later with gas generation, Ketchum said. The company also has the ability to build transmission and new natural gas lines to serve data center campuses, he said.

At the same time, NextEra plans to renegotiate a growing number of power purchase agreements on existing assets for higher prices as those contracts begin to expire, Ketchum said.

“Returns have [never] been higher than I’ve ever seen them in this industry,” he said. “It’s just supply and demand. It’s that simple. There’s a lot of demand out there, and there’s just not as much supply to match it. And so that’s commanding premiums in the market and high and attractive returns.”

Its NextEra Energy Resources, or NEER, subsidiary added 3 GW of renewables and storage to its project backlog in the third quarter, including 1.9 GW of battery storage, 800 MW of solar and 300 MW of repowering existing projects, the company said.

The additions brought the company’s total backlog of renewables to 29.6 GW, net 1.7 GW of projects that were placed into service and 900 MW that were removed from the queue due to permitting and other delays.

Ketchum said he expects all or most of the delayed 900 MW to return to the backlog at a later date.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6rVR7glnFAZJf9g0kadNiQzGXjppdVlq6Rki6_6pqQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IQ0VfQnJvbmNvUGxhaW5zSUktMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-03 18:19:02.908902

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2025/01/carbon-capture-pipelines-generic.png,N,,2025-11-03 22:17:18.079838

Schneider Electric Canada is implementing a strategy to promote low-carbon fuels through technological partnerships with domestic industries. The company is leveraging its experience in Denmark, where its automated solutions power the world’s first commercial e-methanol facility, to demonstrate the industrial viability of this model in Canada.

A proven model for new alliances

The Kassø facility in Denmark produces up to 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually using renewable electricity from a 304-megawatt solar park and captured biogenic carbon dioxide. The industrial site is fully automated with Schneider Electric technologies and operates through an integrated digital platform combining energy management, automation, and industrial software.

Based on this experience, Schneider Electric Canada aims to expand the approach through partnerships with energy producers, industrial operators, and technology suppliers across Canada. The objective is to support these players in transitioning to low-emission operations while securing energy and operational performance.

Technologies supporting joint projects

The company highlights a suite of technologies including Modicon M580 programmable logic controllers, Altivar Process low-voltage drives, and Trihal dry-type transformers. These solutions are interconnected via the AVEVA System platform, enabling centralised facility management and real-time resource optimisation.

This system allows for the creation of Unified Operations Centres (UOC), capable of coordinating multiple industrial sites with remote control and enhanced energy performance. These tools support the deployment of joint projects, notably in refining, chemicals, or heavy transport.

The Canadian market as a deployment ground

Schneider Electric considers Canada’s renewable resources, national technical expertise, and supportive regulatory environment as favourable conditions for developing alternative fuels such as e-methanol. The company is engaging in discussions with several potential partners to replicate the Danish model within Canada.

Schneider Electric’s leadership asserts that these partnerships are essential to accelerating the energy transition of industries while strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial base. By structuring a joint offer based on automation, digitisation, and energy management, the company aims to build a long-term collaboration ecosystem around clean fuels.

Literally burning that money.” — Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.
The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.
“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.
But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.","The U.S. Department of Energy has announced up to $100 million in federal funding for projects modernizing the nation’s remaining coal plants, nearly half of which were slated to close by 2030.

The investment, a fraction of what would be needed for a comprehensive upgrade, is unlikely to make coal power more affordable, energy experts and anti-coal advocates say.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the Notice of Funding Opportunity, calling for applications to design, implement, or test refurbishments and retrofit systems that allow coal plants to “operate more efficiently, reliably, and affordably.”

The announcement outlined three key areas for development projects: advanced wastewater management systems, systems that enable plants to switch between coal and natural gas, and advanced “co-firing” systems that allow simultaneous combustion of both fuel types.

The funding comes just a month after the department announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” America’s coal industry.

That investment already included $350 million to recommission closed coal power plants or modernize plants and $100 million for the three development areas outlined in Friday’s announcement. The DOE did not respond to questions about why additional funds were announced just a month later.

Trump’s investments in coal are a drop in the bucket of what would realistically be needed to revamp the plants, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

“Those types of retrofits for a single plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Solomon. “To do that for every plant in the coal fleet, you’re looking at billions of dollars. And you’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

In April, following Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” executive order, the Department of Energy rolled out a series of actions intended to reinvigorate American coal production. The department reinstated the National Coal Council as a federal advisory committee, offered long-term financing for coal infrastructure, designated coal as a critical material and mineral and ended a moratorium prohibiting new coal mining leases on federal land.

“You’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

— Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation

Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal industry and workers, resulting in the closure of reliable power plants and higher electricity costs,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the report. “Thankfully, President Trump has ended the war on American coal and is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Yet Trump’s attempt to save coal from the brink is unlikely to succeed.

In 2001, coal made up half of the electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States. Today, it accounts for less than a fifth of generated power; the decline reflects the changing energy landscape.

The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.

Analysis by Energy Innovation found that coal prices increased 28 percent between 2021 and 2024, while inflation rose only 6 percent in that time.

At 99 percent of U.S. coal plants—209 out of 210—it would be cheaper to replace energy with new wind and solar than to keep them operating, a 2023 Energy Innovation analysis found.

The Sierra Club has led the charge to close power plants in the U.S. through their decades-long “Beyond Coal” campaign. The new coal funding is “just the latest Trump administration action that harms people and the planet,” Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News.

“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.

Trump’s emergency orders to keep operating multiple coal plants slated for retirement have cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone.

A 90-day emergency order requiring continued operation of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan has generated an additional $80 million in costs since May. The company has said that it will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest, in accordance with the cost-collection process set by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Trump has repeatedly argued that coal is critical to improving the reliability of the American energy grid amid surging power demand. But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.

Between 2013 and 2024, forced-outage rates (excluding planned outages for maintenance) for coal exceeded those for other major sources of electricity, including gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power, according to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Most coal plants in the U.S. were built before 1990. Keeping those plants running as they age requires more and more money, leading utilities to schedule retirement dates for nearly half of all plants.

Solomon uses the analogy of car ownership to explain the decline of coal energy in the U.S. “If you have a car that has 250,000 miles on it, very little is going to bring that car back to new,” she said. “You can only do so much when the infrastructure is that old.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1240947794-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:22.657156

“This project represents another important investment in the cleaner, more efficient future we’re building across Bendix,” said Luis Quiñones, Bendix environmental and sustainability engineer. “It reflects our continued commitment to renewable energy, to our community, and to doing what’s right for the environment.”

By utilizing solar power, the BDC will avoid about 1,145 tons of CO₂ emissions each year, reducing the company’s dependence on the regional power grid, lowering site energy costs, stabilizing energy expenses, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The solar panels cover pollinator-friendly vegetation that attracts bees, butterflies, and other species, all while enriching the soil and aiding stormwater absorption.

The site includes a one-for-one replacement commitment for any trees cut down during construction.

“Integrating biodiversity into industrial projects is one of the most meaningful ways we can multiply our positive impact,” said Quiñones. “This installation doesn’t just generate power – it regenerates the land it sits on.”

With more than 400 employees, Huntington is home to one of Bendix’s largest manufacturing, assembly, and distribution sites – and one of its greenest.

“This project shows what’s possible when engineering and environmental stewardship work hand in hand,” said Quiñones. “It’s a model we’re proud to keep moving forward.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/11/Bendix-Huntington-Solar-2025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:45.704630

Denver-based Vantage Data Centers on Thursday announced it has partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the Lighthouse data center campus in Port Washington.

In October, Vantage revealed that Oracle and OpenAI were the investors for an artificial intelligence data center campus west of Interstate 43, which will have four data center buildings built on 500 acres and use more than a gigawatt of electricity. Through LLCs, Vantage bought around 2,000 acres of farmland north of the city of Port Washington.

Oracle and OpenAI partnered to invest $500 billion and add 10 gigawatts of capacity to AI-focused data centers across the country.

The partnership with WBTC will require a “peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over a three-year period,” Vantage officials said. The developer will rely on local union labor “to the fullest extent possible,” they added. Further details of the deal weren’t shared.

Vantage officials said construction will begin “very soon” and is expected to be completed in 2028. In addition to 4,000 construction jobs, officials said the facility will create more than 1,000 long-term jobs.

“This pledge recognizes the importance of building complex digital infrastructure with the best skilled professionals who deliver projects safely, on time and to the highest quality standards,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in a statement. “We are excited to start working on this project, which represents a historic opportunity for Wisconsin workers to complete apprenticeships, support their families and invest in their communities.”

“Wisconsin has one of the most skilled and highly trained workforces in the country, and agreements like this prove it,” said Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, in a statement. “Every job created here means another opportunity for our local tradespeople to showcase their expertise and build careers right at home. When we invest in Wisconsin workers, we invest in Wisconsin’s future.”

“Vantage is proud to partner with Wisconsin’s union workers to build a once-in-a-generation, sustainable data center campus in Port Washington. We look forward to collaborating with local officials, the community and the Governor to break ground on this project with union support,” said Simon Casey, chief delivery officer of North America at Vantage Data Centers in a statement. “This is part of our ongoing commitment to the local economy and community, all while positioning Wisconsin as a leader in sustainable digital infrastructure.”

Vantage Data Centers officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company will invest $175 million in infrastructure improvements in the facility area, including new water and sewer systems, and Port Washington will reimburse the company through a proposed tax incremental financing district.

The city council is scheduled to meet Nov. 4 to review the district plan, which will need final approval from the Joint Review Board. The board will likely meet later in November.

Vantage operates 39 data center campuses across five continents, according to its website.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect.
Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.
Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.
“Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling.","After meeting in August to hear arguments on updates to how the state permits large-scale animal feeding operations, Phil Roos, the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued his final opinion Wednesday, laying out new terms for how the state permits livestock facilities.

Clean water advocates have applauded the new requirements, while agricultural industry representatives have begun exploring legal options to challenge Roose’s decision.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect. EGLE is required to issue new permits every five years, leaving the state to operate under the conditions of its 2015 permit for the past decade.

According to a 2024 report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which argued in favor of stricter permit requirements, the 290 confined animal feeding operations in the state produce 62.7 million pounds of waste daily, with many dairy and hog farms storing liquid waste in lagoons, which third parties apply to crop fields as fertilizer.

This waste can carry contaminants like E.Coli, phosphorus and nitrates, leading to harmful algal blooms in nearby waterways and polluting nearby drinking water.

In his decision, Roos agreed with EGLE attorneys’ recommendations to reinstate a ban spreading animal waste on snow-covered ground that was previously stripped from the permit by an administrative law judge. Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.

The judge’s decision to remove this provision was not based on science or the department’s mandate to ensure compliance with water quality standards, but rather “convenience to farmers,” Roos said.

Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.

Roos’ determination also permits EGLE to impose site-specific regulations for industrial feeding operations in watersheds that do not meet the state’s water quality standards, and individualized ground water monitoring requirements.

He also modified the 2020 permit’s date of issuance for the permit to expire five years from his Oct. 29, 2025 final decision.

While the decision did not adopt every recommendation put forth by EGLE and the many environmental advocacy groups who sought tighter protections, the decision was hailed by many of the intervenors as a step in the right direction for water quality.

“The legal and administrative challenges to this commonsense permit have wasted five years, during which [these feeding operations] were allowed to keep polluting Michigan’s waters,” Katie Garvey, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling. EGLE must now take swift action to implement the new [concentrated animal feeding operation] water permit.”

Megan Tinsley, the water policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council similarly called for a quick implementation of the permit’s new provisions, noting that more rivers and streams are impaired each year while water bodies cannot be used for their designated uses, like swimming.

“Our waters inspired the motto ‘Pure Michigan’ and support a $13.9 billion outdoor recreation economy,” Tinsley said. “EGLE must quickly implement the provisions in this long-overdue permit to prevent further degradation.”

However, the Michigan Farm Bureau, which has led the opposition to the permit changes, is already examining their legal options.

In an article published by Michigan Farm News, an official publication of the bureau, Laura Campbell, the group’s senior conservation and regulatory relations specialist, said Roos’s decisions would hinder farmers’ ability to provide nutrients and meet crop needs, while placing them under complex new requirements that will incur additional costs.

Both Campbell and Allison Eicher, assistant general counsel for the group, said Michigan Farm Bureau would be meeting with other industry groups and farmers to determine their next steps, with Campbell noting an appeal of the decision could be in the cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-170046503-700x383-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:25.525394

Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given.
Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control.
The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?
They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.","Here’s what things look like now, but a lot could change.

We’re now one year from Election Day. Because of polarization, environmental policy is closely tied to political party. The outcome of the election will shape environmental policy. If the Republicans maintain control of Congress, Trump will be relatively unchecked. Democratic control of the House or the Senate would prevent further rollbacks from Congress and would put the brakes on some of Trump’s anti-environmental efforts.

My observations are based on two well-established political websites, Cook and Sabato. Given all that’s happening, the situation will surely shift in the next year, but here’s what things look like right now.

Will the Democrats Take the Senate?

The “out-party” typically does well in off-year elections, but the Senate map is tough for the Democrats. Republicans currently hold 53 seats and the Vice-Presidency, so Democrats need to hold all of their current seats and pick up four more for control. Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given. Sabato and Cook both rate Michigan and Georgia as toss-ups at this point.

Picking up four new seats wouldn’t be easy. The best two shots are North Carolina and Maine (now considered toss-ups.). Ohio is next, rated by lean Republican by Cook and Sabato. After that, you’re into states that are rated “likely Republican”: Iowa and Texas. Democrats would have to carry one of those, and will need some strong tailwinds to do so.

However, even without flipping control, closing the gap in the Senate could still make a big difference. For instance, if the Democrats win North Carolina, Maine, and Ohio, then the Senate would be tied. Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control. But Lisa Murkowski would then be an essential vote for Republicans, and she’s a maverick who could play a role like Manchin did for Democrats under Biden.

Will the Democrats Win the House?

Gerrymandering will make a big different next November, since Republicans are trying to eliminate competitive seats in their states and Democrats are retaliating in their own states. Cook sees 17 and Sabato sees 18 toss-up House races. In Cook’s count, Democrats need to keep all their own toss-up seats and pick up 6 GOP seats to win control, Republicans only need to win only 2 toss-up races. Sabato sees 13 toss-ups, but fewer Democratic seats that category. This results in more of a level playing field, with Democrats needing to win 7 of the 12 toss-up races in seats currently held by Republicans, while Republicans only need 5. Either way, Republicans have at least a slight edge.

This edge is a tribute to the success of Republican gerrymandering in eliminating competitive districts. (I’m simplifying things – there are also a bunch of “Lean” districts, and wins in those districts would provide a cushion for either party in the toss-up races.) If Prop 50 passes in California, which is now expected, that would make the prospects more balanced between the parties.

The Democrats have two big advantages going into the race. The first is the long history of out-party success in off-year elections. The second is that turnout in those elections is lower than in presidential elections, and Democrats now have strong support from the affluent, educated voters who have the highest turnout. Trump won with the support of people who don’t usually vote but turned out for him. It may be hard to duplicate that when he’s not on the ballot.

Candidate quality will make a difference in these close races. But the biggest factor will be the nation’s political mood. Will Trump be seen as successful (even if some supporters don’t like him that much)? Or will there be a huge backlash? That may turn on the state of the economy as much as anything. The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?

What About the Statehouses?

Governors are important players in state climate policy. Sabato and Cook agree that the races in Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin are toss-ups; New Jersey leans or is likely Democratic, and both Kansas and Iowa lean Republican. Cook thinks Georgia and Nevada are toss-ups; Sabato thinks they lean Republican. They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.

I suspect that the outcomes will be driven partly by candidate quality and partly by whether there’s a national wave (although governor’s races seem slightly less nationalized than House race or Senate races).

Obviously, it’s early days. The Democrats will need to get some luster back on their brand and see some tarnishing of Trump’s if they’re to prevail. Otherwise, it will be more of the same in Congress until 2028.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Midterm2026-blog.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:18:47.710576

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.
In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state.","Michigan’s clean energy future has faced major setbacks, with companies scaling back projects and laying off workers due to federal policy changes and funding cuts made by President Donald Trump’s administration.

According to new reporting from Climate Power, a national public relations and advocacy organization dedicated to climate justice, 158,000 clean energy jobs across the country have been canceled or delayed since Trump entered his second term. Michigan accounts for over 6,000 of those jobs, including the 1,200 workers General Motors announced in late October would be laid off at an electric vehicle plant in Detroit.

“Donald Trump’s policies are singlehandedly engineering a collapse of manufacturing projects in Michigan,” Climate Power communications director Alex Glass said in a statement. “On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs and lower costs – instead, he’s leaving Americans with higher utility bills and pink slips. Michigan Republicans will have to answer to voters for why they’ve co-signed an agenda that is sending American manufacturing jobs overseas and making daily life unaffordable.”

Michigan has been aggressive in its push toward clean energy in recent years, even setting a goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2040. According to Climate Power, Michigan was the No. 1 state in the nation in 2024 in its number of clean energy projects: From 2022-2024, the state announced 74 projects totaling over 26,000 jobs and roughly $27 billion in federal funding.

That progress has been disrupted under Trump, who has long been critical of the country’s climate policies and the development of clean energy technology. He’s made false claims that climate change is a hoax and that wind turbines cause cancer. Since taking office again in January, Trump has unsuccessfully attempted to pause funding awarded to climate groups through President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and signed an executive order to boost coal production.

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.

Most recently, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in a press release on Oct. 17 that the state had joined officials of 22 other states in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for what they charge was their illegal ending of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion initiative aimed at lowering energy costs for low-income households.

In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state. The attorney general’s office says in the press release that the loss of federal funding has halted these projects and “denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.”

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”",https://michiganindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SolarPanelsDetroit_23109645366259.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:57.766323

Email address Thank you!

With the first month of sales reports coming in post-tax-credit, U.S. EV sales have taken an absolute drubbing. The highly publicized end of EV subsidies had the precise effect analysts predicted, encouraging sales in the final months of its availability (and likely leaving demand depressed for months to come). Even in cases where brands stepped in with their own incentives, the sales have essentially vanished, and as automakers flex away from electric models to ICE vehicles in the coming, we expect the segment to stay relatively cool.

Bear in mind that not all automakers report their sales figures monthly anymore, so we won’t have a clearer picture of what’s happening industry-wide until January (after Q4/full-year sales are announced). Here’s a preliminary look:

Hyundai – Ioniq 5 sales took an absolute beating, dropping more than 60% compared to a year ago. Total Ioniq 5 sales are still up nearly 25% for 2025, so it’s not all bad news there. Ioniq 6 sales were down 52% in October and remain down 4% for the year; worse than that, it was only moving in triple-digit monthly volumes to begin with. Hyundai’s sold fewer than 10,000 of the sedans this year. Hyundai sold nearly as many Ioniq 9s as it did Ioniq 6s, but that’s not saying a whole lot…

Kia – EV6 sales likewise dropped by two-thirds compared to last October, as did sales of the three-row EV9. EV6 sales have declined by a third in 2025 overall, going the opposite direction of the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Kia doesn’t break down Niro sales by powertrain, but the smaller crossover was up by 75% last month despite a lingering full-year sales deficit.

Honda – It should come as no surprise that the Prologue took it on the chin in October (down 80% to just over 800 units). That was still better than the (now dead) Acura ZDX, which recorded just 25 sales last month (down from 1,200 a year ago).

Subaru -It may surprise you to learn that Subaru was generally on pace to match its 2024 total of just over 10,000 Solterras sold in 2025, but that came to a screeching halt in October. Subaru sold just 13 of the EVs last month.

Short version: It’s a bloodbath. It likely won’t stay this ugly long-term, but we’re not expecting any big surprises from the segment any time soon. A lot of pent-up demand was just satisfied by EVs being discounted while the credit was still good, so even in cases where prices haven’t changed all that much, it stands to reason that the automakers were spending more to move metal while the feds were still picking up the tab for the discounts.

The end result may not have changed all that much for the customer, but a whole lot of potential profit evaporated overnight, and automakers would rather focus on selling models that won’t lose them money outright.

We’ll keep our eyes peeled for any other big news on the EV sales front; in the meantime, if you’re hunting for a leftover, your favorite brand might be in the mood to deal just to get it off the lot. Can’t hurt to try.

Synthetic graphite is essential not only for EV batteries, but also for semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems, and steel production.","Vianode, a Norwegian producer of advanced battery materials, announced that its first large-scale production facility for low-emission synthetic anode graphite will be developed in Ontario, Canada. Synthetic graphite is an essential component in lithium-ion batteries and is critical for a range of defence and industrial applications. Vianode’s production facility was featured as part of Canada’s leadership in the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance and will contribute to the diversification of resilient, domestic supply chains that use this critical mineral.

The project is structured as a phased, multi‑billion‑dollar investment, starting with an initial investment of over CAD 2 billion. Over time, planned expansions will bring total capacity to as much as 150,000 tons annually, supporting a secure North American supply chain for critical minerals that power strategic industries.

“North American supply chains are heavily reliant on graphite sourced from China for lithium-ion batteries, defence technologies, nuclear technology and more. A large-scale facility in Ontario delivering high-performance anode graphite solutions will provide Canada with domestic capacity that will make supply chains more resilient. This scalable project is a key building block that aligns with recent shifts in trade policy and supports our ambition to be a leading and trusted supplier for G7 supply chains,” says Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode.

“Canada is proud to support Vianode in advancing critical mineral development that aligns with our national priorities and international commitments, and proud they chose Canada for North America’s first large-scale low-emission synthetic graphite production facility. Through the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are working with trusted partners to deploy sovereign tools, mobilize investments and financing, and secure offtake arrangements to accelerate the development of secure, resilient critical minerals supply chains. These minerals will power the clean energy transition, strengthen our defence and manufacturing capabilities, and position Canada as a trusted supplier to our allies,” says the Honourable Tim Hogdson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

“Canada’s support for Vianode reflects our commitment to responsible resource development and international collaboration. By advancing projects that align with the goals of the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are helping to build resilient supply chains, drive innovation, and bolster Canada’s position as a trusted global partner in the continued development of more clean energy and advanced manufacturing,” adds Claude Guay, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

Synthetic graphite is essential not only for EV batteries, but also for semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems, and steel production. As demand accelerates globally, supply chain security is a pressing issue.

Vianode’s planned facility will establish a resilient and sustainable battery supply chain in North America and enhance the region’s access to strategic materials, in addition to creating around 300 highly skilled jobs in the initial phase and up to 1000 at full capacity.

Ontario was chosen after an extensive selection and due diligence process. A front-end engineering design (FEED) study has been conducted, and ground preparation works are under way to enable start of production in 2028.

“Canada and Vianode are a perfect match. Ontario is home to major manufacturing hubs, with access to world-class infrastructure and a low-carbon electricity grid. The province has all the characteristics we are looking for. During our North American selection process, I have seen first-hand a strong shared commitment to closing the strategic gaps in the critical minerals supply chain and creating jobs that will strengthen Canada’s economic resilience,” says Emanuele Tricca, Vianode’s Managing Director in Canada.

Vianode has produced synthetic anode graphite at its industrial pilot facility in Kristiansand, Norway since 2021, and in 2024, the company started operations at the world’s most sustainable synthetic anode graphite plant Via ONE at Herøya, Norway. Vianode recently launched the first high-performance anode graphite solution based on recycled materials, as part of its next-generation material series.

The agency posted changes on the individual websites of the Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Land and Emergency Management.

In an email, spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the changes “will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,” a reference to the administration’s slogan for its EPA agenda.

The agency, meanwhile, “continues to work through the reorganization process for the remaining program offices and will provide updates as they become available,” Hirsch added.

She didn’t respond to followup requests for more detail on the reorganization’s expected benefits and whether employee layoffs — technically known as reductions in force — will accompany any of the three reorganizations.

POLITICO’s E&E News reported last week that EPA was poised to unveil new structures for the air and solid waste offices. The potential impact of the enforcement office makeover left one retired agency official scratching his head.

“It doesn’t look like it did anything dramatic, but it’s hard to tell without more detail,” Larry Starfield, who served as the enforcement office’s principal deputy assistant administrator, said in an interview.

A new organizational chart for the land office shows a pared-down Office of Land and Emergency Management, down from 10 suboffices to five. The Superfund, federal facilities and emergency response offices have been condensed into one — the Office of Superfund and Emergency Management — and gone are the stand-alone offices dedicated to communications, management and staffing.

OLEM’s other flagship programs, including Brownfield grants, resource conservation and regulating underground storage tanks, saw few changes to their organizational structures. While Trump administration officials have voiced intentions to expedite hazardous waste cleanups with fewer resources, it is still not clear how the redesign will impact daily functions.

For the air office, however, the changes loom as the most significant since implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

Gone are the Office of Atmospheric Protection, which handled most of EPA’s climate work, and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), which set national limits for smog, soot and other common pollutants and write regulations for power plants and other industries.

To varying degrees, the standards office’s responsibilities will now be divvied out among the newly created Office of Clean Air Programs and the Office of State Air Partnerships.

“Overall, I can’t say this is a bad thing for OAQPS as the functions all still seem to be there,” Chet Wayland, a retired senior air manager, told E&E News in a text message after reviewing the new structure. “But the reality of what each of those branches gets tasked to actually work on will be interesting.”

Wayland saw no evidence of greenhouse gas or climate initiatives surviving in the new structure.

Meanwhile, Energy Star, the energy efficiency rating program for appliances, has been moved from the now defunct Office of Atmospheric Protection to the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air.

What’s next for Energy Star?

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plan to abolish Energy Star provoked opposition from both industry and environmentalists. The New York Times on Saturday reported that Zeldin is reconsidering. But Hirsch said Monday that “no final decision has been made at this time.”

It’s unclear how much economic activity is generated by Energy Star, as it “does not preclude the purchase or sales of any product,” Hirsch said.

“The Trump EPA is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and a program that essentially is a government-sponsored advertising scheme doesn’t seem like a good use of hard-working Americans’ money,” she said.

Two people familiar with internal operations said the fate of the program remains uncertain.

“I think [EPA] realized it’s a little more complicated … given how many industries use it,” said a person granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on internal deliberations.

“It doesn’t seem like they’ve made any decision,” the person said.

Unlike the Department of Energy’s mandatory efficiency rules, Energy Star is voluntary. EPA sets standards that businesses can choose to meet and verify independently before displaying the program’s blue label on appliances, buildings and homes.

Energy Start supporters say federal data shows that the program saves consumers and businesses more than $40 billion a year — an amount higher than its annual appropriations.

More than 1,000 companies, cities and organizations sent a letter to EPA in April urging support for Energy Star, which they called “among the most successful public-private partnerships in U.S. history.”

Zeldin has called for privatizing the program, telling lawmakers in May it requires “a big taxpayer-funded staff.”

The restructurings unveiled Monday arrived about two weeks after EPA announced comparable reorganizations of its chemical safety and research wings. Throughout the process, agency leaders have provided little information on staffing or the potential effects on the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The restructurings are all part of an agencywide retrenchment that Zeldin announced this spring in the course of a downsizing drive predicted to save more than $300 million this fiscal year and cut EPA’s workforce to levels close to those found during the Reagan administration.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b4/aa/8513fcea441ba7747d29070ee854/epa-17823.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:32.972127

On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035.
As for climate resilience, the 2021 ""Glasgow pledge"" to double adaptation finance expires this year, and countries must decide on a new goal at COP30.
This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.","While the impacts of climate change are becoming ever-clearer, so too are the benefits of action.

The shift toward technologies like renewable energy and electric vehicles is already cleaning the air and preventing deaths from pollution. Countries investing in greener development models are creating millions of new jobs in areas like power and manufacturing. Clean energy is lowering electricity costs and bringing power to those without.

Yet this transition is not happening nearly fast enough to prevent increasingly dangerous climate impacts, and progress remains uneven. As some countries forge ahead on low-carbon development, others are pulling back. Meanwhile, the cost of climate change continues to rise: Extreme weather caused over $300 billion in damages last year alone.

What we need now is a step change. The world must move from setting targets to delivering them. The upcoming UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil is a prime opportunity to do so.

WRI experts have laid out four key areas where COP30 can put the world on track for a safer, more prosperous future:

Deliver robust national climate commitments, using detailed global and country plans to close the gap in climate action.

Transform the global financial system so that all forms of finance (public and private, domestic and international) support the transition to green, inclusive, resilient economies. Ensure that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.

Step up climate resilience by recognizing that investing in adaptation means investing in growth, security and development; by delivering an ambitious new adaptation finance goal; and by setting clear, measurable indicators for tracking progress.

Protect nature, reform food systems and advance Indigenous land rights: three key elements for tackling the interconnected climate and nature crises together.

So, what must COP30 achieve in these areas and beyond to be considered a success? Here's what our experts are looking for:

Right now, we face many headwinds for climate action and multilateralism. The U.S. has stepped back, and there are similar discussions of slowing down in parts of Europe. But that's not the whole story. Across the 50 countries WRI works in, what we see on the ground is that progress is happening.

All of the leaders I speak to from developing countries see this transition as their best economic opportunity, not as a burden. This is especially true in large middle-income countries. China and India are driving record renewable deployment, especially solar. Economic growth driven by clean energy is now even more of a motivator than climate. As COP host, Brazil is also showing how an economy rooted in forest protection, rather than destruction, can create over $8 billion in additional GDP and more than 300,000 new jobs in the Amazon region by 2050. For these countries, economic prosperity, energy security and decarbonization are essentially the same thing, driving the momentum we're seeing today.

There's a geopolitical realignment of climate leadership taking place. These middle-income countries played a key role in shaping the outcome [at COP29 in 2024] in Baku. With their large populations, substantial emissions and significant stores of biodiversity, they will continue to play an outsized role in determining the success of the global transition for people, nature and climate. We are watching closely to see what form their leadership will take at COP30.

Accelerate Action on National Climate Commitments, Finance and Adaptation

Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Director, WRI

All countries are due to deliver new national climate plans (known as ""nationally determined contributions,"" or ""NDCs"") this year. Sixty-five countries had formally submitted NDCs as of Oct. 27 — and the current plans fall far short of what's needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. Several major emitters are still expected to put forward plans ahead of or during COP30, which could help. But a substantial gap remains.

In Belém, leaders must agree on a decisive global response to address this shortfall. This includes: 1) reaffirming the 1.5 degree C goal and developing an ""Ambition Framework"" which sets out how to close the gap to achieve it; 2) accelerating sector-specific strategies to cut emissions from areas like energy and transport before 2030, reflecting the outcomes of the 2023 Global Stocktake on climate action; and 3) clarifying pathways to achieve countries' net-zero goals, particularly through updated long-term strategies.

On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035. The forthcoming Baku-to-Belém Roadmap will lay out pragmatic strategies to achieve this goal, showing how countries can get all sources working together as a system to deliver finance for the transition at scale. At COP30, countries must demonstrate how they will turn this plan into action. One promising development to look for is the unveiling of ""country platforms"": various country-led approaches that aim to align all sources of finance behind countries' climate and development plans, policy reforms and investment pipelines.

As for climate resilience, the 2021 ""Glasgow pledge"" to double adaptation finance expires this year, and countries must decide on a new goal at COP30. Some developing countries are calling for a needs-based target while others are calling to triple adaptation finance by 2030. Our own forthcoming analysis shows that a tripling is achievable by 2035, but it would take increases across all sources (including multilateral development banks' funds for the poorest, bilateral funds, new sources of concessional finance, and more private finance being mobilized), and finance working better as a system.

COP30 also offers an opportunity to adopt a set of progress indicators under the Global Goal on Adaptation. This will create a common language to track resilience-building efforts and the support needed. Done right, this can help put resilience at the heart of countries', communities' and corporates' core economic, development and business planning.

Strengthen Pledges that Align Action on Climate and Nature

Mariana Oliveira, Director of Forests and Land Use, WRI Brasil

We won't meet our climate goals — not on mitigation, not on adaptation — if forests and ecosystems aren't part of the plan. The science is clear that protecting and restoring nature and transforming food systems are powerful tools to cut emissions, build resilience and reduce climate impacts. The challenge? Mobilizing the resources to scale these solutions.

One initiative to watch at COP30 is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that will be launched by the Brazilian government. This bold proposal offers predictable, performance-based payments to countries that keep their forests standing, moving away from dependence on philanthropy. Brazil has already pledged $1 billion to the fund, and other countries, such as the U.K., Colombia, Norway and Indonesia, have expressed their support for it. But for the TFFF to work, it needs at least $25 billion to be announced during COP. Whether developed countries will step up is a key question.

Countries should also deliver a strong package to bolster Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' land tenure rights and increase funding to them. While these communities are some of the world's most effective forest stewards, their territories are under constant and increasing threats, and many lack legal rights to the lands they manage. COP30 can help by delivering an improved Forest Tenure Pledge 2.0 and ensuring that Indigenous Peoples and local communities receive at least 20% of funding from the TFFF.

Equally essential is unlocking investments in sustainable agriculture and land restoration. One development to watch is the launch of the RAIZ (Resilient Agriculture Investment for Net-Zero Land Degradation) initiative. This proposes innovative financial mechanisms to fund the restoration of up to 250 million hectares of degraded land by 2050 — while at the same time increasing global food production.

Alongside RAIZ, complementary initiatives already underway in Brazil (such as the National Productive Forests Program and the Action Plan for Deforestation Prevention and Control in the Amazon) underscore the country's emerging leadership in integrating action on climate, nature and food systems. Advancing this cohesive agenda more broadly can help ensure that COP30 delivers not only on climate ambition, but also on resilience, equity and shared prosperity.

Under Brazil's Leadership, Make This the 'COP of Implementation'

Karen Silverwood-Cope, Climate Director, WRI Brasil

In its role as COP president, Brazil is bringing a clear and ambitious vision to COP30: to make Belém the ""COP of Implementation."" The Presidency's central challenge is to turn promises into real-world action — bridging divides between developed and developing countries, ambition and equity, mitigation and adaptation. The Brazilian Presidency has outlined three priorities that began to be articulated and implemented in 2024 and will culminate in Brazil's COP Presidency by the end of 2026.

First, Brazil has been working to align climate and economic priorities over the last year through convenings like the G20 and BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa] summit, putting finance at the heart of international climate talks. Brazil also launched the COP30 Circle of Finance Ministers, bringing together representatives from 37 countries who developed concrete recommendations on concessional finance, multilateral bank reform, country investment platforms and regulatory frameworks to unlock capital flows. This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.

Second, Brazil is redefining regional leadership, rooted in cooperation between emerging economies. For example, the Rio Declaration at the recent BRICS summit signaled a readiness among emerging economies to lead a resilient, low-carbon transition — from green bonds and tropical forest protection to new trade and carbon accounting initiatives.

Finally, Brazil's presidency is working to weave together the broader web of actors that drive progress outside of formal COP negotiations. It aims to deliver an ""Action Agenda"" that can better align all actors behind various climate commitments and processes (like the Global Stocktake, NDCs and long-term strategies), promoting transparency and accountability in climate action.

Other key deliverables to watch for at COP30 under Brazil's leadership include progress on the Just Transition Work Programme and the Gender Action Plan and the development of indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation.

“This technology is the best way to move forward in the clean energy transition and reduce peak load demands on the grid.” News item from Clean Energy For Maryland","Environmental and consumer advocates are asking the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) to lower Marylanders’ electricity bills by rapidly acquiring new, low-cost clean energy and storage as authorized by the Next Generation Energy Act, which the legislature passed with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore in April.

The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Center for Progressive Reform, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Earthjustice, Elders Climate Action Maryland, Environment Maryland Research and Policy Center, Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Maryland PIRG Foundation sent a letter encouraging the PSC to move quickly to acquire storage and to prioritize storage connected to solar energy projects.

“The Next Generation Energy Act wisely requires the state to expand energy storage capacity and renewable buildout and we encourage the legislature, Gov. Moore and Maryland Public Service Commission to move quickly to deploy clean energy to drive down rising electricity prices,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club.

It helps utilities meet peak demand, potentially replacing expensive and polluting “peaker plants.” When paired with solar power and other clean energy, energy storage allows the grid to maximize clean energy potential and reduce pollution from fossil fuel power plants.

The Next Generation Energy Act requires the PSC to solicit proposals for up to 1,600 MW of energy storage capacity, with an initial proposal deadline of January 1, 2026. In comparison, the Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant outside of Baltimore has a generating capacity of 1,289 MW.

Approving clean energy and storage projects ahead of the January deadline will enable Maryland to benefit from expiring federal tax credits and help drive electricity prices down. In light of expiring tax credits, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine and Oregon have moved to expedite similar processes and Maryland advocates are calling for the state to follow suit.

“Pairing battery storage with solar power is a win-win for energy customers and the planet,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director for Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “This technology is the best way to move forward in the clean energy transition and reduce peak load demands on the grid.”

The parties argue the partnership is in accordance with the President’s May 23, 2025 Executive Orders, which were meant to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years. At the center of the new strategic partnership, at least $80 billion of new reactors are targeted to be constructed across the United States using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology.

“Our administration is focused on ensuring the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced nuclear technologies,” said Howard Lutnick, Secretary for the United States Department of Commerce. “This historic partnership supports our national security objectives and enhances our critical infrastructure. Together with Westinghouse we will unleash American energy. This partnership embodies the bold vision of President Trump – to rebuild our energy sovereignty, create high-paying jobs, and drive America to the forefront of the nuclear renaissance.”

The parties also maintain that the partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the American nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain. Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs, Westinghouse said. As part of the partnership, at least $80 billion of nuclear reactors will be constructed using Westinghouse technology.

“Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. Government,” said Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco. “We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world. As a strategic partner, Cameco is a secure and reliable western-based supplier of the uranium fuel needed to support the civilian deployment and long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the U.S. and globally.”

The partnership also contains profit sharing mechanisms that provide for all parties once certain thresholds are met.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, President Trumps’ recent executive orders granted the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

According to a report by S&P Global, datacenter grid power demand is expected to rise 22% in 2025 alone and nearly triple by 2030. After decades of relatively flat electricity usage in the United States, datacenters are expected to draw vast amounts of power, creating demand strain on the grid.

“When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy, Meta.

The two Louisiana projects are expected to generate over $100 million in lifetime state and local tax revenue and create jobs in rural areas during project construction. About 300 jobs are expected to be created during peak construction.

The program, which has had bipartisan support for more than three decades, was targeted by Trump as part of his reckless and revenge-driven war on clean energy.

“Donald Trump promised to lower costs – and instead, his energy policy is sending costs through the roof and making appliances more expensive. It’s no wonder his policies are also deeply unpopular with everyone from business leaders to fellow Republicans. Eliminating this program will suck money out of Americans’ wallets and create even more uncertainty for businesses already reeling from Trump’s tariffs,” said Climate Power senior advisor Alex Witt. “American families are already struggling to pay their bills – and instead of offering relief, Trump is trying to do everything he can to make life even more expensive.”

The New York Times: E.P.A. Retreats From Plans to End the Energy Star Program

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has quietly retreated from plans to eliminate Energy Star, a popular program whose iconic blue labels help consumers to choose energy efficient dishwashers, refrigerators and other home appliances.

In a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Shortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in email that “no final decision has been made at this time” on whether to keep Energy Star…

“It is unclear what the economic activity generated by the Energy Star program is versus what the economic activity would be without this program,” Ms. Hirsch said, adding that “the Trump E.P.A. is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Since its creation in 1992, Energy Star has helped households and businesses save more than $40 billion annually in energy bills, according to a 2023 federal report. The E.P.A. has spent a fraction of that amount — about $32 million — to run the program each year.

Mr. Zeldin is weighing options for keeping Energy Star in some form, although a final decision has not been made and could be delayed by the government shutdown, said the four people briefed on the matter.

One option is transferring staff and funding for Energy Star to the Energy Department, which already plays a small role in running the program, the people said. Another is requiring appliance manufacturers to pay fees that would help cover the cost of the initiative.

Either choice would represent an unusual reversal for the E.P.A. In their zeal to terminate what President Trump has called the “green new scam,” agency officials have scrapped several other policies that even their allies in the oil, automotive and utility industries were not clamoring to reverse.

Regardless of what Mr. Zeldin decides, many E.P.A. employees who work on Energy Star have quit, retired or taken a buyout package since Mr. Trump took office. Other workers in the program have been furloughed as part of the government shutdown or reassigned as part of an agencywide reorganization…

“Energy Star is a hugely successful, voluntary program and the Energy Star logo is probably one of the most well-known logos in the country, if not the world,” said Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group.

But for years, Mr. Trump has railed against efficiency standards for home appliances, saying in April that more efficient shower heads did not spray enough water on his “beautiful hair.” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, has also pushed the E.P.A. to slash what he sees as wasteful green spending.

Yet on Capitol Hill, Energy Star has attracted rare bipartisan support, with lawmakers in both parties saying the program lowers energy costs at a time of rising electricity prices nationwide.

“I know that my constituents like knowing what the energy usage is of a particular appliance so that they can factor that into their buying decisions,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told CNN in May.

Ms. Collins declined to comment on Energy Star when asked by a reporter on Wednesday. In July, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees bucked Mr. Trump by proposing to provide level funding for the program for the next fiscal year.

The wrangling over Energy Star’s fate began in early May, when E.P.A. managers announced during an internal staff meeting that the program would grind to a halt.

“The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,” a manager told employees during the meeting, according to a recording of the remarks reviewed by The New York Times.

During a congressional hearing two weeks later, Mr. Zeldin claimed that Energy Star was “not a statutory obligation set by Congress” and that “this program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government.” In fact, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the E.P.A. and the Energy Department to run the program. (The E.P.A. officials who helped Mr. Zeldin prepare for the hearing were not aware of this mandate, according to two people familiar with the matter.)

The pushback was swift and intense.

The following month, in June, a coalition of industry groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that they would “strongly support continuation” of the program. The groups represented a range of businesses, including appliance manufacturers, chemical companies, home builders, retail stores and even bakery owners and hot tub distributors.

Appliance manufacturers and retail stores in particular like Energy Star because it helps sales. Around 90 percent of Americans recognize the program’s logo and many see it as a trustworthy way to identify efficient products, surveys have shown.

“We’re very supportive of the program remaining in the federal government,” said Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, one of the groups that signed the letter…",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:04:01.454672

The partnership between the departments of Defense and Commerce and Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies seeks to enable 10,000 metric tons of magnet production in the U.S. each year.

Vulcan Elements said in a press release it will be able to build and operate a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S.

Company chief of staff Jonah Glick-Unterman told The Hill in an email that the magnets in question can be used for virtually all electronic devices: satellites, robotics, drones, electric motors, hard disk drives and nearly all defense systems.

Under the deal, the military will provide Vulcan Elements with a $620 million loan from its Office of Strategic Capital, while an additional $50 million will come from the Department of Commerce under the CHIPS and Science Act.

The Office of Strategic Capital will also give ReElement Technologies an $80 billion loan to expand its recycling and processing operation.

The press release states the Commerce Department will get $50 million worth of equity in Vulcan Elements while the Pentagon will get “warrants” in both Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies.

Stock warrants would give the government the right to purchase a stock at a certain price. It’s not entirely clear how big a stake in the companies the government will seek to take, and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to questions from The Hill.

The Trump administration has been focused on shoring up its supplies of minerals and particularly rare-earth elements, seeking to use them in military applications in particular.

It has also sought to take a share of several companies it provides funding to, including in the minerals sector.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a written statement.

“We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable,” he added.

The magnets in question are neodymium iron boron magnets, with neodymium considered to be a rare-earth element. Such minerals are not necessarily rare, but are often found in small deposits on the Earth’s surface and can therefore be uneconomic to mine.

For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making.","In principle, there is a long-standing and broad bipartisan consensus in favor of robust ex-post evaluation of federal environmental policy. Proponents of ex-post evaluation note its many possible benefits—these include identifying (and eliminating) ineffective programs; improving the quality of ex-ante analysis; and facilitating regulatory experimentation. In reality, a number of political, institutional, and cultural barriers have blocked the emergence of any consistent practice of ex-post review. These barriers have persisted for decades, through administrations of both political parties and during periods of both united and divided government. They arise from consistent features of the administrative state, rather than the temporary politics of any particular moment. Overcoming them will likely require sustained reforms efforts.

Based in part on a series of interviews with senior government officials with decades of experience in environmental policymaking, this report identifies a set of ten interrelated barriers that have inhibited the development of a robust practice of environmental policy evaluation at federal agencies. These barriers are partially the result of political dynamics, but they also arise from agency institutional constraints, incentives, and cultures. Our research identifies the following leading barriers to ex-post evaluation:

Many agencies lack dedicated funding to carry out ex-post evaluation.

Agencies have highly constrained agenda space, making it difficult to prioritize ex-post evaluation.

Agencies face adverse political incentives to engage in self-scrutiny that may open them to political attacks.

Although agency personnel often have essential domain knowledge, they may lack the expertise to carry out rigorous ex-post analyses.

Agencies may lack (or believe they lack) legislative authority to carry out certain types of ex-post review.

It is often not clear how agencies should integrate the results of ex-post evaluation into decisionmaking, given that major regulatory decisions are rare.

The self-evaluations of agencies, even if carried out in good faith, may not be perceived as trustworthy by relevant stakeholders.

Ex-post evaluation often raises difficult questions of causal inference that agencies may be ill-positioned to address.

It is often difficult for agencies to collect the data needed to engage in ex-post evaluation.

Many agencies have not developed a culture of evaluation.

Given the identified barriers, we propose a suite of potential reforms for Congress to consider. These proposals are based on prior experience with ex-post review, analogous efforts within and outside the government, or suggestions that interviewees raised. We offer options at different levels of ambition, recognizing that enthusiasm to dedicate substantial congressional effort to the project of improving ex-post evaluation may vary. These levels of ambition can also be understood as scaling with time, so that more ambitious proposals, while perhaps unrealistic in the short term, may be more plausible over longer time horizons.

At the lowest level of ambition, Congress could use the appropriations process to direct funds to environmental policy evaluation. So as not to interfere with agency operations, and to avoid the impression that policy evaluation necessarily comes at the expense of programmatic goals, such funds should be made as additions to agency budgets, rather than as reallocations of existing resources. Appropriations directed to ex-post review would, most obviously, address the barrier of a lack of dedicated funds. Such appropriations would also require agencies to prioritize, to at least some degree, ex-post evaluation, regardless of their limited agenda space. Additional funding would also facilitate the acquisition of expertise as needed.

At a similar level of ambition, Congress could contemplate small-bore reforms that could ease the process of ex-post evaluation. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act places procedural and substantive limits on agencies’ ability to collect data—a core prerequisite of ex-post evaluation. Given limited agency resources and competing priorities, these burdens act as additional roadblocks that can sap momentum from evaluation efforts. Targeted reforms to the Paperwork Reduction Act could reduce these burdens while still ensuring that the core purposes of the Act are protected. Efforts to identify other similar facilitating reforms may be warranted.

At a higher level of ambition, Congress could create legal requirements for agencies to engage in policy evaluation, either of specific programs or more broadly. The most extensive ex-post analysis of environmental policy making that has been carried out to date was prompted by section 812 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In response to this congressional directive, the Environmental Protection Agency developed considerable expertise and dedicated significant resources to estimating the costs and benefits of air quality policies. Similar mandates could be effective, especially if coupled with additional funding and facilitating reforms. Legislative mandates would require agencies to devote at least some of their finite agenda space to ex-post evaluation, and, based on prior experience, would likely result in agencies accessing the expertise needed to carry out these evaluations in a rigorous fashion. Mandates would also clarify that agencies have authority to carry out ex-post evaluations.

A further measure at a similar level of ambition would be the creation of a specialized group of policy evaluation experts, within the Executive Office of the President, tasked with coordinating and facilitating ex-post evaluation efforts. Ideally, such a Policy Evaluation Group (PEG) would operate across a wide range of agencies (not only those with environmental portfolios), would be structured to be as politically neutral as possible, and would serve a supporting, rather than overseeing, role. The primary function of the PEG would be to provide human resources and expertise for agencies that are interested in engaging in policy evaluations. In this way, it would address issues of funding and expertise. A reform along these lines could also help increase the perceived trustworthiness of ex-post evaluations, given that outside experts would be part of the team that designed and implemented the analyses.

A more ambitious step that Congress could take would be the creation of a National Institute for Policy Evaluation and Review (NIPER), modeled on other scientific funding institutes. This new agency would fund collaborations between academic institutions and government agencies to engage in large-scale policy evaluations designed to identify and address key areas of uncertainty across a range of policymaking domains. Environmental policies would be one of several portfolios that could be overseen by a funding agency of this kind, which could also support research in areas such as education and criminal justice. A NIPER-like entity would have considerable potential to address most of the barriers to ex-post evaluation.

Finally, Congress could contemplate deeper statutory reforms designed to encourage agencies to integrate the results from ex-post evaluations into regulatory decisionmaking. Ex-post evaluations are only useful if they provide information that serves as an input into agency decisionmaking. However, the laborious rulemaking process, which includes litigation and the attendant risk of judicial invalidation of agency decisions, means that agencies are not well-poised to update rules based on new information. Recent moves by the US Supreme Court to reduce agency discretion has further constrained the ability of agencies to act on the information from ex-post evaluations. Congress may wish to contemplate legislation to ensure that the process of judicial review does not interfere unduly with flexible and responsive agency decisionmaking.

Reforms of some significant ambition are likely needed to address barriers that, for decades, have inhibited ex-post evaluation. But such reforms require considerable study and coalition building before they would become politically feasible. For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making. This new Commission would be charged with studying policy evaluation across the federal government, examining state and comparative analogies, and consulting with experts to generate a set of concrete recommendations for additional congressional action. The Commission would help generate the knowledge base necessary to support well-informed congressional action and could also act as a forum for bipartisan coalition building.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2447977967.width-600.png,N,,2025-11-03 19:04:54.330101

This story is republished as part of our partnership with Inside Climate News.

A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines, and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On October 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design.png,N,,2025-11-03 17:02:05.627399

Even as the politics are stalled, it is the economy and the hope of people everywhere that keep pulling change forward.",https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20251031_BID003.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:15.263106

“This project represents another important investment in the cleaner, more efficient future we’re building across Bendix,” said Luis Quiñones, Bendix environmental and sustainability engineer. “It reflects our continued commitment to renewable energy, to our community, and to doing what’s right for the environment.”

By utilizing solar power, the BDC will avoid about 1,145 tons of CO₂ emissions each year, reducing the company’s dependence on the regional power grid, lowering site energy costs, stabilizing energy expenses, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The solar panels cover pollinator-friendly vegetation that attracts bees, butterflies, and other species, all while enriching the soil and aiding stormwater absorption.

The site includes a one-for-one replacement commitment for any trees cut down during construction.

“Integrating biodiversity into industrial projects is one of the most meaningful ways we can multiply our positive impact,” said Quiñones. “This installation doesn’t just generate power – it regenerates the land it sits on.”

With more than 400 employees, Huntington is home to one of Bendix’s largest manufacturing, assembly, and distribution sites – and one of its greenest.

“This project shows what’s possible when engineering and environmental stewardship work hand in hand,” said Quiñones. “It’s a model we’re proud to keep moving forward.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/11/Bendix-Huntington-Solar-2025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:53.362516

She said locations may have to change if some of the 2024 awardees are no longer interested in hosting an EV charging station.
You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.
He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.
Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.","The state is moving forward with its plans to place electric vehicle chargers along Indiana's interstates. The Indiana Department of Transportation paused the federally-funded program in February while awaiting new guidance from the Trump administration.

The goal of the program is to reduce the fear that EV travelers will run out of battery life before reaching a charging station. The Trump administration originally sought to rescind funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, but changed course after facing lawsuits.

Among other things, the new guidance no longer requires chargers to be placed every 50 miles and within one mile of an interchange or major corridor.

Natalie Garrett with INDOT said this will help get chargers installed more quickly — potentially in places with less access. She said locations may have to change if some of the 2024 awardees are no longer interested in hosting an EV charging station.

""I think overall, improved flexibility is a benefit. You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.

Garrett said the process ""streamlined and simplified"" Indiana's plan. States also no longer have to address several things under the new guidance, including ""consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.""

David Konisky is a professor at the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington. He said the new guidance is not ideal, but getting more chargers on the road is the most important thing at this early stage — and the gaps in coverage could be filled in later.

""Right now across the United States and here in Indiana, they're just not enough of these fast chargers — what were called 'level three chargers' — to really facilitate the driving of electric vehicles, especially on long trips,"" Konisky said.

The guidance was also stripped of references to diversity initiatives. Indiana is no longer required to engage with minority and women-owned businesses or make sure chargers benefit disadvantaged communities.

Jorden Giger is the assistant director of project outreach for the nonprofit Black Sun Light Sustainability.

""There's going to have to be intentional organizing, you know, on the part of organizations like ours, minority business associations to be able to connect diverse businesses to the opportunities,"" he said.

Giger said 10 percent of the NEVI funding is set aside for technical assistance for states. He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.

The new guidance also encourages the chargers to be located ""at retail locations with onsite amenities that could provide safe locations and restrooms."" The Federal Highway Administration doesn't spell out what it means by ""safe locations.""

Denise Abdul-Rahman is Black Sun Light Sustainability's CEO and founder. She is also the state chair for environmental climate justice for the NAACP of Indiana.

""So just wondering what that will mean to make sure that communities that aren't invested in — and may be considered unsafe areas — can still benefit from these economic investments and all of the benefits that come with that,"" Abdul-Rahman said.

People looking to charge their EVs may spend money food or shopping while they wait for a charge. Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.

Garrett said INDOT is still going to take the public feedback it received about the Charging the Crossroads program into account as it moves forward.

Black Sun Light Sustainability will hold an event to connect INDOT with diverse contractors on Friday, Dec. 12 at The Nest Event Center in Indianapolis from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The Las Vegas Convention Center during Industry Week is typically alive with the roar of muscle cars and the smell of high-octane fuel, but Jeff noticed that the exhibit areas were instead filled with silent, humming displays of onboard diagnostics, telematics and computer-driven systems.

At one booth, a representative for a new in-car network — labeled a digital “nervous system” — proudly explained how its technology would restrict access to vehicle data, reserving it exclusively for licensed, factory-certified technicians.

A chill went down Jeff’s spine. This was about more than diagnostics; it was about locking independent service and repair shops out of the system entirely. A simple wrench, he realized, would no longer fix a software glitch. This wasn’t just a change in technology; it was a technological chokehold on his livelihood.

An Alliance of the Unlikely

Jeff remembered that one of his customers had been struggling with a recurring electrical issue in a new vehicle, a problem his scanners simply could not diagnose. He called a friend at the dealership, who sheepishly admitted the new diagnostic software was proprietary and not shared. Frustrated and at a dead end, Jeff posted his problem on LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube.

Eleanor Vance works for the Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation. For years, her job has involved drafting and enforcing rules for safety, emissions and fuel efficiency. But as she walked through the exhibits, she recognized that the data-driven revolution was more than making cars safer and greener — it was a power grab for control.

Eleanor was searching for examples of technological barriers hindering automotive shops while she toured the convention center exhibits. Her search led her to the same forum where Jeff had been. Intrigued, she sent him a private message introducing herself.

Jeff was skeptical but desperate enough to agree to a video call. Eleanor listened intently as Jeff explained his predicament. She explained her own concerns about the industry’s direction. An unlikely alliance between Jeff and Eleanor resulted, united by the need to preserve an open market.

The Regulator’s Revelation

Eleanor saw the booth presentations, watching as automakers built digital fences around their vehicles’ information. She spoke with a supplier whose frustration was obvious. The supplier complained that without access to proprietary codes, obtaining parts was almost impossible.

Coincidently, she overheard a conversation between Jeff and a younger technician — a moment that reinforced her growing concern. They discussed how independent technicians were losing business to dealerships because they could not access the same proprietary information.

Eleanor realized the government’s role had to evolve. Regulations designed for a world of replacement parts were now obsolete. She envisioned a future where independent shops like Jeff’s would become relics.

A monopoly on repair would mean higher costs and fewer choices for consumers. She began to formulate a plan to protect auto shops. Energized by the growing “Right to Repair” movement, she listened to a gathering of independent shops and repair advocates.

Their strategy was simple but spirited: focus on what AI could not yet do. They would specialize in the “ghosts in the machine” — the problems that were too complex or obscure to solve.

The Lawmaking Battle

Eleanor began drafting legislation, dubbed the “Automotive Data Access and Repair Act.” It was not an easy sell; lobbyists from major manufacturers began contacting her office. They argued that providing proprietary data would compromise safety and intellectual property, claiming independent shops were not prepared for complex repairs and that only factory-certified technicians could perform them.

Meanwhile, Jeff became the public face of a movement. He started a popular video series called “What the Code Won’t Tell You.” He highlighted the frustrating situations faced by independent shops. His simple and heartfelt videos gained a massive online following, showing a knowledgeable technician forced to turn away customers simply because of a digital lock. This grassroots support, fueled by frustrated consumers, provided Eleanor with the public pressure she needed.

The turning point came during a congressional hearing. Jeff testified about the problem, showing a video of a car that was towed to his shop. He then displayed the incomprehensible code from the vehicle’s onboard computer.

“This,” he said, holding up a small, worn-out wrench, “used to be the tool for understanding. Now, this is what we have.” He held up his generic scanner, which could only read surface-level problems. “The dealerships have the full book. We just have the cover.”

Jeff’s shop became a case study for the success of a new model. His team, now certified “AI-Assisted Technicians,” used artificial intelligence to analyze sensor data and predict part failures before they occurred, offering initiative-taking maintenance. They were no longer just fixing vehicles; they were preventing breakdowns from happening, building long-term relationships with customers.

The government’s role had shifted from a clumsy regulator to a nimble facilitator, fostering an environment where innovation and human ingenuity could coexist. Artificial Intelligence became a job-enhancer, not a job-killer, and the independent shop became more essential than ever.

Epilogue

Jeff’s shop flourished. With the new regulations, he was able to invest in advanced training and software, and his team became specialists in the very technologies that had once threatened to put him out of business. He even partnered with a local community college, creating a pipeline to train the next generation of technicians.

Takeaway:

This automotive service and repair tale is not a story of death but one of evolution and resilience. While the rise of EVs and computer driven systems presents significant challenges, it also creates new opportunities.

For savvy managers that embrace new technologies, diversify their services, and invest in their workforce, the future is still positive. Meanwhile, auto shops that do not adapt will face increasing pressure from market trends and competitors.

There is no single “Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation,” but the primary federal agencies that regulate the automotive industry are the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) setting Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Other relevant agencies include the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for commercial vehicles and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for consumer protection in auto sales.

This August, citing governmental “self-dealing and conflicts of interest,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin terminated the $7 billion “Solar for All” program, denying state environmental regulatory agencies funds that would have been used to install rooftop solar power systems in low-income communities. $156 million within this program had been allocated to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which had already initiated implementation plans.

Last week, North Carolina, along with 21 other states, sued the EPA for terminating the Solar for All program, arguing that the EPA did not have the authority to rescind these funds that had already been appropriated by Congress.

Zeldin’s vision of the EPA is of an agency that “will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars” dedicated to its “core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of ‘climate equity.’” Does the health of low-income communities and their environment not count? Trussed up in cost-cutting, corruption-culling rhetoric, the EPA’s choice is nothing more than a capitulation to the oil and gas industry.

Solar power is far from unprofitable. If Solar for All had been implemented, N.C. DEQ anticipated helping more than 12,000 households install solar panels, saving North Carolinians an average of $400 on monthly utility bills. The installation process would have created about 140 jobs, concentrated in rural parts of our state, which would encourage economic development.

But Solar for All wouldn’t just have saved money, it could have saved lives. According to N.C. DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, providing communities with solar power would improve North Carolina’s resiliency to natural disasters. Solar panels would give households and businesses access to independent power sources, so during catastrophes like Hurricane Helene, critical emergency services could be kept running if the main power grid fails. Not only would quotidian utility bills be cheaper, but in times of crisis, lives could be saved. Calling aid to North Carolinians' “frivolous climate equity spending” is more than plain mean — it violates the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The lawsuit against the EPA illustrates a broader struggle against federal attempts to appease corporate interests at the expense of Americans. In September, Zeldin announced the EPA’s plan to deregulate the fossil fuel industry in favor of “beautiful clean coal.” America is the fourth-largest global producer of coal. People depend on this industry for economic stability. But coal is finite, and the industry is in decline. Far from “clean,” coal is one of the dirtiest energy sources: It worsens climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, causes air pollution, creates coal ash contamination, produces acid rain and much more. The cost of cleaning up these externalities far outweighs the short-term profit of mining, but short-term profits seem to be the only thing with which Zeldin and the other 40 Trump administration picks with direct ties to the oil, gas and coal industries are concerned.

We will run out of coal. Transitioning our energy supply from finite resources like coal, oil and gas to infinitely renewable sources, like solar power, isn’t some uppity environmentalist principle — it’s an inevitability. “The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead,” wrote economistJohn Maynard Keynes, but even Keynes would agree that a bit of long-term planning is necessary for when we run out of the resource that powers society. The EPA’s choice to abandon the transition to renewable energy and instead deregulate and subsidize “beautiful clean coal” reflects short-term, profit-seeking nihilism that will only harm Americans — be it their pockets or their health — in the long-run.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/21604d47-6aba-4030-851b-8c60c67df408.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cedges&ar=16%3A9,N,,2025-11-03 15:20:35.705928

This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.
By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas.","When it comes to protecting taxpayers and ensuring people keep as much of their hard-earned money as possible, Texas usually leads the way. With no state income tax on individuals or corporations, investment is flocking to the Lone Star State and boosting industries throughout the state’s economy.

This November, Texas voters will decide on two pro-taxpayer ballot measures that would bolster the state’s reputation as the best place to do business in the country by prohibiting taxes on capital gains and financial transactions. Together, Propositions 2 and 6 will safeguard financial security, promote investment, and maintain a business-friendly climate that supports growth and innovation.

Proposition 2 would prohibit the state of Texas from imposing a tax on realized or unrealized capital gains of individuals, estates, and trusts. Capital gains taxes apply to profits from investments like stocks, real estate, or other assets. Since Texas does not currently levy a state-wide capital gains tax, Proposition 2 acts as a preventative measure that ties the hands of lawmakers who would try to raise taxes. This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.

Proposition 6 builds on this by banning taxes on securities transactions, like stock trades, and blocking occupation taxes on those working in the securities industry, including banks, brokers, and dealers. Like Proposition 2, it preemptively blocks tax hikes and creates certainty for investors and businesses, ensuring routine investment activity isn’t subject to unpredictable levies. Together, these measures create a stable tax environment that supports entrepreneurship and cements Texas’s reputation as a state that is open for business.

A quick survey of the state’s tax system illustrates why these two ballot measures are especially important for taxpayers. Texas relies primarily on sales and property taxes to fund government operations. Local governments, including school districts, counties, and cities, collect property taxes to pay for public services. By banning the imposition of capital gains and securities taxes in the future, Propositions 2 and 6 shield taxpayers from new financial burdens and prevent the gradual expansion of the state’s tax base.

A simple, predictable tax system is a cornerstone of a thriving economy. Businesses make decisions on where to expand their operations based on local tax climate, regulatory certainty, and the ability to reinvest profits without interference. By enshrining these safeguards into state law, Texas signals to entrepreneurs and investors alike that it values long-term capital formation and innovation. This ensures Texas maintains a competitive edge over other states that may be raising taxes or adopting more aggressive regulatory policies.

Other states’ missteps demonstrate why Propositions 2 and 6 are so important for taxpayers. Proposals for financial transaction taxes in New York and New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic alarmed investors and jeopardized retirement accounts, even prompting discussions about moving the Nasdaq stock exchange to another state. Although both states ultimately abandoned those taxes, the episode illustrates the harm spendthrift lawmakers can do without adequate legal constraints on their powers.

The planned Texas Stock Exchange, backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, illustrates how the state is increasingly becoming a major player in the financial sector to better compete with states like New York and Illinois. By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas. Moreover, preempting these taxes ensures that a Texas-based stock exchange can flourish, attracting both capital and financial talent to the state.

Financial firms have already begun fleeing jurisdictions with heavy-handed tax and regulatory policies for more welcoming destinations. From 2019 to 2023, nearly 160 Wall Street firms moved their headquarters out of New York, taking approximately $1 trillion in assets under management with them. Capital is highly mobile, and states must be careful to craft business climates that actually reward risk-taking and entrepreneurship rather than drive it away.

These measures also protect taxpayers by promoting sound governance. By taking the option of new taxes off the table, lawmakers will be incentivized to manage existing resources more prudently, rather than seeking additional revenue through new levies. This approach will, in turn, encourage more responsible spending and enhance predictability for households and businesses alike.

Texas voters should carefully weigh the long-term fiscal implications of Propositions 2 and 6. These measures are more than technical tax reforms, they are a thoughtful decision about the kind of economy Texas wants to foster. Should voters approve them, Texas will maintain a competitive edge over high-tax states like New York and California all while putting the interests of taxpayers first.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2019/10/texas-state-capitol-4066441-1920.jpg?v=20191028111800,N,,2025-11-03 20:59:46.485395

The plant, operated by eVAC Magnetics LLC, is designed to produce neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt permanent magnets. The facility received federal support through a $111.9 million Qualified Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit and a Defense Production Act Title III grant.

The project expands U.S. manufacturing capacity for rare-earth magnets. Asia, especially China, currently supplies most of the global market. The Sumter County site will employ about 300 full-time workers. It will begin commercial production in early 2026.

eVAC Magnetics is part of Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG (VAC Group), a Germany-based producer of magnetic materials with facilities in Europe. The South Carolina operation will serve industrial and defense markets in North America.

Supply of high-purity rare-earth oxides

On November 3, 2025, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. signed an agreement with VAC and eVAC Magnetics. The deal strengthens North America’s rare-earth supply chain. The companies will connect Ucore’s refining sites in Louisiana and Ontario with eVAC’s magnet plant in South Carolina. Ucore will supply high-purity rare-earth oxides. eVAC will use them to produce permanent magnets for industrial and defense markets.

The partnership builds a regional production network and reduces reliance on Asian imports. It supports demand from electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Executives say the plan creates one of the few closed-loop supply chains in North America.

Completion of the South Carolina facility adds momentum to U.S. efforts to expand critical-mineral production. Public and private investments continue to boost domestic refining and manufacturing capacity. Together, they reflect the nation’s shift toward electrification and cleaner energy technologies.

The platform’s NDC Tracker, launched at COP29, provides a snapshot of progress on the new round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Countries were due to submit their updated NDCs, which map out national climate ambitions through 2035, in February 2025. As of today, 67 countries—representing 36% of global emissions—have submitted a new NDC, while 130 countries have yet to submit one. So far, this latest round boosts the emission reductions from the 2020 NDCs by 1.9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, equal to the annual emissions from roughly 500 coal-fired power plants.

NDC Breakdown: Notably missing from the new NDC submissions are China and the EU. China, the world’s largest emitter, foreshadowed its NDC at the September 2025 UN General Assembly meeting, promising to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. Meanwhile, the EU, the world’s fourth-largest emitter, shared in September that its upcoming NDC is expected to include a 66.25-72.5% cut in emissions by 2035 and a net emissions reduction of 90% by 2040, both compared to 1990 levels.

Update on Global Stocktake Progress: A new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the COP30 Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance assesses global progress following the first global stocktake, which was agreed to at COP28. The resulting UAE Consensus established a goal to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency efforts by 2030. The report finds that two years later, energy efficiency modifications in buildings have been nominal and renewable energy growth has fallen short—despite record-breaking renewable energy capacity being added to grids around the world.

Climate Action off the Rails: Last week, WRI’s Systems Change Lab published the State of Climate Action 2025. The annual report uses 45 indicators to assess global progress on meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). The Systems Change Lab determined that, of the 45 indicators, 29 are “well off-track,” six are moving in the right direction but falling behind, five are going in the wrong direction completely, and there are insufficient data for the rest.

Granary of Solutions: Each year, the COP Presidency appoints a high-level climate champion responsible for advancing the “Action Agenda” around COP. The Action Agenda is designed to connect the negotiations to real-world, on-the-ground climate work. This year, it has six themes and 30 objectives, as well as a “Granary of Solutions” that provides case studies of “existing solutions [that] accelerate and scale up impact in alignment with the global stocktake and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” There is an open call for engagement, solutions, and input. In alignment with the Action Agenda, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy has created its own Granary of Solutions to highlight U.S. businesses leading the way on greenhouse gas emissions reductions at home and abroad.

About Stella Vita

Self-sufficient design: Stella Vita is built to be a self-sustaining ""house on wheels,"" using solar energy to power itself and its internal systems.

Travel and living: The solar panels on its roof provide enough energy for both driving and living, including cooking, running a fridge, and charging devices.

Pop-up roof: When parked, the roof slides up to provide standing room, and additional solar panels fold out to double the solar surface area for more efficient charging.

Aerodynamic shape: While driving, the roof collapses to create a more aerodynamic, teardrop shape that minimizes air resistance.

Range: On a sunny day, Stella Vita can travel approximately 730 km (about 453 miles) without needing to charge at a station.

Demonstration trip: The student team completed an 1,800+ mile road trip from the Netherlands to Tarifa, Spain, to demonstrate its capabilities

""Stella and its successors Stella Lux, Stella Vie and Stella Era are a series of solar racing family cars, built for the World Solar Challenge in Australia, sofar winning its Cruiser Class all four times it was held – in 2013, 2015, 2017 and in 2019. Stella is considered the world’s first solar-powered family car and was given the 'Best Technology Development' Award at the 8th annual Crunchies in San Francisco in 2015.

""Being the only competing vehicle with a license plate, the road registration of Stella contributed to the winning score in the races. The vehicles are designed and built by ""Solar Team Eindhoven"" (STE) — some 26 students of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. The group have set up a non-profit foundation to promote their concepts for practical solar vehicles for adoption on a broader scale."" (Wikipedia)

""Stella won the inaugural edition of the new for 2013, Michelin-sponsored Cruiser Class of the WSC, completing the 3,022 kilometres (1,878 mi) race distance in 40 hours and 14 minutes, at an average speed of 75 kilometres per hour (47 mph), while typically carrying three occupants, for a total of 9,093 occupant kilometres (5,651 passenger miles).

""The Stella is a very boxy, but low-built car. With only 1.15 metres (45 in) height, and its two large doors opening upwards, it is as tricky to get in and out of as a super-sportscar. However, once inside, reviewers found it surprisingly comfortable.

""The whole of the top of the car is covered in solar panels, and the rear slopes down to create a teardrop shape to reduce air resistance. The car weighs only 388 kilograms (855 lb) thanks to being constructed largely out of carbon-fiber, reinforced by welded aluminium tubing."" (Wikipedia)

Our Self-sustaining House On Wheels

""Stella Vita is our Self-Sustaining House On Wheels. A mobile home wherein you can live and work while travelling on the energy of the sun. Stella Vita generates energy through its solar panels on the roof and uses this energy for both driving and living,"" the Stella Vita official website says.

""Stella Vita generates enough solar energy to drive, shower, watch TV, charge your laptop and make coffee. You are completely self-sustaining and independent. Hereby, you are free to go wherever you want, without harming the environment.""

""It is fully equipped with living essentials including a double bed, sofa, kitchen area and a bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet. It can fit two people, who can drive, cook breakfast and watch television using just the vehicle’s solar-charged battery, according to its creators – 22 students at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands,"" the CNN reports.

""The vehicle can typically travel up to 600 kilometers (373 miles) on its 60-kWh battery when fully charged, even at night and when it is cloudy.

""On a day when the sun is shining throughout, its range increases by an extra 130 kilometers (81 miles). The team drove approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) between each destination, at a top speed of 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour.""

""A group of 22 coeds working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven has just unveiled Stella Vita, the world’s first entirely solar-powered camper, according to Ars Technica,"" the Robb Report says.

""The vehicle features a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that the students claim produce enough electricity to travel over 450 miles in a single day.

""The Stella Vita, which the team calls a self-sustaining “house on wheels,” features a teardrop design that slopes dramatically in the rear. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing of designs, but the long roof provides plenty of surface area for solar panels.""

""The vehicle has a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that is said to generate enough electricity to cover 730 kilometers in a day.

Stella Vita is described as a self-sustainable motor home. It features a design with a sloping roof to increase the surface area of ​​the solar panels,"" the Telegrafi says.

""Two separate towers below the roofline protrude from either side of the vehicle, effectively doubling the surface area of ​​the solar panels to 17.5 square meters. Inside there is a small cooking area with a solar-powered fridge, as well as a toilet, a sofa and a full-sized bed with space for two adults.

""It was created by a group of 22 students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven.""

""The world's first fully self-sufficient 'house on wheels' - designed and developed by students from Eindhoven University of Technology - will arrive in Tarifa, the southernmost tip of Spain, on Friday. This means that Solar Team Eindhoven has reached the final destination of its tour from the Netherlands to Spain on energy from the sun. The student team organised the trip to show the future of sustainable mobility with their self-built green campervan,"" the Eindhoven University of Technology says.

""In one and a half years, Solar Team Eindhoven designed and built Stella Vita, as the futuristic-looking vehicle is called. The solar vehicle has a roof that slides up electrically when standing still, giving you a standing height of 2.5 metres.

""This makes it easy to stand inside to cook, sleep or work. Additional solar panels fold out when the roof is up, doubling the solar surface area to a whopping 17.5 square metres.""

Introduction

Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider and remove program obligations for most source categories under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and suspend program obligations for other sources until reporting year 2034.

Business Roundtable remains concerned by the growing risks from global climate change, including significant economic risks (e.g., technological and market shifts and regulatory and policy risks). Business Roundtable member companies are leading by example, developing and deploying ambitious emissions reduction plans, and exporting innovative technologies that will help lower emissions in the United States and globally, while simultaneously spurring innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. Business Roundtable looks forward to helping advance policies that leverage U.S. leadership, competitiveness and innovation to mitigate the impacts of global climate change while growing our economy.

Business Roundtable welcomes the Administration’s commitment to addressing burdensome regulations, including paperwork and reporting burdens. However, we are concerned that a sudden change to the current program could result in piecemeal, duplicative, incomplete and more burdensome greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting obligations for U.S. companies that also disadvantage them globally. We urge EPA to carefully consider options that would allow the GHGRP reporting framework to continue so that it is not inadvertently recreated at an even greater expense to U.S. business in a scattershot, non-uniform way via other state and foreign governmental avenues. We also urge the agency to hear from stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the agency’s actions and take the necessary steps to coordinate across federal agencies that would also face impacts from the proposal.

GHGRP Data is a Critical Tool for Various Reporting, Disclosure and Compliance Obligations

The GHGRP provides standardized, facility-level emissions data that U.S. companies have relied on for effective regulatory enforcement, tax credit administration, international trade compliance and voluntary disclosures. The proposed changes risk fragmenting emissions reporting across the U.S. economy, introducing regulatory uncertainty and upending an existing process for international trade compliance, particularly for U.S. exports. The comprehensive data set that GHGRP provides, including current emissions levels and historical trends, is also important for helping to prevent ill-informed policies from being adopted.

GHGRP data is central to the administration of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).2 Under current IRS rules, CO₂ injected into secure geologic storage qualifies only if verified under Subpart RR with an EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Removing this pathway would potentially jeopardize sequestration projects, create regulatory uncertainty and chill investment. This would undermine the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that preserved 45Q and increased the value of the credit in some circumstances. At a minimum, elimination of GHGRP will require the IRS to amend its regulations to require new monitoring, reporting and verification protocols—prior to EPA finalizing this rule. Timing is of the essence to ensure the left hand is aware of the right hand’s actions, such that a gap between changes does not undermine investments in major infrastructure projects, including projects based on 45Q credits that taxpayers are relying on in the 2025 tax year.

Other credits such as 45V (clean hydrogen), 40B (sustainable aviation fuel), 45Z (clean fuel production credit) and 48C (advanced energy projects credit) rely on emissions factors from Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model,3 which uses this federally verified GHGRP data as a key input. It is unclear how this data can be replicated in a cost effective or timely way should EPA remove GHGRP obligations, thus creating uncertainty for past, current and future investment decisions relying on these credits. Again, if EPA were to move forward with a final rule that prevents companies from utilizing GHGRP data to claim inextricably linked federal tax credits, Business Roundtable would encourage ample time be afforded to stakeholder engagement to build consensus with private businesses that have relied on U.S. tax policies enacted and sustained with bipartisan support in Congress, which could be abruptly undermined if EPA does not engage across government agencies, particularly with the Department of Treasury in this instance.

Elimination of GHGRP Likely Will Result in Piecemeal Reporting Obligations That Are Incompatible, Incomplete and More Expensive

GHGRP provides a trusted dataset used by state regulators and private companies. If GHGRP obligations were to cease, some states can be expected to step into the void and promulgate their own data collection and reporting obligations. These new requirements, adopted on a piecemeal state-level basis, are at significant risk of becoming inconsistent, creating a cumbersome, balkanized and more expensive reporting obligation for companies subject to the requirements than if the current GHGRP were to continue as is.

EPA estimates the total cost of reporting to be $303 million per year, with subpart W reporting accounting for $256 million of the annual costs.4 Under EPA’s proposed rule, subpart W companies would be relieved of their reporting obligations until 2034.

Companies that are subject to GHGRP have made the necessary investments to monitor emissions, and capture and report the required data. One-time hardware and software investments and employee training necessary to be able to report the data required by GHGRP far exceed on-going costs associated with the program. While on-going reporting costs are not inconsequential, we would expect them to be significantly less than the costs that would be incurred by businesses if they are required to recreate and comply with differing monitoring and reporting obligations likely to emerge at the state and international level if GHGRP were to end. This fragmented reporting system would in turn result in higher costs and less data consistency than if the current GHGRP was left in place. Simply put, the result of the repeal of the GHGRP will be to impose costs that are likely to far exceed the estimated savings associated with repealing the current program in exchange for a sub-optimal, inconsistent, fragmented reporting system.

U.S. Competitiveness in Foreign Markets Would be Undermined

U.S. exports of energy-intensive products would be disadvantaged under the proposed rule. Data transparency provides the backbone of the U.S. competitive position on energy dominance. Credible and verified GHGRP data is vital for U.S. competitiveness in global markets, especially with the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), low carbon fuel (LCF) and methane regulations. Without federally verified GHGRP data, U.S. exporters may face default emissions penalties, higher compliance costs and loss of market access. The United States is Europe’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplier and a major oil exporter to these markets. Moreover, without the GHGRP data to demonstrate our manufacturing emissions profile, the United States may end up with a higher default value under CBAM, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness in Europe. The net result of eliminating GHGRP could inadvertently harm U.S. competitiveness by weakening exports and run counter to the President’s “Energy Dominance” agenda.

EPA Should Maintain GHGRP as a Voluntary Program if it Determines the Clean Air Act (CAA) Cannot Legally Support a Mandatory Program

In its proposal, EPA indicated that it “considered the alternative of transitioning the GHGRP from mandatory to voluntary reporting” but ultimately rejected this option because it “could also result in submittal of incomplete or piecemeal reports, and the verification and accuracy of the data submitted would be limited.”5 EPA also concludes that “maintaining continuous or intermittent reporting under any of these source categories, including voluntary reporting, is inconsistent with CAA section 114 (emphasis added).”6

Business Roundtable believes EPA’s authority to administer a voluntary program is consistent with section 114. CAA section 114 allows EPA to collect emissions information for GHGs as the CAA contains an underlying statutory purpose to reduce “air pollutants” that can potentially be regulated under the CAA. EPA recently acknowledged its authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA, even if it declines to exercise such authority in the proposed rescission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding (“’Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate’” GHG emissions,7 quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in AEP v. Connecticut “The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”).8

Business Roundtable maintains that EPA has the legal authority to regulate GHG emissions if it makes the requisite findings and closely hews any regulatory response to the limitations of the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. EPA9 the Court determined that GHGs are covered by the CAA’s section 302(g) definition of “air pollutant,” and that therefore EPA can impose regulations of GHG emissions once the EPA makes the requisite findings under the CAA. Neither UARG v. EPA10 nor West Virginia v. EPA,11 two cases that struck down EPA’s expansive claims of authority to regulated GHGs, disturbed this central finding.

Although EPA asserts that “since 2011 [the EPA] has not used most of the information collected to carry out other provisions under the CAA”12, EPA can potentially use this information for regulation of GHGs. GHGRP supplies the data necessary for informed decision-making for deciding whether, when and how to regulate GHGs. Accordingly, we believe EPA retains the authority to regulate GHGs and as a corollary, to allow voluntary data collection efforts to inform the agency’s future regulatory efforts.

If EPA is concerned about incomplete data, it may still establish minimum standards for voluntary participation, and we encourage it to do so if it chooses to maintain a voluntary program.

EPA has experience with voluntary programs, including programs directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions.13 Retaining GHGRP as a voluntary program should not be unduly burdensome, nor is it inconsistent with EPA’s legal views regarding the limitations of section 114. Moreover, retention of GHGRP in some form will avoid the multiple rulemakings, inconsistent reporting obligations and international trade and regulatory uncertainty that will result if GHGRP is repealed.

Business Roundtable remains committed to working with the Administration to provide the certainty and predictability that American businesses need to thrive and compete, including by ensuring access to reliable, affordable energy.

SM Energy’s net income for Q3 fell despite an increase in oil production

Shares of SM Energy (SM) and Civitas Resources (CIVI) were trading higher in premarket on Monday, after the energy companies announced a merger agreement.

$12.8 Billion Combined Entity

SM Energy and Civitas Resources announced an all-stock transaction to create a combined oil and gas company with an enterprise value of about $12.8 billion. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Under the deal, Civitas shareholders will receive 1.45 shares of SM Energy common stock for each Civitas share. SM Energy shareholders will own around 48% of the combined entity, while Civitas stockholders will own approximately 52%.

The merger combines an asset base of approximately 823,000 net acres, which includes the Permian Basin in the southern US. The basin is known for its rich petroleum and natural gas deposits.

The combined firm is expected to generate over $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2025 and achieve an annual production value of $200 million, potentially rising to $300 million. The transaction is projected to be immediately accretive to key per-share metrics.

“This merger combines two premier operators and establishes a company with transformative scale in the highest-return U.S. shale basins. By combining two complementary portfolios, we expect to unlock significant free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate stockholder returns, and position us for sustainable growth through every cycle,” said Beth McDonald, President and Chief Operating Officer of SM Energy.

SM’s Q3 Results

Earlier in the day, SM Energy posted its Q3 results. Production in the third quarter totaled 19.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Total daily production rose 26% while oil output jumped 47%. Net income for the quarter was $155.1 million, compared with $240.5 million a year earlier. The decline in earnings was mainly due to lower realized prices, reduced derivative gains, and higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses.

What Are Stocktwits Users Saying?

The news of the merger prompted a shift in retail sentiment to ‘bullish’ from ‘neutral’ for both companies on Stocktwits.

SM Energy shares were up 2.9% at $21.5, while Civitas’ stock shot up 4.8% to $30.2.

Both stocks have been under heavy selling pressure this year, with CIVI’s stock declining 38.3% and SM’s shares tanking more than 47%.

Driving an electric vehicle could soon mean charging as you go. A new wireless charging pilot in France is showing how coils built into the road can transfer more than 300 kilowatts of power to moving EVs. This breakthrough could make long trips possible without stopping at a charging station.

The road that powers your vehicle

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson. Together, they’ve installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car, and bus-all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW, and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That’s strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it’s only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in, or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

Kurt’s key takeaways

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute, and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration, and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.
