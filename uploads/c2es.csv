And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.","Just like the dusty vinyl records your parents were on the verge of tossing for years, nuclear power is undergoing a renaissance.

For decades, the energy source fell out of favor due to safety concerns and high plant construction costs; its share of the world’s electricity supply plummeted to 9% in 2024 from 17% in 1996, according to the global energy think tank Ember.

But in recent years, amid advances in safety and experimental tech promising greater affordability, many countries have begun to view nuclear power generation as a source of scalable low-carbon energy. Meanwhile, tech giants have started bankrolling reactors to power the AI boom.

America united around splitting atoms

In the US, the embrace of nuclear energy has been bipartisan. During the Biden administration, Congress passed subsidies to incentivize the deployment of nuclear energy. And in his second term, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles for new reactors, with the stated aim of quadrupling capacity by 2050.

Over a dozen reactors have been closed in the US since 2012, and no new large-scale nuclear power plants are getting built—yet. But as anticipated next-gen reactors undergo regulatory review, several older decommissioned ones are getting de-mothballed:

A decommissioned reactor at Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in American history, is due to go back online (it wasn’t involved in the 1979 accident). The reactor’s owner, Constellation Energy, signed a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft last year.

And this summer, the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan became the first decommissioned US nuclear power plant to return to operational status, financed in part by a $1.5 billion loan from the Department of Energy.

The world powers ahead

Despite the renewed enthusiasm in the US, the vast majority of new capacity is coming online in other countries.

China, which lacks fossil fuel reserves, has added 80% of the world’s new nuclear capacity in the past five years and is due to surpass the US in total nuclear power generation, according to the International Energy Agency.

Meanwhile, the EU gave nuclear power a boost when it recognized it as a clean energy source, making it eligible for government subsidies. France currently plans to build six new nuclear reactors.

The UK plans to increase its nuclear capacity to meet 25% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from 15% currently. And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.",https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2025-10-03/image-e03047069db278dce2007d49063bd0c18087db7c-5280x3624-jpg/GettyImages-2177851466.webp,N,,2025-10-05 03:58:11.672423

For Jesse Lore, the owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, N.H., that means September has been busy. On Monday night, with a little over 24 hours left until the tax credit deadline, he was juggling several customers.

“It’s crazy, and the phone doesn’t stop ringing, but that’s a good thing,” he said. “Make hay while the sun is shining.”

Until Tuesday night, EV buyers could get a tax credit for $4,000 on a used car and $7,500 on a new car. As those credits drew closer to expiring, electric car sales accelerated across the country.

Lore says his business has seen about a 70% increase in September sales over last year. But come Wednesday, all the cars on his lot under $25,000 — the maximum price for the used EV tax credit — will get more expensive. And lots of people bought cars ahead of the deadline. Lore expects the combination of those factors to pump the breaks on his sales.

Green Wave, like other dealers, offered the tax credits as “cash on the hood,” selling cars for a discounted price and then getting reimbursed by the federal government. But in recent weeks, Lore says those payments have been stalled.

“We’re still out well over $100,000 in terms of cash that we have not been paid on. And that’s a lot for a small business,” he said.

Lore said his team discussed whether to stop offering the credit and ask their customers to file for it themselves. But ultimately, they decided to keep selling cars for the discount until the deadline.

“We believe that the law is clear. We believe that we will get paid,” he said.

As tax credits wind down, Lore says there may be an unexpected silver lining. Traditional dealerships may buy fewer electric vehicles, causing wholesale prices to drop.

“There’s a lot of fierce competition in the marketplace for car sales,” he said. “As wholesale prices go down, so too will retail prices.”

Lore says that price drop won’t make up for the loss of the credits, but could help consumers a little. And, he said, he’s hoping decreases in development costs and batteries will drive the cost of electric cars below gas cars over the next decade.

“That’s coming up,” he said. “But today it’s not necessarily there.”

Incumbent Carrboro Mayor Barbara Foushee, Carrboro Mayor Pro Tem Danny Nowell, Carrboro Town Council member Cristóbal Palmerand former Carrboro poet laureate Fred Joiner were present.

Executive director of the Community Empowerment Fund Donna Carrington moderated the forum.

Housing Access and Affordability

Carrington began by asking Joiner, the only non-incumbent candidate, what the Town is doing well to promote housing access and affordability, and what he would change if elected.

Joiner said he is still learning about the Town's processes and thinks streamlining engagement with developers would increase accessibility.

Carrington asked incumbent candidates on how their understanding of the Town’s affordable housing needs has changed since they have been in office, and how they would address those needs in their next term.

Nowell said the Town must focus aggressively on increasing affordable housing units through gap financing projects and innovative loan structures.

“Right now, we are in a crisis. We have fallen so far behind that it is not just a need to add housing — it is an emergency,” Palmer said.

Palmer also said the intersection between Town policies must be utilized to increase housing access and affordability.

Foushee said the Town did well in adding another half-cent to the property tax rate to be invested in affordable housing this past budget cycle. She said she looks forward to the Town’s new Unified Development Ordinance and collaborations with other municipalities.

Homelessness

Carrington asked candidates how they would address the needs of Carrboro’s unhoused population.

Foushee said she doesn’t want poverty or homelessness to be criminalized, but approached collaboratively by those impacted, business owners and organizations.

Palmer said he agreed with Foushee about preventing criminalization, and a disconnect exists between elected officials and those working with the chronically unhoused.

Nowell said the Town must use strategies like revolving loan funds to induce developers to create more affordable units.

Joiner said creative solutions are essential to ensuring housing for those who don’t meet area median income requirements but remain in need.

Response to Funding Cuts

Carrington asked candidates how they planned to build infrastructure support as federal and state financial resources are shifted away from the community.

Carrboro’s budgetary structure, which relies heavily on property taxes, makes the Town somewhat less vulnerable than other communities, Nowell said.

Nowell said he is looking to make the design process for infrastructure projects more efficient to increase the Town’s competitiveness.

Joiner said the community must strengthen mutual aid bonds to protect itself against funding losses.

Palmer said he believes in normalizing conversations around salary to better support those most vulnerable to the effects of cuts.

Foushee said appropriate action will be gauged as Carrboro recovers from Tropical Storm Chantal, which later downgraded to a depression, and that federal and state funding is becoming less reliable.

""I feel like, more and more, we can't rely on that much,"" Foushee said.

Transportation

Candidates were asked which active transportation projects they would prioritize in office and why. They were also asked about any projects they would like to introduce if elected.

Palmer said adding an East-West corridor connection to the North-South Bus Rapid Transit project would be ideal. He also said the most recent budget had effectively greenlit many impactful projects.

Joiner said he would like to expand sensibly on strategies to reduce the Town’s usage of cars.

Foushee said she is excited for the building of a sidewalk on South Greensboro Street and the implementation of the Vision Zero strategy, especially its Safe Routes to School traffic safety program. She wants investment in the expansion of public transit services for more frequent service, she said.

Nowell said community members should act on existing plans from the Town website’s project lists in collaboration with local organizations to target priority areas.

Climate Resilience

As a final question, Carrington asked candidates about making Carrboro more climate resilient.

Foushee said educating the community is key to safety during disasters.

Palmer said community members should consider Community Emergency Response Team training and involvement with the Green Neighborhoods Grant Program.

Nowell said actions to increase climate resiliency should incorporate mutual aid strategies. He also said that the Town should decrease dependency on cars.

""We will not have a climate resilient community or a climate resilient world if we are dependent on cars,"" Nowell said.

Joiner said climate resilience must be built into the community through infrastructure and housing choices.

Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually.
Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems.
The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects.
As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.","Every year, Americans discard an astonishing amount of edible food, and the financial fallout is massive. From the latest financial study in 2023 alone, the United States generated an estimated 73.9 million tons of surplus food—food that was grown, processed, and purchased but never eaten. The overwhelming majority of that surplus ultimately became waste. Economists estimate the direct value of that discarded food at roughly $338 billion, a figure that ripples across households, businesses, and supply chains.

For the average consumer, this waste is far more than an abstract statistic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calculates that each person effectively pays about $728 annually for food that ends up in the trash. For a typical household of four, that amounts to nearly $3,000 each year—money spent on groceries, restaurant meals, and take-out that provides no nourishment and no return. Much of this loss comes down to everyday behavior: overbuying at the grocery store, cooking more than is consumed, poor storage practices, and a widespread misunderstanding of date labels on packaging.

Expiration dates are a particularly costly culprit. Outside of infant formula, date labels in the United States are not federally regulated safety indicators. Most “sell by,” “best if used by,” and “use by” dates are suggestions for peak quality, not hard cutoffs for edibility. Yet consumers frequently treat these dates as expiration notices and throw out perfectly good food. This single misunderstanding sends billions of dollars’ worth of edible products into the garbage each year. It is a preventable form of loss that requires no new technology or infrastructure—only clear communication and more informed household decision-making.

The economic consequences extend far beyond family budgets. For retailers and restaurants, wasted food means thinner profit margins. Overstocking shelves, serving oversized portions, and poor demand forecasting lead to unsold inventory that must be hauled away at a cost. Farms and food processors face their own economic losses when perfectly good crops are left unharvested due to cosmetic standards, labor shortages, or volatile market conditions. Across the entire food system, this inefficiency represents squandered land, water, energy, and labor—resources that have already been paid for but ultimately generate no economic value.

Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually. While the numbers have stabilized somewhat since pandemic-era disruptions, 2023’s totals returned to pre-2020 levels, showing how persistent the issue remains. Retail sectors have made modest gains through improved inventory management, but plate waste and spoilage at the consumer level continue to dominate the problem.

The implications are both economic and environmental. Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems. Reducing waste offers a rare dual benefit: returning billions to household budgets and business balance sheets while lowering environmental impact without requiring large-scale new spending.

The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects. Small changes in household behavior—more accurate meal planning, proper food storage, and a better understanding of labels—can collectively translate into billions of dollars saved each year. As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.",https://www.grantspasstribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-waste.png,N,,2025-10-04 23:57:51.880899

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

""This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,"" Symons said. ""Whittling away at EPA's ability to do its job.""

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Governor Moore said at the dam site. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers.”

Comprehensive Environmental Investment

The $340 million commitment includes operational improvements and both upfront and ongoing annual payments, distributed across several key environmental initiatives over the dam’s license term:

Water Quality and Resiliency: $87.6 million for pollution reduction efforts, including shoreline restoration, forest buffers, and planting underwater grasses.

Trash and Debris Removal: $77.8 million to strengthen efforts to clear debris, which currently averages about 600 tons annually.

Aquatic Life Passage: More than $28 million for fish and eel passage improvements, aimed at helping American shad, river herring, and freshwater mussels rebound.

Freshwater Mussel Restoration: $23.3 million to build and operate a hatchery to seed the river with mussels, which act as natural water filters.

Dredging Studies: $18.7 million to support additional studies on dredging the dam’s reservoir.

The agreement resolves a long-standing legal challenge regarding the dam’s environmental impacts. An initial 2018 water quality certification and subsequent 2019 settlement were vacated by an appeals court in 2022, prompting a year of mediation that led to the new deal.

Economic and Clean Energy Impact

Constellation Energy’s President and CEO, Joe Dominguez, noted that the agreement supports the dam’s role as the state’s largest source of renewable energy.

“The Susquehanna watershed is home to one of the largest concentrations of clean energy generation in America, and Constellation is proud to build on that nearly century-old legacy,” Dominguez said.

State officials highlighted the economic benefits of a cleaner Bay, which underpins a $3.2 billion annual tourism economy and a seafood industry contributing nearly $600 million to the state each year.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown praised the collaborative effort. “This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” he said.

The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and a companion settlement agreement. MDE Secretary Serena McIlwain confirmed that all parties, including the environmental groups who had challenged the previous framework, have signed on.

“With this agreement, we are protecting clean water and vibrant ecosystems for generations to come while supporting jobs, commerce, and energy security,” McIlwain said.",https://www.nottinghammd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Governor-Wes-Moore-Conowingo-Dam-Agreement-202510.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:26.330380

— Geoffrey Chan

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RadiansPlus Technologies, a pioneer in sustainable grid innovation, today announced the launch of PSN-DLM (Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management), a groundbreaking technology that redefines how electric vehicle (EV) charging and distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems interact with existing grid infrastructure.

As cities worldwide race toward net-zero targets, grid capacity constraints have emerged as a critical barrier to scaling EV charging and solar adoption—especially in high-density urban environments. Traditional approaches rely on expensive, time-consuming grid upgrades or battery energy storage systems (BESS), often passing significant costs onto consumers or taxpayers while generating additional embodied carbon during construction.

Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management (PSN-DLM) changes the game. Built on RadiansPlus’ patented Power System Neutral (PSN) architecture, PSN-DLM intelligently orchestrates real-time energy demand and supply by differentiating between power (instantaneous load) and energy (total consumption over time). The system dynamically manages flexible loads—such as EV charging—and modulates solar export to align with available grid capacity, ensuring seamless integration without overloading substations or feeders.

Key Benefits of Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management:

• Zero Grid Expansion Required: Enables full utilization of existing grid assets, deferring or eliminating the need for costly upgrades.

• 80%+ Cost Savings: Compared to conventional grid reinforcement or BESS deployment.

• Equitable Access: Makes EV charging and solar energy accessible in underserved communities, public housing, and dense urban zones.

• Grid-Friendly Integration: Real-time coordination between EVs, PV systems, and grid constraints ensures stability and maximizes renewable utilization.

• Rapid Deployment: Short certification and installation timelines accelerate time-to-value for charge point operators (CPOs), building owners, and utilities.

“PSN-DLM delivers the ‘friendly handshake’ the energy transition desperately needs—between EVs, solar panels, and the grid,” said Geoffrey Chan, Co-Founder & Technical Director of RadiansPlus Technologies. “By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, we unlock the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

The technology has already been validated across multiple pilot sites in Asia, including public housing estates in Hong Kong and Singapore, commercial hubs like VivoCity Mall, and transportation infrastructure managed by airport authorities. These deployments demonstrate grid utilization improvements of up to 90% and the ability to support EV charging loads up to 200% of original substation capacity—without hardware upgrades.

PSN-DLM is part of RadiansPlus’ integrated “Solution in a Box” offering, compatible with OCPP standards and is preparing for a future where it is ready for integration with BESS and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks. The company is actively engaging with utilities, regulators, CPOs, and real estate developers to scale deployment across Asia and beyond.

According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.
“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.
“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said.","PHNOM PENH — Cambodia has experienced dramatic economic growth in recent decades, fueled by energy-intensive industries and rapid urbanization. But experts warn that without energy-efficient practices in factories, businesses and buildings, the country risks unnecessary energy waste.

Cambodia aims to reduce energy consumption by at least 19 percent by 2030 according to its 2022-2030 National Energy Efficiency Policy, as the country sees the advantage of using lower energy for similar or better performance to reap the economic benefits.

According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.

“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.

Rey Sopheak, national expert at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), said that energy efficiency is essential for industrial parks to save costs and improve competitiveness, adding that industrial parks need to address both energy and water consumption to ensure sustainability.

“The concept of agro-industrial parks can help integrate different industries and create value from waste,” he said. “Collaboration between different factories in an industrial park can create a stronger voice for energy efficiency improvements.”

The industrial sector's energy demand in Cambodia has notably increased, going from 8,850 GWh in 2010 to 20,411 GWh in 2019, reflecting heightened industrial activities and energy requirements. The national policy aims for a 20 percent reduction in thermal and electrical energy consumption in the Industrial Sector by 2030, targeting approximately 30,000 GWh, which would represent a saving of nearly 10,000 GWh.

Elaine Jarry, country representative of Geres—an NGO promoting sustainable energy and combating climate change—said that energy efficiency is crucial for garment factories due to climate change and the need for cleaner construction.

“The garment factories need to adopt energy-efficiency measures to stay competitive and relevant,” she said. “The adoption of energy efficiency can help factories reduce costs and ensure smooth transitions.”

Jarry emphasized the importance of energy efficiency to meet national targets and for the country to remain attractive to investors.

Tin Mola, infrastructure lead of the economic development program CAPRED funded by Australia, said that CAPRED has focused on demonstrating the viability of the ESCO [energy service companies] business model in Cambodia to ensure that investment in energy efficiency is supported, which involves an energy-service company providing capital and expertise.

“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said. “The ESCO business model is an alternative, innovative financing model because energy efficiency investment costs money.” The model assists large energy consumers in investing in more efficient equipment, which can help these companies lower energy expenses and boost their competitiveness, he added.

According to people in the field, despite national policies promoting energy efficiency, gaps in regulations, limited data and a shortage of skilled professionals continue to slow Cambodia’s push toward its ambitious energy transition goals.

Elaine Jarry of the NGO Geres said that the organization has worked with the government with the aim of reducing the gap between actual and ambitious energy efficiency targets through realistic solutions and multi-stakeholder approaches. Recent and ongoing projects have included improved cook stoves, charcoal projects, and innovative low-impact living projects.

Vongchanh Kinnaleth, researcher at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC), said that the institute has been playing a role in supporting the development of a skilled workforce in energy efficiency, focusing on training human resources, particularly in engineering.

“ITC offers training programs for certified energy managers and energy auditors,” she said. “The training programs aim to address the limited professional skills in energy efficiency.”

ITC collaborates with energy consumers and development partners to promote the importance of energy management and certify professionals, she added.

Tin Mola of CAPRED explained that the ESCO (energy service companies) model is challenging but promising due to the clear commercial incentives. However, the lack of data records from factories is a significant challenge in implementing the ESCO model, she said.

“CAPRED is working on developing energy performance contracts and measurement and verification processes [and] ESCOs need access to finance to scale up their operations,” she said, pointing out the bond policies to support energy efficiency in 2026 and calling for effective implementation of existing policies and tweaking them to make them better.

During the discussions, Mahfuzur Rahman of GGGI suggested implementing the energy management program and designating energy consumers, while Rey Sopheak of UNIDO stressed the need for actual numbers and results after policy implementation. Elaine Jarry of Geres added that awareness and basic settings for energy-consumption reduction are important.

Cambodia aims for a significant clean energy transition, targeting 70 percent renewable energy by 2030. The Cambodian government also intends to attract industries such as car-part production and electronics manufacturing, which are expected to raise energy demand to 38,600 GWh annually by 2030 due to their high energy consumption.",https://img.cambodianess.com/uploads/article/10-2025/1759566154.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:31.467062

Several high-ranking government officials have raised serious concerns about energy storage — namely, does it even exist, and even if it does exist, then isn’t it too expensive? Apparently those concerns are not top of mind for the judges of the prestigious Earthshot Prize. They have just tapped the US iron-air battery startup Form Energy to join 14 other finalists in the final round. The hotly competitive, highly selective global program saw almost 2,500 other promising nominees try and fail to make the final cut this year.

Does Energy Storage Actually Exist?

Regardless of the official US position on energy storage, the Founder and President of the Earthshot Prize seems convinced that it exists. That would be Prince William, who had this to say as the program arrives at its five-year anniversary:

“The Earthshot Prize has shown that the answers to our planet’s greatest challenges not only already exist, but that they are firmly within our grasp.”

Is he delusional? Maybe! Either way, Form Energy’s iron-air battery worked its way through the Earthshot Prize selection process to rise to the top of the Fix Our Climate category, so in all likelihood it does exist.

The finalist stage is also a rare, celebration-worthy achievement for the US. The EarthShot judges have tapped 60 finalists since the program launched in 2020. Only a scant handful of US-based firms have reached the final round.

The Form Energy Iron-Air Solution: Follow The Money

Of course, the real question about energy storage is not an existential one. It’s a duration one.

Today’s lithium-ion batteries typically last about four hours or less, enabling them to fill in during peak demand periods. They can also be paired with virtual power plants and other modern 21st century technologies to forestall the need to build expensive new gas peaker plants, and to introduce more wind and solar power into the grid.

However, we are 25% into the 21st century and gas power plants are still very much in demand. The need for more powerful, more economical wind and solar energy storage platforms was already clear when Form Energy launched in 2017, with plans to develop an iron-air long-duration battery based on the principle of “reversible rusting.” The company soon coalesced around a product that can deliver electricity for 100 hours. In addition to duration and cost, iron-air technology also gets points on supply chain and fire safety, too.

That sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. Iron has been explored as an energy storage material for decades without gaining much traction, two key challenges being scale-up and efficiency.

Form Energy has been hammering away at the problem since its launch in 2017, with a $9 million Series A assist from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and The Engine among others, followed by a $40 million Series B round in 2019, a $76 million Series C round in 2020, and onward to $240 million in Series D, and another $450 million (Series E), and then another $405 million (Series F) last year.

CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley has been following the company regularly up through last year, when he took note of the company’s forthcoming energy storage project in Maine. The article attracted dozens of comments ranging from “I think this is really promising” to “this does not look like a good battery.”

Safety & Cost-Cutting

Comments aside, Earthshot Prize is not the only entity to determine that Form Energy falls on the “really promising” side of the scale. Form already has a number of contracts and utility partners in hand. The company also passed a key fire safety test last December, when it demonstrated that the iron-air battery conforms to UL9540A standards at the cell level. When battery cells meet those standards, there is no need for further testing at the module or system level.

“UL9540A is a critical safety benchmark in the energy storage industry, designed to evaluate a battery’s potential for thermal runaway and its ability to prevent the spread of heat or fire,” Form explains.

“Form Energy’s iron-air battery cells underwent rigorous testing, including multiple short-circuit failure modes in both charging and discharging conditions,” the company adds. “Even when subjected to extreme scenarios, such as charging while short-circuited or overcharging for seven continuous days, the cells remained stable with no uncontrolled heating or thermal runaway,” the company adds.

The focus on safety is a significant cost advantage, eliminating the need for fireproofing systems. The inherent safety of the system can also smooth the way for approval in urban environments and other locations where fire risk raises public concerns.

Next Steps For Energy Storage In The US

No word yet on whether or not the White House will celebrate Form Energy’s selection as an Earthshot finalist, vaulting the US into the upper ranks of a high profile global competition. After all, it’s almost like being nominated for a Nobel Prize.

The Energy and Interior Departments have already weighed in on the matter, along with the Environmental Protection Agency. Having thoroughly investigated the question of whether or not energy storage costs too much, even if it does exist, the heads of these three agencies have determined, well, who knows what.

Meanwhile, innovation in the the energy storage field continues apace, and other long duration alternatives to lithium-ion batteries have been cropping up. Last year BloombergNEF ran the numbers and noted that these new systems face the challenge of Li-ion’s long head start on cost, including economies of scale and mature supply chains. Still, BNEF determined that thermal and compressed air systems have already closed the gap.

“Thermal energy storage and compressed air storage are the least expensive LDES technologies, at $232 per kilowatt-hour and $293 per kWh of capex, respectively, data from the survey shows. For comparison, lithium-ion systems had an average capex of $304/kWh for four-hour duration systems in 2023,” BNEF noted. The survey was based on the firm’s 6+ hour definition for long duration.

In case you’re wondering, Li-ion doesn’t lend itself to the long duration format, that’s a good question. BNEF has an answer. “The unit costs of most long-duration energy storage solutions typically drop with each hour of storage added, so LDES technologies can scale more efficiently compared to lithium-ion batteries,” BNEF notes.

Long duration or not, the US energy storage market is still holding firm, despite the fantasy of a battery-free world articulated by some high ranking federal officials. The US-based global consulting firm Coherent Market Insights, for example, has just issued a new report under the title “U.S. Advanced Energy Storage Market Set to See Incredible Growth 2025–2032.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/form-energy-factory-long-duration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:49.544449

The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 after a scandal involving Democratic candidates in the 1938 election using Works Progress Administration workers to help with their campaigns and dangled agency jobs to help win votes.

The act was amended in 1993 and again in 2012 to relax prohibitions on federal employees engaging in political activity. While both amendments weakened the law they did not change the basic tenet of the law which is prohibiting the engagement in political activity while on duty, using federal resources, or wearing a uniform.

The law specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch while on duty from engaging in partisan political activities, such as campaigning, distributing political materials, or posting partisan messages on social media.

It also specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch from using their position or official authority to influence the outcome of an election or to coerce subordinates.

And it prohibits the use of government material for political activity.

The goals are to ensure non-partisan administration of programs, protect employees from coercion, and encourage merit-based employment.

In short it prohibits executive branch employees from using the power and authority of the federal government for partisan purposes.

The current activity of federal executive branch employees appears to totally disregard the law, but that should be a surprise with an administration that has disregarded federal laws time and time again.

The attitude is “do it and let them sue because we have the Supreme Court behind us.”

A federal court judge recently ruled President Trump lacked legal authority to order National Guard troops into Los Angeles to put down demonstrations against the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement who were going to Home Depots to round up undocumented immigrants to deport and to farms as well often grabbing people off the street while agents were unidentified, wearing masks and in civilian vehicles.

Since that time, he has sent the National Guard and federal law enforcement officials into Memphis, Portland, Oregon, and into Chicago and surrounding areas.

And the Trump administration has usurped the constitutional “power of the purse” from Congress, and is deciding what money appropriated by Congress will be spent and what will not.

This weekend the federal government is in shutdown mode because there are not enough votes in the Senate to pass a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open.

Republicans hold the majority in the House, the Senate and hold the Oval Office, but due to Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to pass budget bills that are not dressed up as reconciliation, needing only a majority to pass, which is what the One Big Beautiful Bill was when it passed the Senate by the Vice President’s one vote, and the House by four votes.

That bill contained significant cuts to the Medicaid program which will have far reaching effects across the country and here in New Hampshire leaving millions without healthcare insurance.

The bill also did not include money for the tax credits for the Medicaid expansion program passed under the Affordable Care Act, which will send insurance premiums skyrocketing for people who purchase their health insurance through the marketplace established under the bill.

Democrats sought to include the funding for the tax credits in the continuing resolution in order to help those folks to continue to afford health insurance.

As we know in New Hampshire, uninsured people using the health care system who do not pay for the services, raise the premiums for those on private health insurance programs.

If you know you have to negotiate with Democrats in the Senate to gain the needed 60 votes, but refuse to budge at the urging of the president, you have a problem and most Americans will blame the party in power when the government shuts down.

But that is not the message the president and Republicans want the public to hear, they want to blame the “far left radical” Democrats who don’t have enough votes to pass anything in Congress.

So what has the Trump administration done to convince the American people they are not to blame for closing national parks and various other government services

This is the message on the White Mountain National Forest website since the shutdown began.

“The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

If that isn’t a violation of the Hatch Act, I don’t know what is.

The US Health and Human Services website has this message on its Home page.

“Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”

This is on the State Department’s home page.

“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume.”

The Housing and Urban Development website has this message:

“The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”

The United State Department of Agriculture has the message in big bold letters on its homepage.

“Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Some agencies are nondescript like commerce which simply says because of the shutdown, the website will not be updated, which is similar to what NASA posted, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s website does not even mention the shutdown.

Maybe the Trump Administration has written off anyone who frequents the EPA website believing they are all anti-Trumpers.

What is being done in Trump’s executive department by executive branch employees is clearly illegal.

But who are you going to complain to, Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is in the president’s back pocket, or one of handpicked US District Attorneys?

And even if whoever is responsible for the messages on the federal agency websites is found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, he or she will not lose his or her job as the original law required, but will only be fined.

And if they do get caught red handed, all they have to say is the president ordered the messages be put up, because he and Vice President JD Vance are exempt from the Hatch law.

This is what happens when the power and authority of the federal government is used for partisan purposes or for one person’s agenda.

This is what happens in Russia with Vladimir Putin, in Hungary with Viktor Orbáne and in Turkey with Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

You can no longer believe anything the government tells you, and that is ruinous and will take generations to work through, if ever.

How can offices curb waste? How can industries reduce consumption? But hidden behind the rooftops glittering with solar panels lies a lesser-told story. Before a single ray of sunlight is ever captured, the making of that panel itself is a battle of efficiency, one that could define whether our clean energy future is truly sustainable.

Walk into a modern solar plant, and it does not feel like the gritty industrial units of the past. Instead, it resembles a high-tech operating room, humming with automation, precision robotics, AI scanners, and even circular water systems. These silent heroes are rewriting the rules of sustainability from the inside out. As India’s renewable capacity surges to 220.1 GW, nearly half from solar, the efficiency of these factories matters just as much as the panels they produce.

Automation: The Micron-Level Revolution

A solar panel’s story begins with wafers, thin slices of silicon that must be cut and aligned with near-perfect accuracy. Even a fraction of a millimetre off can lead to wasted material, higher defect rates, and greater energy use. This is where automation steps in like a surgeon’s scalpel. Robots now manage processes with micron-level precision, ensuring thinner cuts, cleaner edges, and consistent quality.

This is not just about output. Every avoided defect means fewer wasted wafers, fewer re-runs on energy-intensive machinery, and lower costs. In FY 2024–25 alone, India’s solar module manufacturing capacity doubled from 38 GW to 74 GW, a leap made possible by both scale and smarter processes. Automation has quietly become the foundation of this rapid rise.

Smart Testing: AI as the Silent Detective

Not long ago, solar panels were evaluated through repeated manual checks, often consuming time, workforce, and significant energy. Now, AI-powered defect detection and high-speed imaging work like detectives on the assembly line. Electroluminescence scans catch microscopic flaws in real-time, preventing waste before it even begins.

The result? Panels that consistently meet higher standards while cutting down on wasted resources during quality assurance. Smarter testing ensures that efficiency is not just about quantity, but about reliability, fewer rejections, fewer re-tests, and stronger products.

Water: The Invisible Resource

When we think of solar energy, water rarely enters the conversation. Yet plants are water-intensive, relying on it for cooling, cleaning, and chemical processes. Left unchecked, this could strain already scarce reserves. Technology is again shifting the paradigm.

Closed-loop systems now recycle water within the factory, reducing freshwater intake by as much as 80–90%. This quiet transformation shows that efficiency is not only about electricity saved, but also about conserving every resource, every drop.

A Blueprint for the Future

Put together, automation, digital testing, and circular water management are turning solar factories into models of efficiency. They are not merely production hubs but blueprints for the future of sustainable manufacturing.

This is where Energy Efficiency Day needs a wider lens. The focus should not end at homes, offices, or city infrastructure. It must extend to the very heart of clean energy production itself. If solar factories can cut waste, conserve resources, and embed intelligence into every process, then the lessons travel far beyond one sector.

Because the truth is this: building panels that capture sunlight is only half the challenge. The other half is ensuring the process of making them reflects the very sustainability we aspire to achieve.

On this Energy Efficiency Day, perhaps the most powerful message is this: efficiency is not just a choice, it is the DNA of the clean energy transition.

By replacing imported fossil fuels with electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy, net imports of fossil fuels can decrease by 70 percent.
The ASEAN region and Bangladesh have surpassed the US in terms of electrification of final energy demand.
Half the world has reached a peak in fossil fuels for electricity.","Solar energy and wind power account for the majority of growth in electricity production globally.

Electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy can reduce fossil fuel imports by 70 percent and save 1.3 trillion dollars annually.

China has reduced its use of fossil fuels for electricity production by 2 percent during the first half of 2025.

A technological transformation of the energy system

The energy system is undergoing the most extensive transformation since the transition from biomass to fossil fuels in the 18th century, according to a new report by Ember.

Three groups of technologies are forming what is called electrotech: renewable energy from solar and wind, electric demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps, and connections through batteries and digitalization.

Electricity is now driven by rapidly growing renewable energy sources and enables efficiency gains through electrification across the entire economy. For the world's countries, this offers a path to energy security.

Electrotech is three times more efficient

Electrotech is approximately three times more efficient than fossil fuel systems. Fossil systems waste two-thirds of primary energy, equivalent to 380 exajoules, as heat at a cost of 5 trillion dollars every year. Solar and electrification provide access to 100 times more energy than fossil fuels.

Costs fall with increased production

Electrotech is manufactured in modules, which creates clear learning curves. Costs fall by approximately 20 percent every time production doubles. Electrotech already accounts for two-thirds of global energy investments and all expected growth in energy jobs.

In 2023, electrotech contributed 10 percent of global GDP growth. In China, the figure was 22 percent, in India 5 percent, in the EU 30 percent and in the US 7 percent.

More countries can become energy independent

80 percent of the world's population lives in countries that import fossil fuels. Over 50 countries import more than half of their primary energy as fossil fuels. In contrast, 92 percent of countries have renewable energy potential that is more than ten times their current demand.

By replacing imported fossil fuels with electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy, net imports of fossil fuels can decrease by 70 percent. This would save 1.3 trillion dollars globally each year.

Exponential growth for decades

Solar energy capacity has doubled every three years on average for 30 years. Since 2020, battery storage has nearly doubled every year. Solar energy has gone from being among the smallest to the largest capacity source in a decade.

Solar and wind dominate growth in electricity demand. Electricity accounts for almost all growth in final energy use in buildings, industry and road transport. In 2007, electricity surpassed oil as the largest supplier of useful energy.

Sales of vehicles with combustion engines have decreased since 2017. During the same period, sales of electric vehicles have increased 15 times to 17.5 million.

China drives the global transformation

China's domestic deployment of electrotech is extensive. The country accounts for half of global solar panel installations, 60 percent of electric vehicle sales and two-thirds of global growth in electricity demand since 2019.

During the first half of 2025, China's use of fossil fuels for electricity production decreased by 2 percent. This is significant because global demand for fossil fuels excluding China has been unchanged since 2018.

Emerging markets take the step directly

Led by China, emerging markets are deploying electrotech on a large scale. The global sun belt is beginning to benefit from its high insolation levels. 63 percent of electricity demand in emerging markets comes from solar as a share of production, which is higher than in the US.

The ASEAN region and Bangladesh have surpassed the US in terms of electrification of final energy demand.

Three-quarters of energy needs can be electrified

Leading regions and countries already get more than half of their electricity from solar and wind. A penetration of 70-80 percent from solar and wind at a reasonable price is within reach today.

Technical innovation in electric transport and heat pumps has increased the share of global final energy demand that can be electrified from 25 percent in 2000 to 75 percent in 2025. Further innovation is working on the remaining 25 percent in shipping, aviation and high-temperature heat.

Fossil fuels on track to decline

Demand for fossil fuels has been unchanged for industrial energy since 2014, for buildings since 2018 and for road transport since 2019. Two-thirds of countries have already reached a peak in demand for fossil fuels in end-use sectors. Half the world has reached a peak in fossil fuels for electricity.

If current trends continue for deployment of renewable energy and electrification, demand for fossil fuels will decline from 2030.",https://www.warpnews.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/Solar-wind-cover.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:43.361916

That was the sentiment Thursday as local officials and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gathered to celebrate mixed-use development in Hudsonville's city center that was funded through a public-private partnership.

""Targeting brownfield assessment money allows a community and the developers to know what they're getting into,"" said Ann Vogel, Region 5 administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In May, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy announced that Ottawa County received a $500,000 brownfield assessment grant as part of a $6.7 million federal investment from the EPA.

Brownfield grants are used to assess what kind of contaminants or pollution might be on the property and what has to be done to clean it up. Some of the funds have been used to assess old properties in Hudsonville.

The money was for environmental site assessments, cleanup planning and community engagement in Grand Haven and Holland.

Abandoned properties sometimes don't have records documenting the parcel's previous uses. If it were used as an industrial site, hazardous waste could be left behind. The EPA funds pay for deep research and assessment of the property to gather the background information for potential developers.

After the EPA helps pay for the cleanup, Vogel said it's up to the local community to decide on the parcel's future uses.

In Hudsonville, the funds have been focused on housing projects, such as the recently completed Prospect Flats, and the under-construction Terra Station, both along Prospect Avenue in Hudsonville, west of 32nd Street.

""Hudsonville knew they needed more housing,"" Vogel said. ""They are a growing area of the state.""

Vogel pointed out the expanding job opportunities to both the east and west of Hudsonville, in Grand Rapids and Zeeland. However, she said, the EPA funds could be made available to support commercial development or even public buildings like schools.

""Whatever the case may be for the community,"" she said. ""But again, here in Hudsonville, what we're looking at is housing.""

Getting Prospect Flats built was a long road for the property, which once had blighted homes and buildings that the city tore down more than a decade ago. Moxie Group received some brownfield funds for environmental assessment and found some ground contamination that had to be cleaned up before new residences could be safely built there.

""Everything showed a fuel tank from the 1920s,"" said Trevor Petroelje, developer at Moxie. ""We searched for it for a whole day with an excavator and couldn't find anything ... so it must have been removed at some point.""

Remediation also often involves the removal and replacement of contaminated soils.

Petroelje said projects like Prospect Flats are virtually impossible without incentives through the state and federal government.

""The numbers do not work in today's financial climate,"" he said. ""And if they did work without the incentives, the rental rates would be at a place that, they would be unaffordable for people.""

In 2023, Michigan amended the Brownfield Redevelopment Financing Act to include financing for housing-focused development through the Ottawa County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority. Essentially, the state uses some tax revenue to reimburse a developer for building something they wouldn't build otherwise.

Q1 | 2:15: Lagway pitches it to Clark on 3rd-and-2, and he muscles for a three yard gain and a first down. UF is 4-4 on third down and has already gained more yards through the first 13 minutes than it did all game against Miami.

Q1 | 2:34: Lagway's first real miss of the day comes when he looks for Sturdivant on 2nd-and-2. Gators face a third down near the red zone.

Q1 | 3:38: Have a day, Jadan Baugh. Another electric run, breaking tackles for a gain of 12 yards and another Florida first down.

Q1 | 4:28: Lagway starts the drive with a throw to a wide open J. Michael Sturdivant for a 23-yard line. That's Lagway's second completion for 20 or more air yards all season. On the next play, Baugh runs right for a gain of 16, and UF is on the UT 41-yard line.

Q1 | 5:12: Jack Bouwmeester punts for Texas, and it is nearly saved at the 1-yard line, but ultimately, it falls for a touchdown. 40-yard punt with no return. UF takes over at the 20-yard line.

Q1 | 5:22: On 3rd-and-10, Manning is chased right and is forced to throw it away. The Longhorns will line up to punt.

Q1 | 5:44: Manning makes a nice play with his legs, gaining 14 for a Texas first down. One play later, however, and he's swallowed up behind the line by Myles Graham. Texas at the UF 40-yard line.

TOUCHDOWN: Q1 | 7:58: Lagway hands it to Baugh, who runs right and finds the end zone for a five-yard score. Smack hits the PAT, and the Gators take a 7-0 lead. That drive went 13 plays, 84 yards and featured six first downs.

Q1 | 8:01: The rain is now coming down HARD here at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Florida faces a 3rd-and-1 at the Texas 5-yard line.

Q1 | 9:35: Baugh with all sorts of space down the middle of the field for a big gain of 12. That's five first downs for UF on the opening drive.

Q1 | 10:33: At midfield, the Gators face a 3rd-and-4. They hand the ball to Brown III on a designed play, and he goes around the edge for a gain of 14 yards. 2-2 on third downs for UF on this opening drive.

Q1 | 12:11: As the rain starts to fall once again, Florida faces a 3rd-and-6. Lagway drops back and finds Aidan Mizell, who gets 9 yards for the conversion. That's the first third-down conversion by the Gators since the LSU game.

Q1 | 14:34: On the opening play, Lagway finds freshman Dallas Wilson, who is blown up and he fumbles. He manages to recover. Not the way the true freshman wanted his first career catch to go.

KICKOFF: Will Stone boots it for the Longhorns, and we are underway. Vernell Brown III runs it out of the end zone, and is tripped up at the 15-yard line. Poor starting field position for the Gators.

PREGAME:

The Longhorns have won the coin toss and they choose to defer. Florida will start with the ball. It is 82 degrees outside, and the wind is blowing 7 miles per hour.

While the rain has halted, the wind has picked up once again. Skies are seemingly clearing, but in a slow matter.

The rain has picked up a little bit as pregame warmups conclude. No signs of lightning or any delay.

A light drizzle has started around 3:00, and fans begin to take out their ponchos. The wind is still heavy.

Inside, some fans snapped photos with an oversized Lombardi Trophy made out of recycled plastic collected from the stadium while others strolled to their seats carrying beverages in recyclable aluminum cups.

“These are real nice cups,” said Tre Simon, a fan who was impressed at how cold the aluminum cup kept his drink. “Keep this going … I think it’s perfect.”

Stadium staff manually sort recyclables, and an on-site compactor crushes aluminum so the metal can be sold for recycling. The Linc recycled 18 tons of aluminum in 2024 and reinvested the money into the stadium’s sustainability program.

The venue is among several NFL stadiums, also including those in Atlanta and Santa Clara, that have made strides in lowering their carbon footprints by installing solar panels and creating composting and recycling programs. Powering jumbotrons, bright lights and air conditioning requires huge amounts of energy, which can take its toll on the environment. Experts said the moves are a step in the right direction and encourage fans of the most-watched sport in the United States to try similar approaches at home.

“You always want to root for a team that’s doing good by the environment and the community,” said Brendan Gee, an Eagles fan at another home game.

“Why not recycle when you can, and solar panels are pretty cool I guess,” said Jakub Dzafic, another Eagles fan, who added: “Any NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB team should try and do that when they can.”

Solar panels and energy credits

Lincoln Financial Field is considered a leader in venue sustainability. The solar panels produce about 40% of the stadium’s energy annually and renewable energy credits are purchased to offset the rest, said Norman Vossschulte, the Eagles’ vice president of fan experience and sustainability.

“Our hope is that our efforts will inspire our fans to do the same and take some of their own actions. If we all did something, I think it’d make a big difference,” Vossschulte said.

Large sporting events can produce a lot of waste and consume massive amounts of energy. Asked whether a stadium can ever be truly sustainable, Tony Lamanna, construction management professor at Arizona State University, said “every bit counts. “

“I don’t think you necessarily have to be net zero to be making an impact,” he said.

Lamanna said stadium sustainability encompasses both how the venue reduces its own footprint and how it influences fans’ habits.

“If you can model the right actions to the 80,000 fans or however many you have in your stadium, think of the impact,” he said.

Keeping waste out of landfills

Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home to the Falcons in Atlanta, became the first professional sports stadium internationally to achieve a Total Resource Use and Efficiency Platinum certification for diverting 90% or more of its waste from landfills.

“I’d say 98% of what you get out of a concession or point of sale is compostable,” said Adam Fullerton, the stadium’s vice president of operations.

The stadium has a garden that grows fruits and vegetables used by the culinary team, a 680,000-gallon (2,574,080 liter) cistern that collects rainwater that is used for irrigation and 4,000 solar panels. At games, fans who are spotted recycling can be featured on the stadium video board and win a signed jersey. Fullerton said fans seek out the sustainability team in hopes of being spotted.

“Start small and at least start doing something,” is Fullerton’s advice for venues that are interested in becoming more sustainable.

He said it costs about 10 cents per fan who attend events to run the zero waste program.

“In the grand scheme of things, that’s pretty cheap,” he said.

Waste created by tailgating outside the stadium remains a challenge because the parking lots can be outside the scope of the stadium’s waste management program. “It’s really difficult to control what a fan brings with them” to a tailgate, said Fullerton.

Fans can practice sustainability and minimize tailgate waste by packaging food and beverages in reusable containers and placing all waste and recyclables in their corresponding bins, taking public transit and adjusting home thermostats when they leave to save energy and money.

How sustainable marketing can lead to behavior changes

The visibility of stadium sustainability initiatives leads to a sense of group identity and increases the likelihood that fans will adopt that mindset as their own, said Karen Winterich, professor of sustainability and marketing at the Pennsylvania State University.

“One big thing we know about any sort of behavior change, and that includes sustainable behaviors, is that consumers are really motivated by identity, social norms and social pressures,” she said. When everyone puts their can into a stadium recycling bin, it increases the odds they’ll do so at home.

Climate change and renewable energy, especially solar and wind, are topics that are highly politicized. “I think it’s really strategic by the NFL … they’re talking about it for the benefits, but not in a polarizing way,” said Winterich. She said a strategy that often works to get people on board with sustainability is highlighting the benefits of on-site energy usage and how the local environment benefits from less pollution, composting and recycling.

NFL Green, the league’s sustainability program, aims to leave “a green legacy in the communities we visit,” said Anna Isaacson, the league’s senior vice president of social responsibility. For major events such as the Super Bowl, NFL Green hosts community feedback sessions that have inspired efforts such as the league financially supporting a coastal wetland project in Louisiana, where the 2025 Super Bowl was held.

The next Super Bowl will be held at the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Some of the stadium’s sustainable initiatives include 1,162 solar panels, a rooftop garden that yields about 10,000 pounds of crops annually, and recycling and composting 70% of all materials.

“The Bay Area is our home and it’s a unique place with tons of natural beauty. So our goal is to keep our community clean, not just for now, but for the future,” said Francine Melendez Hughes, executive vice president and general manager of Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody … we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she’s confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

Governmental policies and direct incentives are reshaping the lithium mining landscape. Legislative acts such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) represent strategic investments in critical minerals through:

Production-based tax credits and investment incentives for domestic mineral projects

Expedited permitting processes for strategic lithium extraction and developments

Mandatory U.S. and North American sourcing for government-procured electronics, EVs, and batteries

Funding for R&D in clean extraction methods and environmental stewardship

Cross-border agreements to facilitate lithium trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico

Beyond the IRA, state-level incentives—notably in Nevada—continue to attract investment, further establishing the United States as a top-tier region for lithium production.

Trend 6: Market Forecasts and the Evolving Lithium Demand

Understanding the 2025 Lithium Demand Surge in North America

Lithium demand is projected to set new records through 2025 due to the accelerated electrification of vehicles and grid energy storage.

North American lithium mines are expected to supply nearly 20% of domestic battery-grade lithium needs by 2025.

Worldwide, lithium demand is expected to increase by over 400% by 2030—with north american demand consistently outpacing local supply, underlining the need for capacity expansion and technological innovation.

Battery gigafactories under construction will require substantial, reliable lithium supplies, pushing companies to secure upstream feedstock.

Markets for grid storage, consumer electronics, and decentralized energy further fuel demand growth.

Satellite-Based Verification by Farmonaut facilitates more reliable lending and insurance in mining, increasing financing opportunities for mineral enterprises.

Trend 7: Strategic Partnerships and Cross-Border Collaboration

U.S., Canada, and Mexico: Building the North American Lithium Powerhouse

While the U.S. dominates in scaling up lithium extraction, Canada is rapidly growing (Nemaska Lithium, North American Lithium), and Mexico is emerging with new projects. These regions are:

Integrating cross-border supply chains to leverage comparative advantages in geology, technology, and infrastructure.

Harmonizing environmental standards and regulatory frameworks to facilitate new project development.

Collaborating on research and workforce development to ensure a continuous pipeline of skilled talent for the lithium sector.

Jointly investing in infrastructure modernization—transport routes, processing plants, and energy grids—especially in regions like Quebec and Nevada.

These cross-border initiatives reduce dependence on foreign sources and position North America as a strategic lithium hub for global markets.

The Challenges Facing North American Lithium Companies

Yet, the three-wheeled segment of electric mobility consistently manages to disappoint. I’ve previously noted the unrealistic optimism and gushing hype surrounding companies like Aptera, Arcimoto, and ElectraMeccanica Solo, but their current situations underline just how fundamentally flawed these business models have always been. After a couple of years of patiently waiting for Aptera to finally fold, the time has come to close off on this. Two of these ventures are effectively dead, while the third is barely clinging to life with no clear path forward.

Aptera epitomizes the chronic failure endemic to three-wheeled EV startups. Promising a lightweight, aerodynamic, solar-powered three-wheeler that captivated EV enthusiasts and media alike, Aptera quickly racked up tens of thousands of reservation deposits. Yet, despite a lot of puff pieces in the press and close to $200 million burned over 20 years, Aptera has not delivered a single vehicle to any of these hopeful customers.

According to its SEC filings in 2024, Aptera had just $13.6 million remaining in cash and had hemorrhaged $95 million in losses over the previous two years. To date, their primary deliverable remains glossy renderings rather than actual automobiles. With the automotive equivalent of no money, no confirmed and firm vendors, and ongoing changes to vehicle architecture, Aptera’s last statement on the subject was that they needed only $60 million to enter production. That’s been the story for two decades.

No credible industry analyst or observer seriously expects Aptera to begin production, let alone scale it profitably, given this stark financial reality.

The Bottom Line Judge Cain’s ruling guarantees offshore energy will remain a political and legal battleground well past the next election.","A ruling in Lake Charles just cracked open Biden’s “permanent” drilling bans—and gave oil markets a future they’d nearly written off.

LAKE CHARLES, La. — Inside a modest courtroom not far from the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. District Judge James D. Cain Jr. issued a decision on October 3 that could reshape America’s energy map for decades. In one stroke, he overturned President Joe Biden’s attempt to place sweeping offshore drilling areas off-limits forever, ruling that the president had reached beyond his legal authority.

The case may sound technical, but its stakes are enormous. The ruling touches vast swaths of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and even Alaska’s Bering Sea—waters federal experts believe hold around 90 billion barrels of oil and 327 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. More than a resource fight, though, this is about power. Judge Cain’s order signals that presidents can’t unilaterally lock away offshore territory forever, leaving the oil market to re-price opportunities it thought were gone for good.

When “Forever” Collides with the Courts

At the heart of the case sat a deceptively simple question: does the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act allow presidents to make offshore drilling bans permanent, or only temporary?

Judge Cain’s answer was blunt—permanent bans go too far. Biden’s orders, which carried no expiration dates, crossed into Congress’s lane. The judge leaned on the Supreme Court’s increasingly weighty “Major Questions Doctrine,” which says big-ticket decisions with massive economic fallout can’t rest on vague executive authority.

One analyst put it in plain English: “If you want to close the door forever on trillions of dollars in energy, you’ll need Congress to say so.”

The lawsuit came from the American Petroleum Institute and a group of Republican-led states including Louisiana, Texas, and Alaska. They walked away with a partial but powerful win.

What the Market Really Heard

On paper, the ruling doesn’t pump a single new barrel tomorrow. Offshore projects often take five to seven years before oil or gas flows. Still, Judge Cain effectively restored something Wall Street loves: optionality.

Instead of writing these waters off for good, investors now see them as “maybe, someday.” That subtle shift carries big weight. Drilling contractors, offshore service firms, and equipment makers suddenly hold call options on future work they thought had vanished. Risk premiums across the offshore supply chain may shrink, even before new lease sales hit the calendar.

As one Houston energy strategist put it: “Smart money isn’t chasing immediate barrels. It’s betting the U.S. offshore once again matters in the long game—especially when OPEC flexes or politics shift.”

A Legal Tug-of-War with No Clear Winner

The decision also deepens a messy contradiction in federal courts. Back in 2019, a judge in Alaska ruled the opposite—that Trump couldn’t undo Obama’s offshore withdrawals without Congress. Now Cain has said Biden couldn’t impose his own permanent bans.

So which is it—withdrawals that last forever unless Congress intervenes, or withdrawals that only last until the next president changes course? The split is stark, and the Supreme Court will almost certainly have to weigh in.

Scholars note the larger irony: the statute at the center of all this, OCSLA, hasn’t been meaningfully updated since 1978. It predates climate science as we know it and leaves courts to referee battles lawmakers have avoided for decades.

The Politics of the Seafloor

The ruling also puts more power in the hands of whoever sits in the Oval Office. President Trump, in his first months back in office, quickly reversed Biden’s bans and reopened affected waters. Cain’s decision validated that move, ensuring future presidents will enjoy the same freedom unless Congress rewrites the rules.

The result is a dizzying cycle: presidents sign orders, lawsuits follow, courts weigh in, the next president flips the script, and the whole dance starts again. For Gulf Coast shipyards and Alaskan fishing towns, that means whiplash between booms and busts. Oil giants, meanwhile, now plan projects not around reservoir lifespans but presidential terms.

State governments won’t sit idle either. Blue states are likely to use coastal zone laws and permitting tools to slow development, while red states grease the skids. Geography, not just geology, may determine which offshore fields ever see a drill bit.

Climate Advocates Shift Their Battle Plan

Environmental groups wasted no time announcing an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative benches in the country. If the court upholds Cain’s decision, the fight will almost certainly land at the Supreme Court.

But activists aren’t waiting. Recognizing that permanent withdrawals may be off the table, they’re already pivoting to procedural fights. Instead of sweeping bans, they’ll challenge individual lease sales under environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

“The strategy moves from ‘no’ to ‘slow,’” explained one law professor. That means case-by-case battles over whales in the Gulf, seismic surveys in Alaska, and climate impact reviews. Death by a thousand delays can be just as effective as an outright ban, especially since offshore projects rely on long-term certainty. A rig that makes sense with seven years of lead time may collapse under the math if it drags to fifteen.

Investors Look for Signals

For investors, this ruling doesn’t scream “green light” so much as “watch this space.” Don’t expect a rush of new rigs tomorrow. Do expect quiet increases in seismic surveys, acreage swaps between companies, and design work that lays groundwork for future drilling.

Companies with lighter exposure—drilling contractors, subsea equipment makers, and Gulf Coast yards with diversified businesses—stand to gain first. Offshore wind developers, on the other hand, may find themselves squeezed as federal agencies redirect attention back to oil and gas leasing.

Analysts recommend adjusting models: build in longer permitting timelines, higher compliance costs, and more frequent court delays. But factor in lower risk of a permanent federal shutdown.

The Bottom Line

Judge Cain’s ruling guarantees offshore energy will remain a political and legal battleground well past the next election. Expect narrower, time-limited withdrawals from the Biden administration, offset by aggressive leasing pushes from Trump’s Interior Department. Neither side will secure total victory.

The bigger lesson is clear. When Congress refuses to modernize outdated laws, the courts and the White House fill the void, leaving energy policy swinging between extremes. For markets, that means maximum uncertainty wrapped in the illusion of clarity.

Investors can now buy the idea of U.S. offshore potential, but whether those barrels ever come to market is anyone’s guess. The answer will depend on judges, elections, and a Congress that hasn’t touched the rulebook since bell-bottom jeans were still in fashion.",https://static.myboardtoday.com/app/fdcb87e3-3d43-4526-9db4-23dcf1b9f7ce/2892bd83-8838-4aec-acc9-af93aaf4c389_-_29b18b11-ae23-49bd-be16-4eaca83e996d-cover.webp,N,,2025-10-04 16:00:57.860627

Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

Meta announced a $10 billion, four-million-square-foot AI data center in Richland Parish, its largest in the world, which will require new natural gas plants.","In a Supreme Court docket stuffed with blockbuster cases, it has been easy to miss the news about a dispute with a puzzling line-up of litigants: a deep-red, energy-rich state — Louisiana — suing the very energy producers that have been central drivers of the state and national economy.

This case, and other similar ones, are not just legally dubious — they could also harm the country’s efforts to meet our growing energy challenges.

At the outset of World War II, the U.S. government recognized that oil was going to be a key to victory. Partnering with industry, Uncle Sam entered into numerous contracts for the production of crude oil. Much of that activity happened in Louisiana, and since the war ended the energy production in the state has only continued to expand.

Companies, acting with valid state and federal permits, have built a sprawling system of offshore production, pipelines and terminals. The state now ranks third in natural gas production, has one-sixth of the nation’s refining capacity and is home to a growing liquefied natural gas export capacity.

But starting in 2013, multiple Louisiana parishes have filed more than 40 lawsuits against the companies. They claimed that decades of oil and gas activity accelerated coastal land loss, and they are seeking billions of dollars in damages. This spring, a Plaquemines Parish jury hit Chevron with a $744.6 million verdict.

Chevron, supported by the Trump administration, former U.S. attorneys general and former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has now petitioned the Supreme Court to move the dispute from state to federal court, arguing that it is a more appropriate and fairer venue.

The jurisdictional question matters, but even more important is the impact these Louisiana lawsuits, and others like them around the country, could have on U.S. energy security, the economy and even conservation projects.

President Trump has made U.S. energy dominance a central priority. His Unleashing American Energy executive order directed increased exploration and production on federal lands and waters. A subsequent, companion order, Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, sought to curb state-level barriers to energy infrastructure.

The Louisiana lawsuits do exactly the opposite: They add uncertainty, invite endless litigation and send a chilling message to energy producers considering billions in new investment.

And the need for energy has never been greater. The artificial intelligence revolution is fueling a massive surge in electricity demand. Data centers consume enormous amounts of power, much of it supplied by natural gas.

Louisiana is already cashing in. Meta announced a $10 billion, four-million-square-foot AI data center in Richland Parish, its largest in the world, which will require new natural gas plants. Hut 8 is building a $2.5 billion campus in West Feliciana Parish.

These projects promise thousands of jobs and billions in investment. Yet they depend on the very energy infrastructure now under legal attack in Louisiana. The contradiction is striking: Local governments and juries are punishing oil and gas companies while the state is welcoming data-hungry industries that will only deepen reliance on them.

And just this year, in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress raised the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act revenue-sharing cap by 30 percent, from $500 million to $650 million per year. Of that, $487.5 million will go to Gulf Coast states, including Louisiana, and $162.5 million to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

Louisiana officials estimate this will mean an additional $46 million per year flowing directly into the state’s Coastal Trust Fund for restoration and environmental protection. But this increase only matters if production continues to grow, something that the lawsuits cut against.

So why is Louisiana pressing ahead? Many point to the influence of the trial bar. For years, trial lawyers have pushed these cases, which promise eye-popping payouts for local governments. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, despite his otherwise pro-industry profile, has thrown his weight behind the litigation.

It raises a blunt question: Are these lawsuits about saving wetlands, or about funneling billions from America’s energy backbone into the pockets of lawyers?

Louisiana should be leading the charge for American energy, not undermining it. The stakes here are bigger than Plaquemines Parish or even the Gulf Coast. They touch every American who depends on affordable and reliable energy.

The country should be pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy to meet our growing energy needs, supply energy to our allies, and build our economy. Policies that encourage responsible development are the way to go; lawsuits that seek to rewrite the rules and enrich trial lawyers are not.

Ecofin Agency: Endeavour Mining recently published its Q2 financial results. Can you reflect on your performance for the first half of the year?

Djaria Traoré : Our second-quarter results reinforced the strong momentum of the first half of 2025, with production of 647,000 ounces (over 18 tonnes of gold) at a sector-leading all-in sustaining cost of US$1,281 per ounce. In six months, we generated more than US$515 million in free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet and fully benefiting from a supportive gold price.

This performance reflects the quality of our portfolio and the consistency of our operational discipline. Beyond the numbers, it demonstrates our ability to deliver sustained value creation while maintaining strong local integration and resilience across our business.

Ecofin Agency: You hold a dual strategic role: ESG (environment, social and governance) and operations. What does this integration mean in practice for a group like Endeavour Mining? Can financial performance and social impact still be seen as separate in the mining industry? What is the link between operational resilience and ESG performance?

Djaria Traoré : This dual role highlights a fundamental reality: operational performance and ESG are directly connected. A mine that fails to invest in its people, build capacity for suppliers and host communities, or address its environmental impact increases its risk exposure and weakens its social licence to operate.

By contrast, embedding ESG into operations strengthens resilience and long-term value creation – reducing disruptions, lowering costs, reinforcing licence to operate, and driving measurable efficiency gains. ESG is not an add-on; it is a core driver of sustainable cash flow and portfolio strength.

“A mine that fails to invest in its people, build capacity for suppliers and host communities, or address its environmental impact increases its risk exposure and weakens its social licence to operate.”

That is why Endeavour has brought these two areas together within one department, ensuring ESG principles are fully embedded into daily operations and aligned with our long-term strategy.

Ecofin Agency: Your 2024 Annual Report highlights significant economic contributions (US$2.2 billion) and a local employment rate of nearly 97%. How do you explain the differentiated distribution of these contributions between Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso? How do these figures reflect a truly inclusive value creation model, and how can you ensure this value benefits mining regions sustainably?

Djaria Traoré : It is important to look beyond headline numbers and understand the impact they represent. Our mission goes further than producing gold – it is about creating meaningful value for the countries and regions where we operate.

In 2024, Endeavour delivered a total economic contribution of US$2.2 billion across our host countries. This included US$731 million paid in taxes, royalties and dividends to Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, directly supporting national budgets and public services.

“In 2024, Endeavour delivered a total economic contribution of US$2.2 billion across our host countries. This included US$731 million paid in taxes, royalties and dividends to Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, directly supporting national budgets and public services.”

We are also one of the largest private employers in West Africa, distributing US$271 million in salaries and benefits. Each direct job sustains many more through local supply chains, amplifying our impact across regional economies. In addition, 83% of our procurement – equivalent to US$1.23 billion – was spent in-country. This underscores our commitment to maximising local procurement, strengthening national supply chains, and ensuring that the value generated by our operations remains within host economies.

At the same time, we recognise that value is not measured in financial terms alone. Investments in education, healthcare, environmental protection and economic empowerment through our ESG programmes and the Endeavour Foundation are equally central to sustaining long-term value creation.

Ecofin Agency: Last year you launched a Sustainability Award for your employees. What ambitions do you hope to achieve through this initiative, and what types of projects or people do you want to highlight?

Djaria Traoré : The Sustainability Award embodies a simple but powerful belief: ESG should be a mindset shared by all our employees. It recognises those who, every day in the field, translate our commitments into concrete actions: protecting safety, preserving the environment, strengthening community ties, driving social innovation, or reducing our carbon footprint.

Beyond recognition, this award helps create momentum and demonstrates that everyone can contribute to our collective ambition. It is both a source of inspiration and a marker of company culture. Because being a responsible mining company means “bringing ESG to life” by enabling everyone to play their part.

Ecofin Agency: At Sabodala-Massawa, Endeavour has reduced its emissions by 24% thanks to the commissioning of a solar power plant. Do you now have a clear energy transition strategy for the whole group? How do you reconcile gold production with carbon neutrality?

Djaria Traoré : We are pursuing a clear decarbonisation roadmap: to reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030. To achieve this, we are deploying multiple levers such as grid connections, renewable energy, energy efficiency or alternative fuels.

In 2024, we inaugurated a 37 MWp solar plant at Sabodala-Massawa (Senegal), one of the largest in the mining sector in West Africa. Similar initiatives are under way elsewhere: renewable energy certificates at our Houndé and Mana sites (Burkina Faso), cleaner fuels at Ity (Côte d’Ivoire), and energy-efficient technologies at Lafigué (Côte d’Ivoire).

Gold production remains energy-intensive, but we are convinced that embedding climate ambition into industrial performance makes this reconciliation possible.

Ecofin Agency: Many stakeholders are asking mining companies to “do more” on transparency, inclusion or the environment. What are your concrete priorities for 2025? And in an African context where expectations are high and competition is intensifying, what distinguishes Endeavour Mining’s ESG approach?

Djaria Traoré : We fully integrate the expectations of strong governance, inclusion and responsibility into our activities. The taxes, royalties and dividends we pay are a vital resource for our host countries, directly funding public services and critical infrastructure.

That is why we commit to full transparency on these contributions. We apply the highest international governance and reporting standards, from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to the World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles. We were also among the first African gold producers to adopt the GRI 207 tax transparency standard, which goes beyond disclosing payments to cover tax governance, incentives and the presence in low-tax jurisdictions. This proactive approach sets us apart: we aim to remain a benchmark for responsible mining in Africa and to consolidate our role as a trusted partner for governments, communities and investors.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/8fc1defd33a0f3ef3b7c440137c19fde_S.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 23:58:01.140216

What Kern and the entire nation need is a balanced energy policy that includes support for fossil fuels and renewable energy.","Balance is the word we keep hearing in debates over local, state and federal energy policies.

No one energy source should be considered the only energy source to meet the nation’s growing needs. It requires oil production (one of Kern County’s major economic engines), as well as renewable energy.

Kern is rich in many energy sources — oil, solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuels, energy storage and likely other future sources.

For government to prioritize one source over others is short-sighted and damaging — to the people who work and live in Kern County, as well as the entire nation.

While other countries, notably China, are moving to dominate wind and solar energy development, the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie predicts renewable energy installations in the United States may be 18% lower over the next five years, as a result of the axing of federal tax credits, development grants and permits.

Citing “national security” concerns, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in August shut down construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind offshore project for Rhode Island and Connecticut. Work resumed after developers sued and a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C., ruled shutdown of the project, which is expected to power 350,000 homes, would irreparably harm developers. Continuing work was in the public’s interest. Already $5 billion had been spent getting the project to 80% completion. Construction delays were costing the company $2.3 million a day.

Declaring renewable energy projects to be a wasteful use of tax dollars, federal agencies over the past eight months have canceled or delayed support for more than 120 renewable energy projects across the nation. That amounts to nearly 14 gigawatts of energy — enough to power more than 8.4 million homes.

California’s plan to develop 25 gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy by 2045 was one of those projects. When federal funding was canceled, five ocean leases already had been granted to develop projects off the coast of Humboldt and Morro Bay. Last month, lawmakers and the governor reconfirmed state support for the plan, focusing money from Proposition 4, a bond measure California voters passed last year, to improve ports in Humboldt Bay and Long Beach to accommodate the wind energy project.

Nearly 25% of U.S. power generation is coming from renewable sources, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported in June. Renewable energy generation records are being broken in Texas, across the Great Plains states, in New England and the mid-Atlantic. In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, wind has become a big energy commodity.

Among renewable energy supporters are some of the largest fossil fuel producers. As an example, Shell Oil has significantly increased its investments in renewable energy sources, focusing on wind, solar and bioenergy projects globally. The company is actively involved in partnerships and collaborations to enhance renewable technologies. Volatile weather, electric vehicles and AI-focused data centers are driving up demand for all types of energy.

Critics call renewable energy undependable because solar plants operate at the mercy of the sun and wind projects operate at the mercy of the weather. But that has fueled a foot race among tech giants to build battery facilities to store energy for distribution during down times.

National energy policy has long been a political football kicked around by both Democratic and Republican administrations. Former Democratic President Joe Biden pulled the plug on the Keystone XL pipeline, which was already under construction. Republican President Donald Trump campaigned for reelection calling for increased oil, gas and coal production, and the slashing of funding for renewable energy projects, including solar and wind.

What Kern and the entire nation need is a balanced energy policy that includes support for fossil fuels and renewable energy. It doesn’t need politicians scoring political points and raking in campaign dollars at the expense of America’s energy future.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-10-04 20:00:47.145038

Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.","Coloradans’ window to receive thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles has closed. But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

The Maryland Offshore Wind Project and the Maryland Solar for All initiatives took significant blows after President Donald Trump cancelled grants for renewable projects across the nation.

Trump has described wind and solar as “expensive and unreliable energy sources,” seeking instead to promote domestic fossil fuel production.

Since the onset of his administration, Trump has signed 15 executive orders shifting federal policy away from renewable energy initiatives toward more traditional energy sources such as oil and coal.

Maryland Offshore Wind Project

On Sept. 12, the Trump administration filed a court order to reconsider approval of the Offshore Wind Project in its entirety. Despite a revocation of federal funding, Maryland Offshore Wind Project officials expect to win a legal challenge to the order.

“We intend to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them,” Nancy Sopko, US Wind’s vice president of external affairs said in a statement.

The Trump administration order is just the latest setback to the project. On Aug. 25, the administration filed a court order to revoke the federal government’s approval of funding for a steel manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point in Baltimore County.

The factory would provide steel for projects Marwin and Momentum Wind, which are wind energy farms being constructed off Maryland’s coast. The projects represent the first two of three planned phases of implementing offshore wind infrastructure in Maryland.

“The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) is in the process of reconsidering its prior approval of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project Construction and Operations Plan,” the suit states.

US Wind, the developer behind the offshore construction project, filed a counterclaim on Sept. 3, contesting the Trump administration’s environmental and economic concerns.

“Federal Defendants’ decision to vacate represents a drastic departure from their prior full-throated support and defense of the Project, and Federal Defendants have failed to acknowledge or offer a reasoned explanation for their about-face,” the filing in the U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland states.

The counterclaim also alleges that the revocation of US Wind’s permits was due to “political pressure…applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers.”

The Sparrows Point project is also slated to continue, according to Sopko.

On Aug. 29, the Department of Transportation announced that it would withdraw nearly $680 million from offshore wind projects, including nearly $50 million in federal funding for the nearly-completed wind turbine production facility in Maryland.

The Sparrows Point project and a dozen other wind projects lost federal funding due to a lack of alignment with the “goals and priorities of the administration,” according to a Transportation Department statement.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy indicated that these funds likely would be redirected into supporting the domestic maritime industry.

As part of a larger Maryland Offshore Wind Project, US Wind established the manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point to supply materials for the in-state construction of wind turbines. In November 2023, the Department of Transportation’s Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) awarded the $47 million in grant funding to help construct the factory.

Talks of constructing a Maryland wind farm began as early as 2010, when the federal Bureau of Offshore Energy Management put out feelers for interest in wind energy ventures off the East Coast.

In 2014, US Wind, Inc. won a bid for the 80,000-acre lease off the coast of Ocean City that would be the base for its Maryland Offshore Wind Project facilities.

The wind farm project was approved for construction by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2024. Overall, the project was expected to cost around $2.6 billion.

The Maryland Offshore Wind Project includes the construction of up to 114 wind turbines, along with four offshore substations and a meteorological tower. If completed, the wind farm would be able to power over 700,000 homes across the Delmarva Peninsula.

Many Ocean City officials and business leaders have long opposed the project, citing concerns that the turbines will disrupt tourism and wildlife and hurt property values.

Phase 1 of the project’s construction was anticipated to be completed in 2029.

Maryland Solar For All

The Maryland Clean Energy Center, located in College Park, also saw a cancellation of over $62 million in EPA solar-related funding on Aug. 7. The grant was administered last year through the national $7 billion Solar For All program, which has since been cancelled.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the end of the Solar For All program, stating that the “EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The Solar For All program, created by the Biden administration in April 2024, aimed to provide resources for residential solar projects in low-income areas. The grant to the Maryland Clean Energy Center would have helped to fund around 1,000 solar projects, adding a projected 10,000 households to solar power infrastructure.

Trump has remained critical of solar projects’ impacts on farmland, disapproving of federal investment in such programs.

“We will not approve…farmer destroying Solar,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!”

The Department of Energy earlier this month posted on X: “Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.”

Critics pounced on the post as uninformed, pointing out that wind and solar systems use storage batteries.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office replied on X: “We’re excited for the Trump Admin to learn about BATTERIES (we have them here in California, and they’ve helped the Golden State shift to green, clean energy AND keep the lights on).”

Inside, some fans snapped photos with an oversized Lombardi Trophy made out of recycled plastic collected from the stadium while others strolled to their seats carrying beverages in recyclable aluminum cups.

“These are real nice cups,” said Tre Simon, a fan who was impressed at how cold the aluminum cup kept his drink. “Keep this going ... I think it’s perfect.”

Stadium staff manually sort recyclables, and an on-site compactor crushes aluminum so the metal can be sold for recycling. The Linc recycled 18 tons of aluminum in 2024 and reinvested the money into the stadium’s sustainability program.

The venue is among several NFL stadiums, also including those in Atlanta and Santa Clara, that have made strides in lowering their carbon footprints by installing solar panels and creating composting and recycling programs. Powering jumbotrons, bright lights and air conditioning requires huge amounts of energy, which can take its toll on the environment. Experts said the moves are a step in the right direction and encourage fans of the most-watched sport in the United States to try similar approaches at home.

“You always want to root for a team that’s doing good by the environment and the community,” said Brendan Gee, an Eagles fan at another home game.

“Why not recycle when you can, and solar panels are pretty cool I guess,” said Jakub Dzafic, another Eagles fan, who added: “Any NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB team should try and do that when they can.""

Lincoln Financial Field is considered a leader in venue sustainability. The solar panels produce about 40% of the stadium's energy annually and renewable energy credits are purchased to offset the rest, said Norman Vossschulte, the Eagles' vice president of fan experience and sustainability.

“Our hope is that our efforts will inspire our fans to do the same and take some of their own actions. If we all did something, I think it’d make a big difference,” Vossschulte said.

Large sporting events can produce a lot of waste and consume massive amounts of energy. Asked whether a stadium can ever be truly sustainable, Tony Lamanna, construction management professor at Arizona State University, said “every bit counts. ""

""I don’t think you necessarily have to be net zero to be making an impact,” he said.

Lamanna said stadium sustainability encompasses both how the venue reduces its own footprint and how it influences fans' habits.

“If you can model the right actions to the 80,000 fans or however many you have in your stadium, think of the impact,"" he said.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home to the Falcons in Atlanta, became the first professional sports stadium internationally to achieve a Total Resource Use and Efficiency Platinum certification for diverting 90% or more of its waste from landfills.

“I’d say 98% of what you get out of a concession or point of sale is compostable,” said Adam Fullerton, the stadium's vice president of operations.

The stadium has a garden that grows fruits and vegetables used by the culinary team, a 680,000-gallon (2,574,080 liter) cistern that collects rainwater that is used for irrigation and 4,000 solar panels. At games, fans who are spotted recycling can be featured on the stadium video board and win a signed jersey. Fullerton said fans seek out the sustainability team in hopes of being spotted.

“Start small and at least start doing something,” is Fullerton’s advice for venues that are interested in becoming more sustainable.

He said it costs about 10 cents per fan who attend events to run the zero waste program.

“In the grand scheme of things, that’s pretty cheap,” he said.

Waste created by tailgating outside the stadium remains a challenge because the parking lots can be outside the scope of the stadium’s waste management program. “It’s really difficult to control what a fan brings with them” to a tailgate, said Fullerton.

Fans can practice sustainability and minimize tailgate waste by packaging food and beverages in reusable containers and placing all waste and recyclables in their corresponding bins, taking public transit and adjusting home thermostats when they leave to save energy and money.

The visibility of stadium sustainability initiatives leads to a sense of group identity and increases the likelihood that fans will adopt that mindset as their own, said Karen Winterich, professor of sustainability and marketing at the Pennsylvania State University.

“One big thing we know about any sort of behavior change, and that includes sustainable behaviors, is that consumers are really motivated by identity, social norms and social pressures,” she said. When everyone puts their can into a stadium recycling bin, it increases the odds they'll do so at home.

Climate change and renewable energy, especially solar and wind, are topics that are highly politicized. “I think it’s really strategic by the NFL … they’re talking about it for the benefits, but not in a polarizing way,” said Winterich. She said a strategy that often works to get people on board with sustainability is highlighting the benefits of on-site energy usage and how the local environment benefits from less pollution, composting and recycling.

NFL Green, the league’s sustainability program, aims to leave ""a green legacy in the communities we visit,” said Anna Isaacson, the league's senior vice president of social responsibility. For major events such as the Super Bowl, NFL Green hosts community feedback sessions that have inspired efforts such as the league financially supporting a coastal wetland project in Louisiana, where the 2025 Super Bowl was held.

The next Super Bowl will be held at the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Some of the stadium’s sustainable initiatives include 1,162 solar panels, a rooftop garden that yields about 10,000 pounds of crops annually, and recycling and composting 70% of all materials.

“The Bay Area is our home and it’s a unique place with tons of natural beauty. So our goal is to keep our community clean, not just for now, but for the future,” said Francine Melendez Hughes, executive vice president and general manager of Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

RadiansPlus Technologies Unveils PSN-DLM: A Breakthrough in Dynamic Load Management Powered by Power System Neutral

Innovative solution eliminates grid upgrade bottlenecks, enabling rapid and equitable adoption of EVs and solar energy without costly infrastructure expansion

By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, PSN-DLM unlocks the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

— Geoffrey Chan

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RadiansPlus Technologies, a pioneer in sustainable grid innovation, today announced the launch of PSN-DLM (Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management), a groundbreaking technology that redefines how electric vehicle (EV) charging and distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems interact with existing grid infrastructure.

As cities worldwide race toward net-zero targets, grid capacity constraints have emerged as a critical barrier to scaling EV charging and solar adoption—especially in high-density urban environments. Traditional approaches rely on expensive, time-consuming grid upgrades or battery energy storage systems (BESS), often passing significant costs onto consumers or taxpayers while generating additional embodied carbon during construction.

Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management (PSN-DLM) changes the game. Built on RadiansPlus’ patented Power System Neutral (PSN) architecture, PSN-DLM intelligently orchestrates real-time energy demand and supply by differentiating between power (instantaneous load) and energy (total consumption over time). The system dynamically manages flexible loads—such as EV charging—and modulates solar export to align with available grid capacity, ensuring seamless integration without overloading substations or feeders.

Key Benefits of Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management:

• Zero Grid Expansion Required: Enables full utilization of existing grid assets, deferring or eliminating the need for costly upgrades.

• 80%+ Cost Savings: Compared to conventional grid reinforcement or BESS deployment.

• Equitable Access: Makes EV charging and solar energy accessible in underserved communities, public housing, and dense urban zones.

• Grid-Friendly Integration: Real-time coordination between EVs, PV systems, and grid constraints ensures stability and maximizes renewable utilization.

• Rapid Deployment: Short certification and installation timelines accelerate time-to-value for charge point operators (CPOs), building owners, and utilities.

“PSN-DLM delivers the ‘friendly handshake’ the energy transition desperately needs—between EVs, solar panels, and the grid,” said Geoffrey Chan, Co-Founder & Technical Director of RadiansPlus Technologies. “By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, we unlock the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

The technology has already been validated across multiple pilot sites in Asia, including public housing estates in Hong Kong and Singapore, commercial hubs like VivoCity Mall, and transportation infrastructure managed by airport authorities. These deployments demonstrate grid utilization improvements of up to 90% and the ability to support EV charging loads up to 200% of original substation capacity—without hardware upgrades.

PSN-DLM is part of RadiansPlus’ integrated “Solution in a Box” offering, compatible with OCPP standards and is preparing for a future where it is ready for integration with BESS and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks. The company is actively engaging with utilities, regulators, CPOs, and real estate developers to scale deployment across Asia and beyond.

The reasonable implication here is that buyers are paying attention to tax credits, and prefer buying when these credits will apply to their purchases.
The takeaway: Expect EV demand to be lower in 2026 than previously expected.
As EV producers, Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian all earn credits under this program.
The elimination of the consumer tax credit will hit EV demand.","Earlier this year, electric car stocks across the board saw sharp declines after the U.S. government revealed that several critical EV subsidies would be eliminated. Since then, however, most of those initial losses have been erased. Yet the effect of these subsidies being eliminated remains.

If you have money invested in Lucid Group (LCID 2.68%), Rivian (RIVN 0.85%), or Tesla (TSLA -1.41%), be sure to understand the two problems below that all three of these automakers will face very soon.

1. Electric car demand may be lower than expected

Governments around the world have been offering incentives that lower the price of EVs for customers since the 1990s. In 2010, the U.S. began offering consumers a tax credit that ranged between $2,500 and $7,500 when buying a new or used electric vehicle. There were rules related to which cars qualified and who exactly could receive the credit. But all in all, these tax credits deployed billions of dollars to lower the upfront cost of buying an electric vehicle.

On Sept. 30, 2025, these tax credits will be formally eliminated. This effectively raises the final cost of an EV by up to $7,500. At a time when nearly 70% of Americans are hoping to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase, the elimination of this subsidy should immediately hit EV demand. Already, we're seeing a small but noticeable bump in EV purchases -- a signal that people who have sat on the fence are buying before the tax credits expire. The reasonable implication here is that buyers are paying attention to tax credits, and prefer buying when these credits will apply to their purchases.

The takeaway: Expect EV demand to be lower in 2026 than previously expected. To counteract this, EV makers may be forced to cut prices, stoking demand, but reducing gross profits. Critically, both Lucid and Rivian expect to start production on vehicles with prices under $50,000 over the next six to 24 months. These budget vehicles are intended to massively increase their total addressable markets. Should those newer models have qualified, they will now be missing a key subsidy that would have made them even more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.

2. This little-known multi-billion-dollar subsidy won't exist in 2026

Many EV investors are already aware of the U.S. tax credits that are set to expire at the end of September. However, most don't realize that there's another program about to be axed that is equally valuable: CAFE regulatory credits, which are credits earned by auto manufacturers that exceed fuel economy standards.

As EV producers, Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian all earn credits under this program. These companies then sell these credits to other automakers that would otherwise face fines for not producing enough low-emission vehicles. Because these credits are earned automatically, they can be sold at essentially 100% profit margins.

The value of this little-understood program is immense. Tesla routinely earned billions of dollars per year from this program, accounting for 10% to 30% of its gross profit. Rivian has already told investors that it wouldn't realize $100 million in revenue from the sale of its credits, since these credits are no longer worth anything. Fines for non-compliance have been eliminated, taking away any incentive for competing automakers to value and purchase these credits. Lucid, too, has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in ""free"" profit from this program.

The elimination of the consumer tax credit will hit EV demand. But the elimination of automotive regulatory credits like this will have an equally damaging effect. Rivian and Lucid are still struggling for profitability, and now they will lose a highly profitable revenue source. Tesla, meanwhile, has benefited the most from this program on a sheer volume basis. The elimination of these credits may not make headlines, but it poses problems for all three companies in 2026 and beyond.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835557/gettyimages-152404829-1200x960-4134ff9.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 14:01:15.816233

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

""This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,"" Symons said. ""Whittling away at EPA's ability to do its job.""

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

QUITO (Reuters) -Ecuador’s government has revoked the environmental license granted to Canadian mining company DPM Metals for the development of Loma Larga, a gold project in an environmentally sensitive area, the government said on Saturday.

The decision follows strong opposition from residents and authorities in the Azuay province, where the Loma Larga project is located. They argue that its development would affect the Quimsacocha water reserve, posing significant health risks to local communities.

Ecuador’s Environment and Energy Ministry said in a statement the decision was the result of technical reports submitted by local authorities in Cuenca and Azuay that are responsible for local drinking water and irrigation systems.

“The national government reaffirms its commitment to the rights of nature, the defense of water sources, and, under the precautionary principle, the protection of the health and well-being of the people of Cuenca and Azuay,” it said.

DPM, which acquired the project in 2021, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Loma Larga project was expected to receive investments of $419 million for an average annual production of about 200,000 ounces of gold during its first five years of operation, according to DPM.

In August, the Ecuadorean government had already suspended activities related to the project until the company released an environmental management plan, despite having granted it a license a month earlier to begin construction.

Despite having significant gold and copper deposits, Ecuador’s recent legal rulings and local opposition has often halted mining projects. Currently, only two mining companies operate in the country.

The Quimsacocha Reserve spans more than 3,200 hectares and encompasses the Andean “paramo” ecosystem.

Its springs form one of the main water sources in the South American country. The company had pledged to implement efficient and responsible environmental management in the area.

Globally known for confectionery and pet food, Mars is also recognised for its integration of sustainable practices across its operations and supply chains.

Collaborating with Enel, the company is taking significant steps towards reducing its carbon footprint through its Renewable Acceleration programme.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars says.

“For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""

This collaboration focuses on involving the entire value chain, aiming for a comprehensive shift to renewables, from sourcing to transportation.

Innovation in energy usage

The clean energy shift at Mars extends to its supply chain activities, from the farms producing ingredients through to the trucks delivering products.

""[The partnership with Enel] means sourcing renewable electricity to cover everything from the farms that grow our ingredients to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy their favourite Mars products, like Ben’s Original and SNICKERS Ice Cream, or at their BANFIELD veterinarian’s office,"" says Alastair Child, Chief Sustainability Officer at Mars.

""By implementing this strategy, we could cut around three million tons of carbon emissions from the Mars full value chain, amounting to an estimated 10% of our current total footprint. This is a huge unlock for decarbonisation and we’re just getting started.""

Mars has committed to renewable electricity as a cost-effective and publicly supported solution for decarbonisation.

Building a sustainable future

The first substantial contract under this programme is with Enel North America, marking Mars' largest engagement in clean power agreements.

“Renewable Acceleration is a bold initiative to support the buildout of more clean energy capacity, which we know is among the fastest and most economical ways to decarbonise,” adds Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Mars is raising the bar for corporate sustainability strategies, taking a comprehensive and direct approach to addressing emissions across its entire value chain. Enel is proud to partner with Mars in launching this new program.”

Through Mars' global renewable energy contracts, the company is working towards making its operations more sustainable and encouraging other businesses to adopt similar strategies.

By forging multiple supplier relationships, Mars enhances its energy resilience and progresses towards its decarbonisation objectives faster.

The initial agreements with Enel are set to produce 1.8TWh annually, contributing to a significant reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.

Such initiatives not only transform Mars' supply chain but also set a precedent for others in the sector to follow suit.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/62a82981ab16dd951068ad0990034462:bb2455a98e9e7bd321a36d36f148c8ad/aurora-solar-farm-dual-use-solar-min.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 17:03:05.208711

It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association is a collective of government, tribal, labor, energy, research, nonprofit, and private sector stakeholders aimed at creating a hydrogen center in the Pacific Northwest region.
“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt.
“Cutting these funds delays the inevitable as clean energy trends toward hydrogen production for industrial use.","Local lawmakers weighed in on the Trump Administration’s cuts to approximately $1 billion worth of federal funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), which supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon.

The H2Hubs program was established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States. These networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure help accelerate the use of hydrogen as clean energy and work toward achieving the goal of a 100 percent clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The cuts include the elimination of more than 10,000 jobs across the region (mainly in rural areas).

In Washington State these cuts include:

• Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102,797,603

• Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157,342,270

• Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce Counties): $11,800,670

• Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36,385,400

The White House Office of Management and Budget announced the cuts on Wednesday, October 1.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a collective of projects aimed at green hydrogen ecosystem spurring billions of dollars of infrastructure investment to provide alternatives to fossil fuels, has been years development and won a highly competitive national competition to receive the roughly $1 billion federal funding award.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) choose the Pacific Northwest Hub to demonstrate how clean hydrogen generated from hydropower could be utilized by a range of industries and transportation sectors.

In October 2023, the DOE designated PNWH2 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation, focused on harnessing the Pacific Northwest’s abundant and clean hydropower supplies to produce hydrogen through hydrolysis.

In July 2024, DOE announced that PNWH2 received Phase 1 award status and would receive an initial amount of up to $27.5 million to fund initial planning, permitting, and analysis activities to ensure that the overall Hub concept is technologically and financially viable, with input from relevant local stakeholders. Besides the $1 billion in federal cost-sharing, the Hub expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local investments.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association is a collective of government, tribal, labor, energy, research, nonprofit, and private sector stakeholders aimed at creating a hydrogen center in the Pacific Northwest region. This public-private partnership includes leaders from the Washington State Department of Commerce, the Oregon Department of Energy, Amazon, Washington State University, and others.

What local lawmakers are saying:

Following the federal government’s decision on Wednesday, October 1, several Democratic law makers in Washington weighed in on the matter and how it would impact clean energy efforts in Washington.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” said U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage. This politically motivated claw back of funds will result in significant job losses and increased utility bills in our state,” said Congresswoman Suzan DelBene. “The President of the United States is playing politics by targeting states that did not vote for him. I will fight this decision to save Washington jobs and avoid another hike on our energy bills.”

“The Trump administration is raising the cost of living by cancelling local clean energy projects. The Department of Energy is clawing back a billion dollars in funding for Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which has bipartisan support and is set to create thousands of good-paying jobs while decreasing energy prices across our region,” said Congressman Rick Larsen. “Cutting these funds delays the inevitable as clean energy trends toward hydrogen production for industrial use. The President is targeting his political opponents with these cuts, but the economic hurt of these decisions will be felt by everyone in our communities regardless of their politics. I will fight to reverse these cuts.”

The Minnesota Department of Commerce was also on the list.
All of the states seeing funding rescinded, including Minnesota, were states won by Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.","In the hours after the federal government shut down on Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it would cancel nearly $8 billion in climate projects in more than a dozen states, including Minnesota.

The number of grants impacted totals $645 million in Minnesota, according to a statement from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith's office.

Among the projects her office said were affected include $464 million to build new electrical transmission lines connecting Minnesota and other Midwest states, $50 million to upgrade an electrical transmission line between Minnesota and North Dakota, and $1.7 million for research to ensure solar projects save money.

The U.S. Department of Energy provided WCCO a list of the funding recipients across all 16 states expected to see the cuts. Xcel Energy is among them. A spokesperson said the utility company is still evaluating the impact, but it did receive confirmation that a future iron-air battery plant to store renewable energy like solar and wind in Becker, Minnesota, had been canceled. That award totaled $70 million.

In an interview on CNN, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the decisions about where to slash the grants were made over the last few months, even though the announcement came Wednesday, the day the first government shutdown since 2018 began.

""A team of seven or eight people have evaluated over 2,400 projects on business conditions and whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not,"" Wright said.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce was also on the list. A spokeswoman said the agency did not get any official notice from the Department of Energy about the termination of funding, but that if it is true, it would ""represent an unprecedented and politically motivated breach of federal law and funding norms.""

""Without these investments, Minnesota could face higher energy prices, slower infrastructure development, and increased burdens on low- and middle-income households — all while demand for clean, affordable energy continues to grow,"" a statement from the state's commerce department said.

U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, the Republican majority whip who represents Minnesota's Sixth District, told reporters Friday that the administration has to make tough decisions during the government shutdown and blamed Democrats for letting it happen.

The GOP-led House approved a continuing resolution in September to keep funding at current levels. But both parties are at an impasse over a funding measure in the Senate, where there is a 60-vote threshold to move forward. Republicans have 53 votes in the chamber.

Emmer suggested the funding could be restored when the shutdown ends.

""They're going to have to put the American people first. If they do that, I think Minnesotans will be pleased, and a lot of these projects will be back on the board,"" he said.

All of the states seeing funding rescinded, including Minnesota, were states won by Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, called it ""outrageous.""

""This whole idea that they see states as Democrats and Republicans, or they see areas as red or blue, is simply the most egregious violation of their oath. You have a responsibility to give your best for people who vote against you,"" Walz said Thursday.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/03/3568f228-1a29-45d0-8c06-c7d628bc30e8/thumbnail/1200x630/7fa2c645c1f208d9f8f8fb426742634f/6p-pkg-energy-projects-cut-wcco8vq9.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 18:00:45.648951

Now, some technicians joke that every certificate is another step down the wage ladder, and EV training may be the steepest drop yet.

In a viral Facebook Reel that has been viewed more than 300,000 times, creator and lube tech The POV Mechanic (@thepovmechanic) doesn’t seem optimistic that his career trajectory will improve after becoming certified to work on electric vehicles. “I'll be replacing batteries and electric drive motors in about a month, pray for me,” he notes in the caption to the clip.

Payments Out Of Step

The irony is hard to miss. In many trades, expanding your credentials is supposed to open doors to better pay and more advanced work. However, the frustration evident in comment threads under that Reel suggests that many EV-certified mechanics feel the opposite has happened. One technician laments, “The more you learn the less you earn.” Another adds, “Learning how to use a lab scope was a bad idea.” Several blame warranty jobs and diagnostic-heavy work areas as being more common with EV service, which they say drives down their effective earnings.

To understand why these complaints resonate so widely, one must first examine the way many auto technicians are paid: the flat-rate or flat-hour model. Instead of being compensated for the time spent, technicians are paid according to pre-set time allowances for specific jobs (the “book time”), regardless of how long the work actually takes. When performing warranty work, this time the manufacturer often dictates allowances and tends to be more restrictive than comparable customer-pay estimates. Under those constraints, a complex EV task such as a battery replacement, module diagnostics or software calibration may last far longer than the allotted time, but the technician is paid no more.

The problem reflects a lag in compensation models keeping pace with evolving vehicle architectures. As vehicles become more software-intensive and electrified, the nature of repair shifts: fewer oil changes and brake jobs, more battery, electric drive, wiring and software work. Yet many dealerships and shops still rely on flat-rate systems built for mechanical, repeatable labor, which penalize time-intensive, variable or diagnostic tasks.

But some mechanics do report success. One commenter, Jake Casto, said EVs are “clean, easy, and … pay more.” Others mention employers who place higher value on EV skills and reward accordingly. There are service centers at EV brands and specialized independent shops that offer competitive wages to attract certified techs, capitalizing on the shortage of qualified EV repair professionals.

EV Techs Are Badly Needed

Meanwhile, the industry is keenly aware that demand for qualified technicians is rising.

According to the TechForce Foundation’s recent Supply & Demand reports, the U.S. will need roughly 795,000 new transportation technicians over the next five years. Their 2024 report suggests that growth in technician employment is outpacing the general U.S. labor force, yet the gulf between demand and supply remains crucial. In fact, in late 2024 TechForce adjusted its estimate further upward: It now expects nearly 971,000 total technician roles across automotive, diesel, collision and aviation to need filling through 2028. The automotive sector alone remains under pressure even as more graduates enter the workforce.

If EVs require less routine mechanical maintenance (for example, no oil changes, fewer fluid flushes, fewer moving parts), their part of the repair cake shrinks. That limits volume opportunities for work. Indeed, one of TechForce’s own methodology footnotes says that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have lower scheduled maintenance costs per mile compared to gas-powered vehicles. In other words, fewer routine maintenance tasks mean fewer guaranteed hours across the board.

So, while the need for specialists rises, the nature of the work means that many tasks are one-off, diagnostic or warranty-related—categories that are poorly compensated under traditional flat-rate systems. That creates a financial squeeze for the very mechanics being trained to support the shift. As one industry article puts it: “Flat-rate technicians have been forced to cut corners” to focus on completing as many jobs as possible, which can reduce collaboration and overall customer experience.

Pressure for regulatory and legislative change is already bubbling. In New York State, a new law aims to close the two-tier compensation gap by requiring that warranty and recall labor be compensated at the same labor time allowances as those used for non-warranty work. If that reform spreads, it could realign incentives for technicians working under warranty schedules in EV-centric shops.

The crux of the issue is this: EV training is neither inherently bad nor a bad idea. The issue is the mismatch between evolving technical complexity and antiquated pay models. Techs are becoming better educated, more specialized and more capable, and yet the system still rewards them based on a clockwork grid that assumes repetitive mechanical labor.

In the end, the mechanic who quips, “I get my EV certification just to lose money,” may not be joking until compensation evolves.

The post Former Tesla exec sees continued growth for EVs; Ford's CEO warns of a collapse appeared first on Invezz","A high-stakes and deeply divided debate has erupted at the highest levels of the auto industry, as two of its most influential figures offer starkly opposing visions for the future of the electric vehicle market in a world without subsidies.

The fierce war of words, sparked by the recent death of the $7,500 federal tax credit, pits the bullish optimism of a former Tesla executive against the dire warnings of Ford’s CEO, a clash of perspectives that will have profound implications for the future of American transportation.

The bull case: ‘the market’s established’

On one side of the divide is Jon McNeill, a former Tesla president of global sales and a current GM board member.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he projected a calm confidence, arguing that the US electric vehicle market is now mature enough to stand on its own two feet.

He pointed to Europe as a powerful case study, noting that when countries like Germany rolled back their own subsidies a few years ago, the EV market “surprisingly … continued to grow.”

McNeill believes the US is poised for a similar outcome. “The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.

He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market. When combined with hybrids, he noted, one out of every four cars sold in the US is now electrified.

The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’

On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.

Speaking at a summit in Detroit, he took a virtually opposite and far more pessimistic tack, predicting that the death of the $7,500 consumer incentive is a “game-changer” that will cut the EV industry in half.

While he believes EVs will remain a “vibrant industry,” he also stated it’s “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” projecting a steep drop in EV market share from its current 10 to 12 percent down to just 5 percent.

“The customers are pesky,” Farley said, delivering a blunt and sobering dose of reality.

“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

The X-Factor: a car that powers your house

But there is another, powerful X-factor in this debate, a technological evolution that could fundamentally reshape the value proposition of owning an EV: the car that can power your house.

McNeill argued that the emerging trend of “bidirectional” charging, which allows an EV to push energy back into the grid or directly into a home, will be a powerful driver of future growth.

He shared a personal example, stating that his Silverado EV can power his entire house for two weeks, completely eliminating the need for a separate, noisy generator.

He revealed that his local utility has already offered him a “big break on my utility bills” in exchange for access to just 20 percent of his vehicle’s battery.

On this point, Farley actually agreed, seeing a bright future for “partial electrification.” “We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said.

While the two titans may disagree on the immediate future, they both see a world where the line between a vehicle and a home power plant is beginning to blur, a technological shift that could prove to be the most powerful incentive of all.

Founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903, the company revolutionized manufacturing with the moving assembly line and has since diversified its offerings under the Ford and Lincoln brands. Today, Ford stands as the sixth-largest automaker globally by vehicle production in 2022 and the second-largest American-based automaker, behind General Motors.

Ford is currently undergoing a significant strategic transformation, encapsulated in its ""Ford+"" plan. This initiative reorganizes its operations into three distinct units: Ford Blue (internal combustion engine vehicles), Ford Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial vehicles and services). This restructuring aims to accelerate innovation, enhance customer experience, and optimize profitability across its diverse product lines.

For investors, Ford presents a complex but compelling narrative. The company's stock often trades at a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to pure-play EV competitors, appealing to value investors, and offers an enticing dividend yield exceeding 6%. The robust and consistently profitable Ford Pro commercial segment is a major draw, providing a stable and expanding revenue stream. However, the substantial and ongoing losses in the Ford Model e division (projected up to $5.5 billion in 2025), coupled with a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio and a low net margin, present notable concerns. Analysts currently hold a mixed sentiment, with a consensus rating of ""Reduce"" or ""Hold,"" suggesting potential downside from current stock prices. This article will delve into Ford's multifaceted operations, financial health, strategic direction, and market position to provide a comprehensive analysis for investors.

2. Historical Background

The story of Ford Motor Company is synonymous with the dawn of the automotive age and the advent of modern manufacturing. Henry Ford, a visionary born in 1863, harbored an early passion for mechanics, culminating in the completion of his first experimental car, the ""Quadricycle,"" in 1896. After initial unsuccessful ventures, Ford, alongside coal dealer Alexander Y. Malcomson and other investors, officially incorporated the Ford Motor Company on June 16, 1903, in a converted factory in Detroit, Michigan.

The company's early years saw a range of models, but it was the Model T, introduced in October 1908, that truly revolutionized transportation. Designed to be simple, sturdy, and, crucially, affordable, the Model T became known as ""the car for the masses."" To meet overwhelming demand, Henry Ford pioneered the moving assembly line on December 1, 1913, at the Highland Park factory. This innovation drastically cut production time from over 12 hours to just one hour and 33 minutes, a method that became globally known as ""Fordism."" By 1914, Ford was producing more cars than all other automakers combined, and the price of a Model T plummeted from $850 to less than $300 by 1925, making car ownership accessible to millions. In 1914, Ford also introduced the revolutionary $5-a-day wage for an eight-hour workday, doubling existing rates and boosting the purchasing power of its workers.

Ford's global expansion began early with Ford of Canada in 1904 and its first overseas branch in Paris by 1908. The company further expanded its portfolio by acquiring the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, entering the luxury market. After selling over 15 million units, Model T production ceased in 1927, making way for the Model A. In 1938, the Mercury brand was established to fill the gap between Ford and Lincoln.

A pivotal transformation occurred in 1956 when Ford Motor Company went public, listing its common stock on the NYSE on March 7, 1956. This was the largest IPO in American history at the time, driven by the need to diversify the Ford Foundation's portfolio. Despite public ownership, the Ford family retained significant control through special Class B shares, holding 40% of the voting rights, a structure that persists today.

Under Henry Ford II, the company modernized and introduced iconic models like the Thunderbird (1954) and the Mustang (1964). Ford diversified through acquisitions like Jaguar (1989), Land Rover (2000), and Volvo (1999). However, the 2008-2010 automotive crisis led to a major restructuring under CEO Alan Mulally's ""One Ford Plan."" This involved divesting luxury brands and refocusing on core Ford and Lincoln brands, emphasizing product development and efficiency.

More recently, Ford has made a significant strategic shift towards electrification and sustainable mobility. In 2018, the company announced it would largely cease passenger car production in North America, except for the Mustang, to focus on trucks, SUVs, and crossovers. Today, with substantial investments in EVs like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, Ford is committed to adapting to evolving consumer preferences and global market demands, including enhancing its digital sales platforms and integrating mobility services.

3. Business Model

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company operates with a dynamic business model, strategically segmented into three distinct, yet interconnected, operational units: Ford Blue, Model e, and Ford Pro. This structure, central to Ford's ""Ford+"" plan, aims to foster innovation, enhance customer engagement, and optimize profitability across its diverse product lines and services.

Revenue Sources

Ford's primary revenue streams are derived from:

Automotive Manufacturing and Sales: This encompasses the sale of a comprehensive range of vehicles, including traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, trucks, SUVs, commercial vehicles, and an expanding portfolio of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids. The truck and commercial segments, particularly Ford Pro, are significant drivers of revenue growth.

Financial Services: Through Ford Motor Credit Company, Ford provides financing, leasing, and insurance solutions to a vast customer base, representing a growing and strategically important revenue stream. In Q1 2025, Ford Credit contributed $1.7 billion in earnings before taxes.

Software and Connected Services: Particularly within Ford Pro, the company is generating increasing revenue from paid software subscriptions and integrated digital services. Ford Pro Intelligence paid software subscriptions grew by approximately 30% year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching about 815,000 active subscriptions.

Primary Product Lines

Ford's business is organized around three customer-centric segments:

Ford Blue: This division focuses on strengthening Ford's iconic ICE and hybrid vehicle portfolio. It aims to drive growth and profitability from established models such as the F-Series, Ranger, Maverick, Bronco, Explorer, and Mustang, while also delivering new, connected driving experiences. Ford Blue is considered the ""profit engine"" of Ford, generating significant earnings to fund future innovations. In Q1 2025, Ford Blue generated $21 billion in revenue.

Model e: Dedicated to inventing and scaling breakthrough electric vehicles and developing embedded software that defines always-on digital experiences for all customers.

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company and the broader automotive industry are navigating a period of profound transformation, shaped by evolving market trends, significant macroeconomic pressures, persistent supply chain challenges, and inherent cyclical effects.

Automotive Industry and Market Trends

The global push towards electric vehicles (EVs) remains a central theme, though its trajectory and profitability are undergoing recalibration. Ford's electrified vehicle sales (hybrids, plug-ins, all-electrics) reached 85,789 units in Q3 2025, a 19.8% year-over-year increase, representing 15.7% of its total sales. The Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning continue to perform well. However, the EV market is experiencing a ""recalibration,"" with a slowdown in investment and consumer demand in key regions. Ford CEO Jim Farley suggests U.S. EV sales could fall to 5% of the market if tax credits expire and emissions rules relax. In response, Ford is adjusting its EV strategy to focus on lower-cost vehicles and a new universal EV platform, while prioritizing commercial vehicles, pickup trucks, and SUVs, and realigning battery sourcing to reduce costs.

Beyond electrification, Ford is heavily invested in autonomous driving technology, focusing on Level 3 systems through Latitude AI. Connected car technologies and digital services, such as Ford Pro Intelligence (815,000 active subscribers, up 30% year-over-year) and BlueCruise hands-free driving (exceeding 7 million cumulative hours), are significant growth areas.

Ford's traditional strengths in trucks and SUVs continue to drive sales. The F-Series remains America's best-selling truck, with strong sales in Q3 2025. Models like the Expedition and Bronco also posted robust sales. Ford's overall U.S. sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year in Q3 2025, marking seven consecutive months of gains.

Macro Drivers

Several macroeconomic factors are impacting Ford:

Interest Rates and Inflation: Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs for Ford and impact consumer financing, potentially dampening vehicle demand. High inflation also increases Ford's production costs and reduces consumer purchasing power.

Tariffs and Trade Policy: The U.S. government's 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles and components is a critical issue for Ford in 2025, potentially increasing production costs by an estimated $3,000 per new car. Ford anticipates a full-year net hit of about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating earnings due to tariffs. The company is mitigating this by reshoring production and diversifying suppliers.

Economic Growth and Consumer Spending: Global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak (2.7% in 2025) due to economic pressures. Economic downturns and high unemployment negatively impact Ford's sales. However, Ford's inventory data suggests robust underlying demand.

Regulatory Changes: Evolving emissions policies and environmental regulations continue to push the industry towards electrification, requiring significant investment from Ford.

Supply Chain Issues

Supply chain disruptions remain a critical challenge:

Semiconductor Shortages: A potential shortage in mature nodes is anticipated in late 2025 or 2026, as investment shifts to advanced nodes. The overall shortage is expected to persist for three to five years.

Raw Material Availability and Costs: Volatility in raw material prices and availability, particularly for rare earth magnets, has impacted Ford's production, leading to plant shutdowns (e.g., Chicago Assembly plant for 2025 Ford Explorer). Rising energy costs also increase manufacturing expenses.

Logistics and Diversification: Geopolitical tensions and natural disasters exacerbate problems. Ford is diversifying its supplier network to reduce reliance on single regions.

Labor Shortages: A persistent shortage of skilled labor in the automotive supply chain hinders production.

Cyclical Effects

The automotive industry is inherently cyclical:

Industry Position: As of Q3 2025, Ford is performing strongly with seven consecutive months of U.S. sales gains.

Economic Sensitivity: Ford's financial health is sensitive to economic downturns. Analysts note a significant decline in profitability of Ford's conventional car segment in 2025 due to inventory stocking.

EV Market Influence: The expected slowdown in EV adoption and expiration of federal tax credits could negatively influence the market in the short term.

Inventory Levels: New car inventory is gradually normalizing, which can stabilize prices, though supply chain pressures might still delay certain models.

Overall, Ford is demonstrating resilience through growing sales in its traditional and electrified segments. However, it faces significant headwinds from macroeconomic pressures, tariffs, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities, and the uncertain trajectory of the EV market. Strategic adjustments in its EV portfolio and supply chain management are crucial for navigating these complex trends.

10. Risks and Challenges

Ford Motor Company, as of October 4, 2025, is confronting a multifaceted array of operational, regulatory, and market risks, compounded by ongoing controversies. The company's ambitious pivot towards electric vehicles (EVs) is a central theme, presenting both opportunities and significant financial and operational hurdles.

Operational Risks

Supply Chain Issues:

Ford continues to grapple with supply chain disruptions. Outdated IT systems among some suppliers contribute to miscommunications and increased costs. The highly globalized supply chain for vehicles like the F-150 makes it vulnerable to external shocks, with only a third of its components manufactured in the U.S. or Canada. A critical shortage of rare earth magnets, for instance, led to a seven-day shutdown of the Chicago Assembly plant in June 2025, impacting 2025 Ford Explorer production. Ford is actively working to streamline supply chains and leverage economies of scale.

Recalls and Quality Control:

Ford is experiencing a significant ""quality crisis,"" with a record number of recalls in 2025. By mid-September 2025, Ford had issued 88 safety recalls, surpassing its total for all of 2024, and reaching 116 recalls by October 2025, making it the highest number of recalls in a single year by a major automaker. These recalls cover a wide range of issues, from electronic and mechanical defects to software-related problems. For example, a recall of 355,656 F-Series trucks was due to a ""memory protection fault"" in the instrument cluster software. These quality issues are costly, estimated at upwards of $4.8 billion annually, or approximately $6.5 billion CAD. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has acknowledged that fixing quality is a top priority but will take several years. The company has implemented measures such as delaying model launches for extra quality checks, hiring specialists, and benchmarking Toyota's processes.

Regulatory Risks

Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The potential introduction of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada poses a significant threat to Ford's supply chain and profitability, as these regions are crucial for North American production. These tariffs could add approximately $400 to the production cost of each F-150. Ford anticipates a net negative impact of about $1.5 billion on its adjusted EBIT in 2025 due to tariffs, even after mitigation efforts. Persisting tariff impacts would necessitate ""major strategy shifts."" Broader U.S. tariffs on imports and China's export restrictions on critical minerals further complicate sourcing and increase costs.

Emissions and Safety Regulations:

Government regulations related to environmental improvements and public safety are a constant threat. Ford must continuously comply with new regulations, which often require significant investment in new technologies. Shifting emissions policies also create long-term planning challenges.

Labor Relations:

Strong labor unions represent a potential risk for Ford, as labor negotiations and strikes can significantly disrupt operations and increase costs.

Controversies

Shareholder Investigation:

An ongoing shareholder investigation poses potential legal and financial risks for Ford, demanding transparent management.

Legal Issues from Recalls:

The current surge in recalls could lead to further civil lawsuits and fines, as Ford has previously been penalized for not recalling vehicles swiftly enough.

Market Risks

EV Profitability Challenges:

Ford's ""Model e"" electric vehicle division is a major drag on the company's overall financial performance, with significant and anticipated ongoing losses (projected $5-5.5 billion in 2025). These losses are attributed to high development and manufacturing costs, aggressive pricing strategies in the EV market, and expensive battery components. Ford's ""Gen 1"" EVs are not yet profitable. While Ford is adjusting its EV strategy to focus on cost-cutting and lower-cost vehicles, achieving breakeven by 2026 is viewed as increasingly optimistic by some.

Competition:

Ford faces fierce competition from both traditional automakers (GM, Toyota) and new EV players (Tesla, Rivian, Chinese manufacturers). This intense competition contributes to pricing pressures and challenges Ford's ability to maintain its innovative position.

Economic Slowdown and Interest Rates:

Sluggish consumer sentiment and economic slowdowns pose a risk to Ford's sales and market share. Rising interest rates make car loans more expensive. While auto loan rates have seen some decline, a significant drop needed to spur the market is unlikely. Ford has offered aggressive financing deals, but critics warn that offering lower rates to subprime borrowers could lead to higher default risks.

Declining EV Demand (Post-Incentive):

Ford CEO Jim Farley predicts a significant decline in demand for fully electric vehicles in the U.S. due to the cessation of federal incentives, potentially halving the EV sector's market share. This creates uncertainty for Ford's factories and battery plants built for higher demand. In response, Ford is pivoting its strategy towards hybrid models, which are currently outperforming EVs in profitability.

Inventory Management:

Ford faced high inventory levels of 2024 model year vehicles in early 2025, leading to 100 to 130 days of inventory by mid-2025. This overcorrection in production necessitates incentives and discounts to clear older inventory.

In conclusion, Ford is at a critical juncture, balancing its EV transition with persistent quality issues, complex supply chain vulnerabilities, and a highly competitive market. The profitability of its EV segment remains a significant concern, while the high frequency and cost of recalls continue to strain its financial health and brand reputation. Regulatory changes, particularly tariffs and the winding down of EV incentives, further complicate its strategic planning and market outlook.

12. Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is experiencing a divergence in investor sentiment, with Wall Street analysts generally maintaining a cautious stance while options trading and retail investor chatter signal a more bullish outlook. Despite recent stock price increases, analysts' average price targets suggest a potential downside.

Wall Street Analyst Ratings and Price Targets

Wall Street analysts currently hold a consensus rating of ""Reduce"" or ""Hold"" on Ford (F) stock. Across approximately seventeen research firms, the breakdown typically shows:

Sell ratings: 3 analysts

Hold ratings: 11-12 analysts

Buy ratings: 2-4 analysts

The average twelve-month price objective among brokers ranges from approximately $10.57 to $11.00. This average target implies a potential downside of 10.0% to 15.94% from Ford's current trading price, which was around $12.22-$12.28 in early October.

Recent individual analyst updates reflect this mixed perspective:

Wells Fargo maintained ""Underweight"" but raised target from $8.00 to $10.00 (Oct 3, 2025).

Goldman Sachs maintained ""Neutral"" and increased target from $11.00 to $12.00 (Sep 29, 2025).

Jefferies Financial Group maintained ""Underperform"" (Sell), raising target from $8.00 to $9.00 (Aug 11, 2025).

J.P. Morgan maintained ""Overweight"" (Buy), boosting target from $12.00 to $13.00 (Jul 21, 2025).

The highest observed price target is $16.00, while the lowest is $7.00.

Hedge Fund Activities and Institutional Investor Sentiment

Institutional investors and hedge funds collectively own a significant portion of Ford's stock, approximately 58.74% to 61.62%. Recent activities indicate active interest, though with mixed signals:

In Q3 2025, several financial firms made new investments in Ford stock. Churchill Management Corp, for instance, acquired a $10.3 million stake in Q2 2025.

In Q1 2025, there was substantial hedge fund activity with 756 institutional investors adding shares and 786 decreasing their positions. Notable increases included Vanguard Group Inc., Pacer Advisors, Inc., and Blackrock, Inc.

While institutional ownership is strong, Ford's valuation metrics, such as a P/E ratio near its 2-year high and a P/S ratio suggesting potential overvaluation, lead some to a ""Hold"" position. The Altman Z-Score also places Ford in a ""distress zone,"" suggesting potential financial instability.

Retail Investor Chatter and Sentiment

Retail investor sentiment, particularly in options trading, appears notably more bullish compared to the cautious stance of many Wall Street analysts.

There has been a ""dramatic surge"" in call options volume, a direct indicator of bullish bets, with a recent jump of 154% above the daily average. This suggests a segment of the market is positioning for a significant near-term rally.

On September 26, 2025, Ford saw a significant increase in options trading, with call volume dominating over put volume, leading to a low put/call ratio and highlighting stronger demand for call options.

On platforms like Stocktwits, sentiment remained ""bullish"" with a surge in message volume following a stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 report. Many retail investors ""cheered the earnings beat,"" hoping the stock would climb past $10.

Overall, technical indicators and short-selling analysis also present a positive outlook from some retail-focused analyses, categorizing Ford as a ""Strong Buy candidate"" based on technical signals and decreasing short-sell activity.

In summary, while professional analysts exhibit caution with a ""Reduce"" or ""Hold"" consensus and average price targets suggesting a slight downside, institutional investors show significant ownership and some recent buying, and retail investors, particularly in the options market, are displaying a notably bullish sentiment for Ford Motor Company as of October 4, 2025.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Ford Motor Company is operating within a complex and rapidly shifting landscape of regulatory changes, government policies, and significant geopolitical dynamics as of October 4, 2025. These factors profoundly influence the company's electric vehicle (EV) strategy, supply chains, and international trade operations, particularly regarding tariffs and global trade policies.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Changes

Electric Vehicle (EV) Regulations and Incentives:

United States:

Federal EV Tax Credit (Section 30D): The popular $7,500 federal EV tax credit was officially set to expire on September 30, 2025. However, Ford, along with General Motors, has implemented workarounds through leasing programs. These programs allow their financing units to acquire eligible EVs before the deadline and then lease them to customers, effectively extending the tax credit's benefit through at least December 31, 2025.

New Tax Deduction: A new policy, effective October 1, 2025, introduces an annual tax deduction of up to $10,000 for auto loan interest on financed, U.S.-assembled electric vehicles.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Sourcing Requirements: The IRA continues to tighten eligibility for EV tax credits based on critical mineral and battery component sourcing. For 2025, 60% of the value of critical minerals in an EV battery must be extracted or processed in the U.S. or a free trade agreement country, or be recycled in North America, to qualify for the full credit. Crucially, starting in 2025, eligible clean vehicles cannot contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a ""foreign entity of concern"" (FEOC). This poses a significant challenge given China's dominance in midstream processing of these minerals. Currently, only select Ford F-150 Lightning trims (Flash, Lariat, and XLT) are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, provided they meet MSRP and income thresholds. Other Ford EV models like the Mustang Mach-E and Escape PHEV are largely ineligible due to battery sourcing laws.

Market Impact: Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has expressed concerns about the impact of these changes, predicting that U.S. EV sales could potentially fall by half after the expiration of the current federal tax credit, particularly for higher-priced models, even with EPA orders to roll back some greenhouse gas emissions targets.

European Union:

CO2 Emission Standards: From January 1, 2025, stricter CO2 emission performance standards take effect. New cars and vans registered in the EU must emit 15% less CO2 on average compared to 2021 targets, equating to 93.6 g CO2/km for cars and 153.9 g CO2/km for vans.

Compliance Flexibility: The European Commission introduced a temporary flexibility measure in April 2025, allowing manufacturers to meet CO2 targets for 2025-2027 based on a three-year average, rather than annually. This provides some leeway for compliance, with financial penalties for non-adherence.

Incentives for ZLEVs: To encourage the transition, manufacturers receive emission credits if zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) constitute more than 25% of their total sales.

Euro 7 Emissions Standard: The new Euro 7 emissions regulation is scheduled to come into force in 2025, replacing the existing Euro 6 standards.

Tariffs and International Trade Policies

U.S. Tariffs:

Automotive Tariffs: As of May 2025, a 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts not manufactured in the U.S. remains fully enforced, in addition to a standard 2.5% base tariff for modern vehicles. This policy, enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act by President Trump, aims to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Broader Import Tariffs: A universal 10% tariff on almost all U.S. imports took effect on April 5, 2025. Following a retaliatory spiral, U.S. tariffs on many Chinese goods escalated to 145%, with China imposing duties as high as 125% on American imports by April 2025.

Steel, Aluminum, and Copper Tariffs: Tariffs on these materials were raised to 50%.

Impact on Ford: Ford anticipates a net negative impact of approximately $1.5 billion on its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2025 due to these tariffs, even after implementing strategic measures like using ""bonded transportation"" and recalibrating import strategies to offset $1 billion. The company ceased U.S. exports to China to manage these logistics. Ford, like other major U.S. automakers, has largely absorbed tariff costs on imported steel, aluminum, and auto parts to maintain production and sales volumes, impacting profitability.

North American Trade: In January 2025, President Trump announced broad tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which threaten the highly integrated North American auto supply chain. Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis have lobbied for exemptions, warning that these tariffs could harm American companies.

China's Export Restrictions: China has imposed and expanded export restrictions on critical minerals and high-tech materials crucial for EV components, including rare earth metals (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium), permanent magnets, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite. These restrictions create supply chain bottlenecks, increase material costs, and could delay EV production globally.

Geopolitical Risks and Opportunities

US-China Rivalry and EV Supply Chains: The geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China has intensified, directly impacting the EV industry's supply chains. U.S. regulations now deny EV tax credits for vehicles containing critical minerals processed or recycled by Chinese-controlled entities starting in 2025. This forces U.S. automakers like Ford to re-evaluate their supply chains and reduce dependence on China, which dominates midstream processing of these critical materials. Ford's licensing models with Chinese battery giants like CATL will require strict legal and operational separation to comply.

Middle East Conflict: An escalating conflict involving Iran, Israel, and the United States as of June 2025 has led to significant disruptions in global energy markets. Oil prices have surged, raising concerns about increased gasoline costs and higher raw material prices for vehicle manufacturing, which could lead to higher production costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks for Ford.

Shift to Regional Manufacturing Hubs:

Mexico: Mexico presents a significant opportunity as a growing hub for automotive production, particularly for electric and hybrid models. Companies like Ford are increasing production in Mexican plants, leveraging a skilled labor force, competitive logistics, and a developing supplier ecosystem. This helps embed Mexico into global electrification efforts and can serve as a strategy to navigate tariffs.

Southeast Asia: Countries like Thailand and Malaysia are emerging as anchors for EV supply chains, attracting investment in battery and EV manufacturing, which could provide alternative sourcing for non-Chinese components.

UK Regulatory Impact on Exports: A specific policy change in the UK in April 2025, reclassifying double-cab pickups (like Ford's Ranger) from commercial vans to passenger cars, has sharply increased ownership costs. This led to a significant drop in demand for the South African-assembled Ranger exports to Europe, resulting in Ford cutting nearly 500 jobs in South Africa. This highlights how localized policy changes can have global reverberations for Ford's export markets.

Ford's Strategic Response: Ford is making strategic adjustments to adapt to these geopolitical challenges. This includes investments in next-generation EV platforms to achieve cost parity with Chinese rivals by 2027 and expanding its manufacturing footprint in China to compete in that market, which is projected to account for 80% of global EV sales by 2030. Simultaneously, Ford announced a $2 billion shift from planned all-electric SUVs to hybrid models in August 2024, reflecting a pragmatic approach to balancing consumer preferences with the economic realities of intense global EV competition. The company is also focused on boosting domestic sourcing for EVs, including battery manufacturing, to mitigate tariff impacts and build more resilient supply chains. The overall unpredictability driven by geopolitical tensions and fluctuating consumer incentives is pushing the industry, including Ford, towards more flexible production systems that can adapt rapidly to market shifts and policy changes.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

Ford Motor Company is navigating a transformative period, balancing its legacy internal combustion engine (ICE) business with a significant pivot towards electrification and software-driven services. As of October 4, 2025, the company's outlook presents a mix of strategic opportunities and persistent challenges, reflected in both optimistic (bull) and pessimistic (bear) scenarios for its future.

Short-Term Outlook (2025-2026)

Financial Projections:

For the full year 2025, Ford expects an adjusted EBIT between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, with adjusted free cash flow projected between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $9 billion. This guidance was updated during the Q2 2025 earnings call, reflecting underlying strong first-half performance and continued cost improvement.

In Q2 2025, Ford reported a record revenue of $50 billion and an adjusted EBIT of $2.1 billion. Q3 2025 U.S. sales surged by 8.2% year-over-year, reaching 545,522 vehicles, marking seven consecutive months of sales growth. The company also reported Q3 2025 record electrified vehicle sales (hybrids, plug-ins, and all-electrics) of 85,789 units, a 19.8% increase year-over-year, accounting for 15.7% of total sales.

Market Share:

Ford maintained strong market positions in key segments. The F-Series remains a primary profit engine, contributing 58% of earnings from 43% of revenue. Expedition sales saw a significant boost of 47.4% in Q3 2025, raising its segment share to 23% between April and August. Ford Pro Intelligence software subscriptions grew approximately 30% year-over-year, reaching 815,000 active subscribers, demonstrating strength in its commercial vehicle segment. Ford holds nearly 13% market share in the U.S., about 10% in the UK, and under 2% in China.

EV Profitability:

Ford's Model e (EV) division continues to face profitability challenges. The segment reported an EBIT loss of $1.2 billion in Q3 2025, narrowing slightly from a $1.3 billion loss in Q2 2025. For the full year 2025, Ford expects Model e to incur losses between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, consistent with previous guidance. The company projects achieving EV profitability by 2026, targeting an 8% profit margin on EVs, driven by increasing sales, reduced battery costs, and improved research and design. However, some analysts view this timeline as increasingly optimistic given current market conditions. EV products currently yield 17% lower margins than traditional vehicles.

Long-Term Projections (2027-2030 and beyond)

Financial Projections:

Ford aims for a revenue mix by 2026-2030 of 40% full EV, 30% hybrid, and 30% efficient ICE vehicles, all built on a unified digital backbone. Subscription-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), fleet analytics, and energy management services are projected to generate over $20 billion in annual high-margin revenue by this period. Some analysts forecast a 56% upside potential for Ford's stock by 2030. Annual revenue could reach between $180 billion and $220 billion by 2030, representing 3-5% annual growth.

Market Share:

Ford is targeting 12-15% of the global EV market by 2030. Its dominant 43% commercial vehicle market share in North America is expected to be maintained.

EV Profitability:

The long-term profitability of the Model e division hinges on scaling production, reducing battery costs, and leveraging new platforms. Ford expects its next-generation EVs to be profitable, affordable, and high-volume. The company is prioritizing small and medium-sized trucks and utility vehicles in its EV strategy, which require ""much lower-cost batteries."" However, larger retail electric utility vehicles are seen as having ""unresolvable economics"" due to high battery costs and customer resistance to paying a premium.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for Ford is predicated on several key factors:

Strong Performance in Legacy and Hybrid Segments: Robust demand for profitable ICE vehicles, especially trucks (F-Series) and SUVs (Expedition, Bronco), provides a crucial cash flow buffer to fund EV transition. Ford's hybrid vehicle sales are growing rapidly (record 55,177 units in Q3 2025), offering a profitable hedge against volatile battery electric vehicle (BEV) demand and outperforming EVs in profitability.

Successful EV Re-platforming and Affordability: The new Universal EV Platform, a $5 billion investment, aims to significantly reduce parts by 20% and assembly time by 15%, leading to more cost-competitive EVs. The planned launch of a $30,000 midsize electric pickup in 2027 is a critical step towards high-volume, affordable EVs, potentially expanding market reach.

Ford Pro Growth and Software Services: The Ford Pro commercial division continues to show strong earnings and growth in high-margin software subscriptions, transforming commercial vehicles into a platform for predictable service revenue. This segment provides a consistent revenue stream and strengthens the overall financial health of the company.

Narrowing EV Losses and Path to Profitability: Despite current losses, the Model e segment has shown some signs of narrowing losses (Q1 2025). Achieving the targeted EV profitability by 2026 would significantly de-risk the transition and boost investor confidence.

Strategic Partnerships and Supply Chain: Partnerships for LFP batteries with SK On and CATL aim to secure domestic supply chains and reduce costs, positioning Ford to compete in the affordable EV market.

Bear Case Scenarios

Conversely, the bear case highlights significant risks and challenges:

Persistent EV Losses and Delayed Profitability: The Model e division is still incurring substantial losses (projected $5-5.5 billion for 2025), and the timeline for EV profitability by 2026 is increasingly viewed as optimistic by some analysts. Continued heavy investment in EVs without commensurate returns could strain overall finances.

Volatile EV Demand and Policy Shifts: CEO Jim Farley has indicated that U.S. EV demand could decline sharply, potentially halving from 10% to 5% of the domestic market, due to the expiration of federal EV tax credits and other policy changes. This could lead to inventory issues and further pricing pressure.

Cost Pressures and Tariffs: Ford faces persistent cost pressures from tariffs, with an $800 million impact in Q2 2025 and an expected $3 billion hit by year-end. Global supply chain shifts and regulatory risks further exacerbate these cost headwinds.

Declining Profitability in Conventional Segment: While Ford Blue has been a cash cow, the conventional car segment experienced a significant decline in profitability in the first half of 2025, attributed to inventory stocking. This could reduce the financial buffer available for EV investments.

Financial Health Indicators: A high debt-to-equity ratio (3.56) and an Altman Z-Score of 1.01 (indicating a ""distress zone"") signal potential financial instability, raising concerns about leverage. Some analysts also project very low revenue growth (0.25% CAGR between 2024-2027) and consistently low operating margins (1.9% average over five years).

Quality and Recall Issues: Recent recalls affecting over 115,000 trucks (steering column defect) and 2020-2021 Expedition/Navigator SUVs (electrical short) could impact brand reputation and incur significant warranty costs.

Strategic Pivots as of 10/4/2025

Ford is actively implementing several strategic pivots to navigate the evolving automotive landscape:

Rebalancing Electrification Strategy: Ford is broadening its electrification strategy to include a wider range of hybrid options, acknowledging cooling demand for pure EVs in some segments. CEO Jim Farley stated that ""partial electrification, such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept."" This includes a substantial investment in hybrid advancements and new assembly techniques, targeting cost reductions of 20%.

Affordable EV Focus: The company is aggressively pursuing an affordable, high-volume EV strategy. A $2 billion investment in Kentucky's Louisville Assembly Plant is dedicated to producing a 2027 midsize electric pickup truck with a targeted MSRP of around $30,000, built on a new ""Universal EV Platform"" designed for efficiency and scalability. This platform aims to reduce parts by 20% and assembly time by 15%.

Commercial Vehicle Dominance (Ford Pro): Ford is strengthening its Ford Pro commercial segment, focusing on recurring revenue streams through software and services. Subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew by 30% year-over-year. The company will prioritize the introduction of a new digitally advanced commercial van in 2026.

Cost Reduction and Manufacturing Efficiency: Ford is committed to closing competitive cost gaps through operational efficiencies and inventory management, targeting $1 billion in annual cost savings. This includes streamlining product offerings and optimizing production processes. The company is also realigning battery sourcing to be more efficient and contribute to lower overall costs in its EV portfolio.

Global Market Expansion and Local Adaptation: Ford is establishing a new subsidiary in China to manage marketing, sales, and service, aiming to strengthen its presence in this critical market. In Europe, while facing challenges with EV uptake, Ford is also developing ""multi-energy"" models, including new ICE-powered SUVs and hybrid options, to cater to diverse customer preferences.

Software and Services Integration: The ""Ford+"" plan emphasizes an interconnected hardware, software, and services ecosystem. This includes continued development of features like BlueCruise hands-free driving, which has surpassed 7 million hours of use, and expanding mobile service capabilities. The goal is to generate high-margin recurring revenue from these digital offerings.

These strategic pivots collectively aim to balance current profitability from traditional and hybrid vehicles with future growth in cost-effective, high-volume EVs and value-added software services.

15. Conclusion

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) presents a complex but evolving picture for investors as of October 4, 2025. While the company demonstrates resilience in its traditional and electrified vehicle sales, significant challenges remain, particularly in achieving profitability within its electric vehicle (EV) segment. Investors are advised to balance the company's established strengths with ongoing risks and monitor key developments in the near and long term.

Summary of Key Findings (as of 10/4/2025):

Ford reported strong U.S. vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2025, with an overall increase of 8.2% year-over-year. Electrified vehicle sales, encompassing hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), saw a significant rise of 19.8%, accounting for 15.7% of total sales and outpacing some competitors. Truck and SUV sales also grew, with the popular F-Series up 7% and Mustang Mach-E sales increasing by over 50%.

Financially, the first half of 2025 reportedly saw a significant decline in net income, dropping to $435 million from $3.16 billion in 2024. The company's Q3 2025 financial results are scheduled to be released on October 23, 2025.

Ford's Model e (EV) division continues to incur substantial losses, losing over $5 billion in 2024 and on track for slightly less, but still significant, losses in 2025. While these losses are narrowing, profitability is still considered years away. The company is strategically shifting towards a new, lower-cost universal EV platform to enhance affordability and improve future profitability. Conventional vehicle profitability has also declined, largely attributed to inventory builds, which Ford views as transitory.

Debt levels remain manageable, with interest costs under 1% of revenue, although the debt-to-equity ratio of 3.56 indicates a high level of leverage. Ford offers an attractive dividend yield, with current earnings covering the payout, but future investment needs for the EV segment could pressure its sustainability.

Analyst sentiment is mixed, with a consensus ""Reduce"" rating from seventeen research firms (3 sell, 12 hold, 2 buy) and an average twelve-month price target below the current stock price. Some analysts suggest the stock might be overvalued given its P/E ratio, while others see it as attractively valued. Recent recalls of over 115,000 trucks due to steering column defects and an expansion of a recall for certain Expedition and Navigator SUVs due to fire risks highlight ongoing quality control challenges.

Balanced Perspective for Investors:

Strengths:

Strong Core Business: Ford maintains a dominant position in the profitable truck and SUV segments in the U.S., with robust sales of models like the F-Series, Expedition, Bronco, and Explorer.

Growing Electrified Sales: The company is successfully growing its electrified vehicle sales, outperforming some rivals and demonstrating increasing consumer demand for its hybrid and BEV offerings.

Ford Pro Momentum: The commercial vehicle division, Ford Pro, is performing strongly, with increasing software subscriptions, offering a source of recurring revenue and a comprehensive ecosystem for commercial customers.

Strategic Adaptability: Ford is demonstrating a proactive approach to the EV transition by developing a new, lower-cost universal EV platform and expanding digital services.

Resilient Capital Structure: Debt, excluding Ford Credit, is manageable, and the company has a track record of strong cash flow from its core operations.

Challenges:

EV Segment Losses: The most significant challenge is the substantial and ongoing losses in the Model e division, which continue to drag down overall profitability, with a clear path to profitability still uncertain and potentially years away.

Profitability Pressure: Ford's operating and net margins are relatively low, indicating difficulties in consistently converting revenue into profit.

High Leverage: The company's high debt-to-equity ratio signals a reliance on debt financing, which could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment or economic downturn.

Tariff Headwinds: Tariffs, including a projected $2 billion hit in 2025, create cost pressures and market uncertainty.

Market Slowdown Concerns: Forecasts for a slowing U.S. auto market from Q4 2025 into 2026 could impact sales volumes and pricing power.

Product Recalls: Persistent vehicle recalls impact brand reputation, incur costs, and reflect potential quality control issues.

Global Market Struggles: Ford faces declining sales in key international markets such as China and ongoing difficulties in the European market.

Opportunities:

EV Market Penetration: The shift to a lower-cost EV platform could unlock greater market share and accelerate the path to profitability for the Model e division, especially as EV demand grows.

Ford Pro Growth: Further expansion of Ford Pro's integrated solutions and software services offers a significant avenue for high-margin, recurring revenue growth.

New Product Launches: Upcoming vehicle launches, such as the Explorer Tremor and F-150 Lobo street truck, have the potential to boost sales and market excitement.

Hybrid Vehicle Demand: Continued strong performance and growth in hybrid sales can act as a bridge to full EV adoption and diversify powertrain offerings.

International Market Revitalization: Strategic moves like establishing a new subsidiary in China could help re-establish and grow Ford's presence in crucial global markets.

Risks:

Uncertain EV Profitability: The primary risk remains the long and uncertain road to profitability for the EV segment, which could continue to drain resources and depress overall financial performance.

Economic Downturn: As a cyclical industry, a significant economic downturn or prolonged high interest rates could severely impact vehicle sales and profitability.

Intense Competition: Ford faces fierce competition from both established automakers and new entrants in both the traditional and EV markets, which could pressure pricing and market share.

Regulatory & Policy Shifts: Changes in government incentives for EVs, emissions standards, or tariff policies can significantly impact manufacturing costs and consumer demand.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Ongoing vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly for semiconductors and battery materials, could disrupt production and increase costs.

Brand and Reputation Damage: Ongoing recalls or quality issues could erode consumer trust and harm brand perception.

What Investors Should Watch For:

Near Term (next 6-12 months):

Q3 2025 Earnings Release (October 23, 2025): The upcoming earnings report will provide crucial insights into Ford's latest financial health, the performance of its Model e division, and the profitability of its conventional business.

EV Segment Progress: Monitor the extent to which Model e losses continue to narrow and for any updates on the development and deployment of the new lower-cost EV platform.

Sales Momentum and Market Outlook: Observe if the positive Q3 sales growth, especially in electrified and truck/SUV segments, can be sustained into Q4 and early 2026, particularly given forecasts for a potentially slowing U.S. auto market.

Tariff Developments: Any clarity or changes in tariff policies, especially regarding U.S. auto production or imports from Mexico/Canada, will be critical.

Dividend Outlook: While the dividend yield is attractive, investors should watch for any signals regarding its sustainability as Ford continues to invest heavily in its future.

Long Term (1-5+ years):

EV Profitability and Scale: Ford's ultimate success hinges on its ability to transition its EV division from a significant loss-maker to a profitable and scalable business, driven by its new platform strategy and battery technology advancements.

Ford+ Plan Execution: Assess the long-term impact of the Ford+ plan, particularly the sustained growth and profitability of Ford Pro, and the overall efficiency improvements across the company.

Competitive Landscape: Ford's ability to maintain its competitive edge in key segments while effectively challenging rivals in the rapidly evolving EV market will be vital.

Financial Health Metrics: Look for improvements in profitability margins, a reduction in the debt-to-equity ratio, and stronger financial health indicators.

Global Market Performance: Evidence of a successful turnaround and sustained growth in challenging international markets like China and Europe will indicate broader global competitiveness.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

""This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,"" Symons said. ""Whittling away at EPA's ability to do its job.""

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

governor Will the US mint a $1 coin with Trump’s face for the nation’s 250th birthday?","A group of Massachusetts lawmakers are demanding that the U.S. Energy Department explain why it killed around $466 million in grants bound for the Bay State.

In a Friday letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright shared exclusively with MassLive, the lawmakers, led by Democratic U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, argued that canceling the grants will “hamstring American competitiveness, drive up energy costs, and hurt domestic manufacturing.”

The Trump administration announced Thursday that it had pulled the plug on nearly $7.6 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, according to the Energy Department’s website.

All of the affected states were won by Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

Markey, joined by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and all nine Democratic members of the state’s U.S. House delegation, argued that the White House’s action will “undermine investments in American innovation for years to come— ceding ground to China and other nations that understand the merit of technological development and investment.""

In a statement, the Energy Department said many of the 223 projects affected by the decision were “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” Wright said in the agency’s statement, adding that the “cancellations deliver on that commitment.”

“Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” Wright said.

In a post to X on Wednesday, Office of Management Budget Director Russell Vought telegraphed the administration’s decision, saying it would claw back “nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda ... The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA.”

An analysis by Politico, however, determined that states that congressional districts that voted for Trump also would be impacted by the White House’s decision.

A list of the projects showed that the decision would ripple across the Bay State, with such universities as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Massachusetts Amherst being affected, as well as regional energy titan National Grid.

The nonprofit Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod also made the White House’s cancellation list.

“President Trump is further weaponizing his government shutdown to cost people jobs and hurt our economy,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.

“ ... He’s cutting nearly half a billion dollars for our businesses, universities and non-profits that are working on cutting-edge technologies to lower energy costs, create good jobs and build a more reliable grid,” Healey continued. “All of our residents will be harmed by this vindictive action. We need the Trump administration to restore this funding and reopen our government.”

Markey and his colleagues gave Wright until Oct. 10 to respond to a battery of questions that included details on the appeals process for the clawed-back federal cash and whether the agency had considered the impact on energy prices.

“The impact of any attempt to cancel these grants will not be restricted to the Commonwealth—it will affect subgrantees and company partners in North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, and Texas, among other states,"" the lawmakers wrote.

“It also will sabotage the United States’ ability to compete on next-generation hydrogen and conductive material technologies, which China and other nations continue to lead on,” they continued.

North America: In the U.S. market, Stellantis competes intensely with General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota, and Hyundai/Kia.","Stellantis (NYSE: STLA, Euronext Paris: STLAP, Euronext Milan: STLAM) is a global automotive manufacturing corporation formed in 2021 from the merger of the French PSA Group and the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Headquartered in the Netherlands, this powerful alliance created the world's fourth-largest automaker by volume, boasting a vast portfolio of 14 iconic automotive brands, including Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall. The name ""Stellantis,"" derived from the Latin ""stello"" meaning ""to brighten with stars,"" symbolizes a new beginning and a unified vision for sustainable mobility.

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis remains a significant focal point in the automotive industry due to its pragmatic and evolving electrification strategy, recent financial performance, and a renewed leadership focus on key markets. The company initially launched its ""Dare Forward 2030"" strategic plan with ambitious targets for battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales. However, it has since adjusted this aggressive roadmap, shifting to a ""multi-energy"" strategy that incorporates plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and mild hybrids (MHVs) alongside BEVs, and even reintroducing popular gas-powered models to meet diverse market demands and optimize capital efficiency.

This strategic pivot comes after a challenging 2024 and early 2025, which saw a significant decline in net revenues and profits, attributed to reduced shipment volumes, inventory reduction initiatives, and product transition gaps. However, a recent and robust 6% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales during the third quarter of 2025 has injected much-needed optimism. This turnaround ended a challenging two-year period of eight consecutive quarters of declining sales for its American subsidiary, with Jeep sales climbing by 11% and Ram retail sales by 26%, leading to an 8% surge in Stellantis's stock price on October 2, 2025.

Under the new leadership of CEO Antonio Filosa, who assumed the role in June 2025, Stellantis is prioritizing strengthening its position in the U.S. retail market, fostering collaboration with dealers, increasing advertising, and introducing competitive, affordable products. With a plan to launch 10 new models in 2025, including more affordable trims for the Ram 1500, the range-extended Ram 1500 Ramcharger, and gas-powered Dodge Charger models, Stellantis is aggressively refreshing its product pipeline. The company is also integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance products and services, expanding battery manufacturing, and exploring hydrogen fuel-cell technology.

Stellantis is at a critical juncture, actively recalibrating its strategy to navigate a dynamic automotive landscape marked by evolving consumer preferences, intense competition, and regulatory pressures. Its relevance stems from its massive brand portfolio, its strategic shift towards a multi-energy approach in vehicle development, and its ongoing efforts to innovate while navigating a complex and competitive global market.

2. Historical Background

Stellantis N.V. officially commenced operations on January 16, 2021, born from the 50:50 merger of two automotive titans: the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group. This union created the world's fourth-largest automaker by volume, a testament to the rich and often tumultuous histories of its constituent parts. The name ""Stellantis,"" derived from the Latin ""stello"" (to brighten with stars), was chosen to symbolize a new, ambitious future for the combined entity.

Predecessor Histories and Key Transformations

The journey to Stellantis is a narrative woven from over a century of automotive innovation, strategic acquisitions, and periods of significant challenge and transformation.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA):

FCA itself was a relatively recent creation, established on October 12, 2014, through the merger of Italy's Fiat S.p.A. and the U.S.-based Chrysler Group LLC.

Fiat S.p.A. Origins: Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (FIAT) was founded in Turin, Italy, in 1899 by a group of investors, including Giovanni Agnelli. Fiat quickly grew to become Italy's largest car manufacturer, known for its reliable and affordable models such as the Fiat 501. Post-World War II, Fiat's iconic 500 Topolino (1936) and the later Fiat 500 (1950s) revolutionized urban mobility. Over decades, Fiat expanded its empire by acquiring prestigious brands like Lancia and Alfa Romeo. A significant strategic move in 2016 saw Ferrari spun off from FCA, allowing both entities to focus on their distinct market segments.

Chrysler Group LLC Origins: Chrysler was founded on June 6, 1925, by Walter P. Chrysler, following the reorganization of the Maxwell Motor Company. It rapidly ascended to become one of the ""Big Three"" American automakers. Chrysler's history is marked by various partnerships and ownership changes, notably its nine-year alliance with German-based Daimler-Benz AG (DaimlerChrysler) from 1998 to 2007. The 2008 financial crisis pushed Chrysler into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. This period proved pivotal, as Fiat began acquiring a stake in the struggling American automaker, eventually gaining full ownership in January 2014, which directly led to the formation of FCA.

PSA Group (Peugeot S.A.):

The PSA Group, headquartered in France, boasts an even longer lineage, tracing its industrial roots back to the early 19th century.

Peugeot Origins: The Peugeot family's industrial ventures began in 1810 with steel production. The company ventured into the nascent automotive industry in 1889, and Armand Peugeot formally established Société Anonyme des Automobiles Peugeot in 1896, initiating mass production of cars by 1929.

Citroën Origins: André Citroën founded his eponymous company in Paris in 1919, quickly earning a reputation for innovative and distinctive mass-produced vehicles.

Formation of PSA Group: The PSA Group was officially formed in 1976 when Peugeot S.A. acquired a majority stake in the financially struggling Citroën S.A.

Key Transformations: PSA expanded its European footprint by acquiring Chrysler Europe in 1978, subsequently rebranding these subsidiaries as Talbot. The company was renamed PSA Peugeot Citroën in 1991, and then rebranded as Groupe PSA in 2016, signaling a broader strategic shift. A major expansion occurred in 2017 with the acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall Motors from General Motors, solidifying PSA's position as Europe's second-largest carmaker at the time. The PSA Group's successful turnaround programs, such as ""Back in the Race"" (2014) and ""Push to Pass"" (2016), which focused on brand differentiation, complexity reduction, efficiency improvements, and strategic investment in growth markets.

The Merger of FCA and PSA Group

The genesis of Stellantis began with FCA's unsuccessful attempt to merge with Renault in early 2019. Following this, FCA turned its attention to the PSA Group.

Announcement and Agreement: On October 31, 2019, FCA publicly announced its intention to merge with the PSA Group. By December 18, 2019, both companies had signed a binding agreement for a 50/50 all-stock merger, valued at approximately $50 billion. The stated goal was to create an industry leader with the necessary scale and resources to capitalize on opportunities in sustainable mobility.

Naming and Approvals: The corporate name ""Stellantis"" was announced on July 15, 2020. The merger received crucial approval from the European Commission on December 21, 2020, and was overwhelmingly endorsed by shareholders of both FCA and PSA on January 4, 2021.

Completion and Leadership: The merger was officially completed on January 16, 2021, dissolving both FCA and Groupe PSA as independent entities. John Elkann, previously Chairman of FCA, became the Chairman of Stellantis, while Carlos Tavares, the former CEO of PSA Group, was appointed CEO. Although structured as a 50/50 merger, PSA was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Stellantis established its headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, with significant operational centers remaining in France, Italy, and the United States.

Post-Merger Vision: Stellantis was formed with a portfolio of 14 iconic brands and immediately outlined ambitious strategic plans, including a commitment to invest over €30 billion in electrification and software development through 2025. The company aimed to become a leader in electric vehicles, with aggressive targets for BEV sales in Europe and the U.S. by 2030. Other priorities included global expansion, technological innovation (autonomous driving, connected cars), and leveraging merger synergies for substantial cost savings. Early post-merger milestones involved expanding software capabilities, forging partnerships with tech companies like Foxconn, and acquiring mobility startups, all while standardizing supplier requirements and IT systems across the newly formed entity.

Notable Stock Moves and Events:

Merger Completion (January 2021): The official formation of Stellantis from FCA and PSA Group created the world's fourth-largest automaker by global vehicle sales, aiming for projected annual cost savings.

Leadership Change (2024-2025): CEO Carlos Tavares resigned in December 2024 after a 70% drop in net profit for the company in 2024, alongside declining global shipments and U.S. market share. Antonio Filosa, a long-time executive, was appointed CEO effective June 23, 2025, with expectations for a renewed emphasis on the North American market. Filosa's actionable plans were well-received, contributing to a stock increase in September 2025.

H1 2025 Financial Challenges: Stellantis reported a net loss of €2.3 billion and significantly reduced adjusted operating income of €0.5 billion for the first half of 2025. Industrial free cash flows were negative at €3.0 billion. These challenges were attributed to €3.3 billion in pre-tax charges (program cancellations, impairments, restructuring), €0.3 billion in U.S. tariff costs, higher industrial costs, geographic mix factors, and product transition difficulties. Global consolidated shipments declined by 6% year-over-year in Q2 2025, with North American shipments falling by 25%.

Q3 2025 U.S. Sales Rebound: In a positive development, Stellantis announced a 6% increase in U.S. sales for Q3 2025, breaking a two-year negative streak. This news caused an 8% jump in the stock price on October 2, 2025.

Strategic Acquisitions and Initiatives: In 2022, Stellantis acquired aiMotive, an artificial intelligence company, to advance its autonomous driving technologies. The company also committed to an electrification strategy, planning to invest €30 billion in electrification and software development through 2025, targeting 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by 2030 as part of its ""Dare Forward 2030"" plan.

Analyst Sentiment: The consensus analyst rating for Stellantis is ""Reduce,"" based on 15 Wall Street analysts, with an average price target of $12.04.

Key Influencing Factors:

Electric Vehicle (EV) Transition: Stellantis's ambitious EV targets are a major growth driver, with significant investments in new electric and hybrid models. However, a slowdown in EV adoption, driven by affordability concerns and charging infrastructure limitations, has impacted market share and created product portfolio gaps, contributing to the company's challenges in early 2025.

Macroeconomic Conditions: The cyclical nature of the automotive industry means sales volumes are sensitive to economic downturns, inflation, and interest rate changes.

Geopolitical Tensions and Supply Chain Disruptions: Global events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and U.S.-China trade tensions, have caused critical component sourcing disruptions and increased costs, particularly for semiconductors. Raw material costs, like steel, also significantly impacted industrial expenses.

Tariffs: U.S. tariffs have directly impacted Stellantis, costing €0.3 billion in H1 2025 and affecting imported vehicle production. Discussions around potential U.S. auto tariff relief can influence stock performance.

Product Portfolio and Market Strategy: The introduction of new models like the full-hybrid Cherokee and the Dodge Daytona BEV, along with a focus on strengthening its North American market presence under the new CEO, are crucial for future performance. Stellantis also faces the challenge of managing diverse brands and market shares across different regions, with strong performance in South America and the Middle East & Africa offsetting declines in North America and Europe in some periods.

Operational Efficiency and Restructuring: The merger aimed for significant cost savings, and the company continues to implement performance improvement actions. However, restructuring costs and program cancellations have weighed on recent financial results.

Competition: Stellantis operates in a highly competitive global automotive market, competing with major players like Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, and Ford, as well as emerging EV manufacturers.

5. Financial Performance

Stellantis (STLA) has faced a challenging financial period in late 2024 and the first half of 2025, reporting significant declines in earnings and revenue, alongside negative free cash flow. However, the company is anticipating a gradual recovery and positive growth in the latter half of 2025, driven by new product launches and strategic adjustments.

Here's a detailed look at Stellantis's financial performance as of October 4, 2025:

Latest Earnings (H1 2025 and Q1 2025)

First Half (H1) 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025):

Stellantis reported a net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025, a significant decline compared to a net profit of €5.6 billion in H1 2024. This loss includes €3.3 billion in net charges, which were excluded from Adjusted Operating Income (AOI).

Net Revenues: €74.3 billion, a 13% decrease compared to H1 2024. This decline was primarily attributed to year-over-year decreases in North America and Enlarged Europe, although partially offset by growth in South America. The results also reflect impacts from foreign exchange headwinds, tariffs, and lower European Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) industry volumes.

Adjusted Operating Income (AOI): €0.5 billion, with an AOI margin of 0.7%, significantly below H1 2024 levels of €8.5 billion and 10.0%, respectively.

Industrial Free Cash Flows: Negative €3.0 billion, as the subdued AOI generation was more than offset by capital expenditures and research and development (R&D) expenses.

Liquidity: Total industrial available liquidity stood at €47.2 billion at June 30, 2025.

Second Quarter (Q2) 2025:

For Q2 2025, Stellantis reported preliminary global consolidated shipments of 1.4 million units, a 6% year-over-year decline. Net revenue for Q2 was €38.4 billion. The company faced a significant miss on EPS expectations, reporting -€0.78 against a forecast of €0.35. Adjusted Operating Income was €540 million with a 0.7% margin, and industrial free cash flow was an outflow of €3 billion.

First Quarter (Q1) 2025 (Ended March 31, 2025):

Stellantis reported net revenues of €35.8 billion, a 14% decrease compared to Q1 2024. Consolidated shipments for the quarter were 1,217 thousand units, down 9% year-over-year. This was mainly due to lower North American production (affected by extended holiday downtime in January), product transitions, and reduced LCV volumes in Enlarged Europe. New retail orders in the U.S. in March 2025 were up 82% over the prior year.

Revenue Growth

2024:

For the full year 2024, Stellantis reported net revenues of €156.9 billion, a 17% decrease compared to 2023. This was attributed to a 12% decrease in consolidated shipment volumes, temporary gaps in product offerings, and inventory reduction initiatives. Organic revenue, excluding unfavorable currency effects, rose 9%, with volume and mix contributing 5% and net pricing contributing 4% growth.

2025:

As noted above, H1 2025 net revenues were down 13% compared to H1 2024. Despite the challenging first half, Stellantis re-established financial guidance and expects continued sequential improvement in H2 2025, with anticipated positive net revenue growth for the full year 2025.

Margins

2024:

The adjusted operating income for the full year 2024 was €8.6 billion, a 64% decline from the previous year, with an AOI margin of 5.5%. The operating margin was -2.69%, and the net margin was -1.64%, reflecting profitability challenges. The gross margin stood at 7.74%.

2025:

In H1 2025, the AOI was €0.5 billion, resulting in a significantly lower AOI margin of 0.7% compared to 10.0% in H1 2024. Stellantis expects low-single-digit AOI profitability for H2 2025 and a mid-single-digit AOI margin for the full year 2025, anticipating sequential improvement.

Debt

As of June 30, 2025, Stellantis's total debt was $47.88 billion (USD), an increase of 38.46% year-over-year. Short-term debt for the quarter ending June 2025 was $14.437 billion. Long-term debt for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, was $19.460 billion, a 116.51% increase year-over-year. For the fiscal semester ending December 2024, the reported debt was €37.23 billion. The debt-to-equity ratio is 0.56, indicating a moderate level of leverage.

Cash Flow

2024:

Industrial free cash flows were negative €6 billion for the full year 2024, reflecting the decline in income and a temporary enlarged working capital impact due to production adjustments. Annual cash flow from operating activities for 2024 was $4.337 billion, an 82.18% decline from 2023. Annual free cash flow for 2024 was -$6.995 billion, a 146.52% decline from 2023.

2025:

Industrial free cash flows for H1 2025 were negative €3.0 billion. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, was $10.490 billion, a 10.48% decline year-over-year. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, it was $4.125 billion, an 82.45% decline year-over-year. Stellantis expects positive industrial free cash flows for H2 2025 and the full year 2025, driven by stabilized working capital and normalized production schedules.

Valuation Metrics

As of October 2025, Stellantis's valuation metrics present a mixed picture:

P/E Ratio: Currently at 0, reflecting the company's negative earnings. The estimated P/E ratio for 2025 is 11.71.

P/S Ratio: 0.16, which is close to its 5-year low, potentially suggesting undervaluation.

P/B Ratio: 0.32, also near historical lows.

Market Capitalization: Approximately $27.59 billion to $48.11 billion (figures vary slightly across sources, with one reporting $26.66 billion as of Q4 2022).

Enterprise Value: One source reported an enterprise value of -$19.28 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Analyst Targets: The target price is $10.77, with a recommendation score of 3.3, indicating a ""hold"" position. Some analyst price targets range from $8.50 to $15.00 per share.

Altman Z-Score: 1.51, placing Stellantis in the distress zone, which implies a potential risk of bankruptcy within two years.

Q3 2025 Sales Update

Stellantis plans to launch 10 new models in 2025, including three STLA Medium products in H2 2025. The company anticipates ""Positive"" net revenue growth and ""Positive"" industrial free cash flows for the full year 2025.

6. Leadership and Management

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis (STLA) has undergone significant leadership changes, recalibrated its strategic direction, and is navigating a shifting corporate governance landscape.

Stellantis CEO and Leadership Team

CEO: The current Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis is Antonio Filosa, whose appointment became effective on June 23, 2025. Filosa succeeded Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December 2024, reportedly due to internal friction with the board and declining financial performance. Prior to becoming CEO, Filosa served as the Chief Operating Officer of Stellantis North America, a role he took on in October 2024.

Key Leadership Changes and Team Members:

Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Joao Laranjo was appointed as the new CFO and a member of the Stellantis Leadership Team, effective September 29, 2025. He replaced Doug Ostermann, who resigned for personal reasons. Laranjo has a long history with the company, having previously served as CFO of Stellantis North America under Filosa's management earlier in 2025, and held various finance roles at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) since 2009.

Brand CEOs (Effective June 1, 2024):

Ram Brand CEO: Christine Feuell was appointed CEO of the Ram brand, in addition to her role as CEO of the Chrysler brand.

Dodge Brand CEO: Matt McAlear was appointed CEO of the Dodge brand and became a member of the Top Executive Team.

European Operations (October 2024): Jean-Philippe Imparato became Chief Operating Officer for Europe, tasked with strengthening the region's commercial performance during the energy transition.

Maserati and Alfa Romeo: Santo Ficili was appointed CEO of Maserati and Alfa Romeo, also joining the top executive team in October 2024.

Board of Directors

As of October 4, 2025, the Stellantis Board of Directors is structured with a mix of executive and non-executive members.

Chairman: John Elkann

Vice Chairman: Robert Peugeot

CEO and Executive Director: Antonio Filosa

Recent Board Changes (April 15, 2025): Alice Schroeder and Daniel Ramot were appointed as non-executive directors. These appointments were significant as they brought American business and tech expertise to a previously more European-centric board, potentially signaling a strategic pivot towards the North American market, where Stellantis aims for a turnaround. They replaced Wan Ling Martello and Jacques Saint-Exupéry.

Strategy

Stellantis's overarching strategic plan remains ""Dare Forward 2030,"" initially unveiled in 2022. However, the company has significantly revised key components of this strategy, particularly concerning electrification targets.

Revised Electrification Goals: Stellantis has ""slammed the brakes"" on its original ambition to sell only battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in Europe by the end of the decade. This shift was confirmed by Stellantis's European chief at the Munich Motor Show, citing challenges such as inadequate charging infrastructure, slower-than-forecasted EV adoption rates, and soaring raw material costs.

Multi-Energy Approach: CEO Antonio Filosa is advocating for regulators to be more flexible and support hybrid technology, viewing the European Union's wider goal of zero-emission new cars by 2035 as ""unrealistic"" under current market conditions. Several Stellantis brands, including Alfa Romeo and Fiat, have already shifted to a ""multi-energy"" approach, and Dodge even pulled an entry-level electric Charger Daytona model due to poor demand.

Focus on Core Markets and Profitability: Under Filosa's leadership, Stellantis is reviewing its portfolio and industrial footprint. This includes considering the sale of its Free2move car-sharing unit to exit unprofitable ventures and concentrate investments on core brands and markets, especially the United States, which has shown recent quarterly sales gains. A new business plan is expected to be presented to investors in the first quarter of 2026.

Technology and Innovation: Stellantis is expanding its collaboration with Mistral AI to embed generative AI across its operations, aiming to enhance customer experience in sales and aftersales and increase efficiency in engineering and other domains.

Sustainability Goal: The company still aims to achieve carbon net-zero status by 2038.

Governance Reputation

Stellantis's governance reputation has seen recent shifts, particularly with the change in CEO.

Carlos Tavares's Departure and Impact: The departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares in December 2024 was reportedly influenced by growing disagreements with the board, declining sales, and public conflict with the Italian government over job cuts. Tavares's management style was perceived by some as detrimental to the Italian automotive industry, with criticisms of factory relocation and production reduction in Italy.

Antonio Filosa's Approach: The new CEO, Antonio Filosa, has demonstrated a different leadership style, particularly in Italy. He has initiated direct, unprecedented discussions with all Italian automotive unions regarding the group's industrial future in the country. This move aims to address long-standing tensions and seeks union input on assigning hybrid models to Italian plants, relaunching engine production, and clarifying the future of brands like Maserati. This initiative is seen as a significant departure from his predecessor's approach and could mark a positive turning point in labor relations.

Board Composition and Market Focus: The addition of American directors to the board, Alice Schroeder and Daniel Ramot, in April 2025, suggests a move to diversify the board's expertise and potentially rebalance its strategic focus towards the North American market, a crucial region for the company's profitability. This change could improve governance by ensuring broader perspectives are considered in strategic decision-making.

7. Products, Services, and Innovations

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a dynamic automotive landscape by recalibrating its product offerings, electrifying its portfolio with a multi-energy strategy, investing heavily in research and development, and leveraging strategic partnerships to maintain a competitive edge. The company is demonstrating a pragmatic pivot in its electrification approach, reintroducing popular internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid models while continuing to advance technological innovations.

Sector-Level Trends

The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by several key trends:

Electrification (EVs, PHEVs, MHEVs): The global push towards electric vehicles (EVs) continues, though the pace of adoption has slowed in some markets, notably Europe and the U.S., compared to earlier forecasts. This slowdown is attributed to factors such as inadequate charging infrastructure, high raw material costs, and consumer affordability concerns. In response, there's a growing emphasis on ""multi-energy"" strategies, integrating plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and mild hybrids (MHEVs) alongside battery electric vehicles (BEVs). China remains a dominant force, driving innovation in vehicle architecture and leading in EV sales, while European and American automakers face increasing competition from cost-competitive Chinese EV brands.

Autonomous Driving and Connected Cars: Level 2 automated driving systems (e.g., lane centering, adaptive cruise control) are becoming mainstream across various price ranges. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into vehicle cockpits for smarter, safer, and more personalized experiences, and also plays a role in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and predictive maintenance. The concept of ""software-defined vehicles"" is reshaping consumer expectations, requiring mastery of digital tools and rapid adaptation from manufacturers.

Sustainable Materials: The quest for sustainability is intensifying, with automakers adopting lightweight, bio-based materials and even vegan alternatives to leather to reduce vehicle weight and carbon footprints. By 2025, there's an expectation that every vehicle component will need to justify its sustainability credentials.

Price Wars: A fierce price war is ongoing in the electric vehicle sector, particularly in Europe, as Western automakers contend with low-cost Chinese competitors. This pressure forces manufacturers to significantly reduce production costs without compromising quality.

Macro Drivers

Several macroeconomic factors are shaping the automotive industry's performance:

Interest Rates and Inflation: Elevated interest rates for car financing have persisted for almost three years, impacting consumer affordability. While inflation has receded globally, rising material costs continue to exert upward pressure on vehicle prices.

Tariffs and Trade Policies: Newly imposed and upcoming tariffs, particularly a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts in the U.S., are creating significant ripples. These tariffs are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices, potentially leading to a long-term decline in sales despite a short-term rush to buy before prices surge. Geopolitical tensions and protectionist measures are forcing automakers to re-evaluate and reorganize supply chains.

Economic Growth and Consumer Demand: Global vehicle sales growth is slow for 2024 and 2025, with forecasts of modest increases (around 1.6-2.7%). Weakened consumer demand, coupled with high vehicle prices and consumer debt, is expected to constrain sales.

Government Regulations and Incentives: Stricter emissions regulations, particularly the EU's 2025 CO2 reduction targets, are pushing OEMs to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission technologies. However, the effectiveness and duration of EV subsidies in various markets, coupled with uncertain policy shifts, are influencing consumer behavior and market growth. Some politicians are seen to be pushing EV mandates that may not align with current consumer demand.

Supply Chains

Automotive supply chains continue to face significant challenges:

Component Shortages: Ongoing shortages of critical components, especially semiconductor chips and specialized metals, are still impacting vehicle production and repairs. These shortages have led to production delays and increased prices for parts.

Rising Raw Material Costs: The cost of raw materials, particularly for EV batteries (lithium, nickel, cobalt), has risen significantly since the pandemic, making EVs more expensive to produce. This is forcing automakers to raise prices, affecting affordability.

Logistics Challenges: Freight delays, a global shortage of shipping containers, and rising fuel costs have driven up transportation expenses, further increasing the cost of parts.

Diversification and Regionalization: Manufacturers are diversifying suppliers, investing in domestic production, and building more resilient supply chains to mitigate future disruptions and respond to geopolitical tensions and tariffs.

Cyclical Effects

The automotive industry is inherently cyclical, and as of late 2025, it is experiencing:

Slow Growth but Stabilizing Inventory: After a turbulent period, new vehicle production and inventories have improved substantially, helping to stabilize the market and ease some price pressures. However, overall global sales growth remains sluggish, with projections for 2025 indicating only modest increases.

Consumer Behavior: With expected higher costs for new vehicles due to tariffs and inflation, consumers are likely to hold onto their existing vehicles longer, keeping the inventory of used cars low and potentially driving up used car prices. Increased incentives from sellers are expected as inventories swell and supply chains stabilize.

Regional Disparities: Global car markets show mixed trends; for example, North America has seen modest growth, while Europe experienced a decline in registrations in the first half of 2025. China, however, continues to show strong growth in sales and production.

Impact on Stellantis (STLA)

These industry and market trends have a direct and significant impact on Stellantis:

Financial Performance and Leadership Transition: Stellantis reported a substantial 70% drop in net profit in 2024, accompanied by a 17% decrease in net revenues and a 12% decline in consolidated shipment volumes. These results were attributed to temporary product offering gaps and inventory reduction efforts. The company announced a preliminary net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025, impacted by higher industrial costs, adverse geographic and product mix, foreign exchange rates, and approximately €330 million in tariffs. Carlos Tavares, the previous CEO, resigned in December 2024, and Antonio Filosa was unanimously appointed CEO effective June 23, 2025, with an expected focus on the North American market. There have also been other leadership changes, including a new CFO.

Recent U.S. Sales Rebound: A significant positive development for Stellantis is the robust 6% increase in its U.S. sales for the third quarter of 2025, breaking an eight-quarter streak of declining sales. This surge, driven by strong demand for Jeep (+11%), Ram (+26%), and Chrysler (+45%) brands, particularly models like the Jeep Wrangler, Gladiator, Wagoneer, and Ram 1500 with the HEMI V-8 engine, led to an 8% increase in Stellantis' stock price. This performance is seen as a potential turnaround and a positive indicator of the new CEO's product strategy.

Evolving Electrification Strategy: Stellantis is explicitly shifting from an ""all-electric"" strategy to a ""multi-energy"" (xEV) approach, acknowledging reduced BEV demand in certain markets and challenges like inadequate charging infrastructure and high raw material costs. The company had originally aimed for 100% BEV sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by 2030 but is now prioritizing flexible platforms that can support gasoline, hybrid, electric, or even hydrogen powertrains. This pragmatic approach is reflected in plans for models like the 2027 crossover (STLA Large platform) offering hybrid options, the return of the Jeep Cherokee as a hybrid, and range-extended versions of Ram trucks. Stellantis has committed over €30 billion to electrification by the end of the decade and has invested in battery technology through joint ventures like Automotive Cells Company (ACC) and a stake in Chinese EV manufacturer Leapmotor to access affordable EV production.

Supply Chain and Cost Pressures: Stellantis, like other automakers, is grappling with semiconductor shortages, rising raw material costs for EV batteries, and increased industrial and warranty costs. The company is consolidating its 20+ platforms into five STLA platforms, designed to be multi-energy capable, to reduce costs and enhance production flexibility.

Tariff Impact: Tariffs have been a significant headwind, contributing to Stellantis's H1 2025 net loss of approximately €330 million, with further impact expected in the second half of the year. These trade policies compel the company to re-evaluate its global supply chains and potentially increase domestic or regional production to mitigate costs.

In summary, Stellantis is in a critical phase, adjusting its long-term electrification goals to a more flexible, multi-energy approach while facing persistent macroeconomic headwinds like high interest rates, inflation, and significant tariff impacts. The recent positive U.S. sales, particularly in its key brands, signal a potential turning point under its new leadership, but the company must continue to navigate complex supply chain issues and intense competition, especially from Chinese manufacturers.

10. Risks and Challenges

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex landscape filled with significant operational, regulatory, and market risks, alongside several notable controversies and specific challenges as of October 4, 2025. The company has faced a challenging period marked by declining sales, profitability pressures, and strategic adjustments, particularly concerning its electric vehicle (EV) transition.

Operational Risks

Stellantis is grappling with a range of operational hurdles:

Production Declines and Pauses: The company experienced a 6% decline in vehicle shipments in Q2 2025, reflecting broader industry challenges and production adjustments. North American production, a historical profit center, saw a 25% drop in shipments in the first half of 2025 due to production disruptions, including extended holiday downtime in January and tariff-related pauses. In Europe, production at facilities like Italy's Mirafiori plant fell dramatically, with overall Italian production reaching its lowest level since 1956 in 2024. Stellantis also temporarily halted production at its Mulhouse plant in France in late 2025 to manage inventories amidst a difficult European market.

Such software-related issues are projected to cost the automotive sector billions annually.

Labor Relations and Workforce Adjustments: Stellantis has faced criticism from unions regarding workforce reductions. In early 2025, the company announced temporary layoffs affecting over 900 US hourly employees due to production pauses in Canada and Mexico, prompting concerns from the UAW. The UAW is also prepared to file grievances over Stellantis's failure to uphold investment commitments, potentially leading to strike action. In March 2025, Stellantis offered buyout packages to UAW-represented hourly employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy. The company also announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in Italy over the next four years.

Regulatory Risks

Stellantis faces considerable risks from evolving regulatory environments:

EU CO2 Emissions Targets: The European Union's stringent CO2 emissions targets for 2025, requiring a 15% reduction from current levels, pose a significant challenge. Non-compliance could lead to substantial fines, potentially up to $2.95 billion (2.5 billion euros) between 2025 and 2027. Stellantis's Europe chief, Jean-Philippe Imparato, has called these targets ""unreachable,"" suggesting the company might need to either double EV sales or slash production of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, potentially leading to factory closures. While Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares initially stated the company was prepared for these targets, the reality of market conditions suggests otherwise.

U.S. Tariffs: The implementation of U.S. tariffs, particularly a 25% levy on imports from Mexico and Canada (where a significant portion of Stellantis's U.S. vehicles are manufactured), is expected to heavily impact operating income. Stellantis warned in July 2025 that these tariffs could cost over $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion) in 2025, with €300 million already incurred in H1. This uncertainty led Stellantis to withdraw its 2025 financial guidance earlier in the year. Tariffs also apply to vehicle imports from Europe, affecting premium brands like Alfa Romeo and Maserati.

Safety and Compliance Regulations: Ongoing recalls related to software and component defects highlight continuous regulatory scrutiny regarding vehicle safety standards.

Controversies

Several controversies have clouded Stellantis's operations:

Financial Performance and Shareholder Scrutiny: The company reported a significant net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) in the first half of 2025, a stark reversal from a €5.6 billion profit in H1 2024. This performance was exacerbated by U.S. tariffs, production delays, and recall costs, leading to a 5.31% stock price drop in February 2025 and an accompanying shareholder lawsuit alleging financial misrepresentation.

Data Breach: In September 2025, Stellantis disclosed a data breach affecting millions of North American customer service operations. The breach, originating from a third-party service provider, exposed basic contact information like names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, though no financial data was compromised. This incident compounds reputational vulnerabilities and highlights cybersecurity risks.

Declining Dealer Trust and Sales: Stellantis has faced a challenging relationship with its dealership network, with 72% of dealers expressing little to no trust in the company by early 2025. U.S. sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters, attributed to delayed launches, high prices, and limited incentives.

Management Shake-up: The abrupt resignation of former CEO Carlos Tavares in December 2024, amid concerns about the company's North American strategy and declining profits, introduced uncertainty. New CEO Antonio Filosa took over in June 2025 and is tasked with a turnaround plan, which includes tackling profitability challenges and repairing dealer relationships.

Profit-Sharing Reduction: UAW workers in the U.S. received a significantly reduced profit-sharing check for 2024, down 73% from the previous year, despite the company reporting $5.8 billion in net profits, leading to anger among employees.

Market Risks

Stellantis is exposed to substantial market-driven risks:

Intense Competition and Market Share Decline: Stellantis's market share declined in key regions in 2024, falling to 8% in North America (from 9.6% in 2023) and 17% in Europe (from 18.3% in 2023). The company faces fierce competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, which dominate affordable EV segments and have gained significant market share in Europe.

Slow EV Adoption and Demand Shifts: Stellantis has acknowledged performing ""well below potential"" in managing the EV transition in 2024. Slow EV adoption rates, high costs of EVs compared to ICE vehicles, and reductions in EV subsidies in Europe have weighed on sales and profitability. The company noted an overall decline in demand in Europe.

Economic Downturns and Cyclicality: As a cyclical company, Stellantis is highly susceptible to economic downturns that can impact vehicle sales. Profitability has been under pressure due to reduced production volumes, increased warranty and quality-related expenses, and strategic investments in EV technology.

Geopolitical Instability and Trade Policies: Beyond direct tariffs, broader trade policies between major economies can increase production costs, raise consumer prices, reduce demand, and impact profitability.

Currency Swings: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates pose a risk to Stellantis's financial performance.

Specific Challenges Faced by the Company

EV Transition Strategy: Stellantis recently abandoned its goal of achieving 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030, recognizing the transition is more complex and uncertain than initially envisioned. The company is now emphasizing a ""flexible approach"" that prioritizes hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies alongside Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), particularly in Europe where it still aims for 100% BEV sales by 2030. Challenges include infrastructure gaps, high battery costs, and consumer hesitancy. The CEO, Carlos Tavares, had previously called the 100% EV target ""unachievable.""

Financial Health: The company's financial performance has been mixed, with a €2.3 billion net loss in H1 2025, negative operating margins, and high debt levels. Its Altman Z-Score of 1.51 places it in the ""distress zone,"" indicating a potential risk of bankruptcy within two years, despite moderate debt levels.

Product Performance and Launches: Dodge sales were down 50% in the first half of 2025, largely due to a poor reception of the Charger Daytona EV. Overall, Stellantis sales were down 11% compared to H1 2024. While the return of the Hemi V8 in Ram trucks and the introduction of gas engines for the electric Charger Daytona aim to boost sales, the company has faced delays in launching new models, such as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which was pushed to 2026.

North American Profitability: Historically a profit engine, North America swung to an operating loss in H1 2025 due to reduced imported vehicle production and weaker fleet sales.

11. Opportunities and Catalysts

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a dynamic automotive landscape, demonstrating a recent turnaround in key markets while strategically adapting its long-term vision. As of October 4, 2025, the company is focused on a multi-pronged approach to growth, including a revitalized product offensive, advanced technology integration, and a re-evaluation of its market presence and electrification strategy.

Growth Levers and Strategic Initiatives

Stellantis has shown promising signs of a rebound, particularly in its crucial North American market. The company reported a robust 6% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales during the third quarter of 2025, marking its first positive sales quarter in two years after a period of decline. This surge was primarily driven by significant growth in key brands: Jeep sales climbed by 11% and Ram retail sales saw a 26% increase. Chrysler also contributed with a substantial 45% rise in sales. This sales momentum is a critical near-term catalyst.

A core strategic initiative is the aggressive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across its operations. Stellantis has expanded its partnership with French startup Mistral AI, moving from pilot programs to enterprise-wide AI deployment. This collaboration aims to embed generative AI into sales, engineering workflows, and customer service. Key to this expansion are the newly launched ""Innovation Lab"" for co-developing customized AI solutions and a ""Transformation Academy"" focused on scaling AI adoption to achieve measurable business impact.

Stellantis is also overhauling its product strategy to meet evolving customer demands. This includes a notable decision to bring back the Hemi V-8 engine to certain Ram trucks and the Dodge Charger, alongside the introduction of new electrified models. The company has expressed a renewed focus on strengthening partnerships with its dealers through consistent incentive programs, increased advertising efforts, and a pipeline of exciting new products designed to support sales.

Furthermore, Stellantis is adjusting its electrification strategy. While its original ""Dare Forward 2030"" plan aimed for 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by the end of the decade, the company has officially signaled a shift away from this rigid target. The updated approach emphasizes offering ""customer choice,"" including hybrids and traditional internal combustion engines (ICE), in recognition of market realities and consumer preferences. Despite this adjustment, the broader ""Dare Forward 2030"" strategy still targets becoming carbon net-zero by 2038, with a 50% reduction by 2030, and a goal of 75+ BEVs globally and 5 million BEV sales by 2030. The company is also expanding its ""SUSTAINera"" aftersales range, including used parts offerings through its partner B-Parts, focusing on the UK market as a strategic opportunity for sustainable and cost-effective solutions.

New Markets

Stellantis is actively pursuing expansion in emerging markets. In South Africa, the company plans to broaden the product lineup at its greenfield manufacturing plant in Gqeberha, moving beyond the initial intention of producing only the Peugeot Landtrek pickup truck. This facility, set to begin production in the second half of 2027, is part of a larger strategy to grow its footprint and industrialize in the African market, targeting both local and wider African sales.

Additionally, Stellantis is leveraging partnerships for market entry. It plans to launch the Leapmotor C10 range-extended electric SUV from its joint venture with Chinese automaker Leapmotor in South Africa this year, with more models anticipated in 2026. In North America, the Ram Rampage, a compact pickup truck that has seen success in South American markets, is officially confirmed for release, aiming to compete in a growing segment.

M&A Potential

While Stellantis is open to strategic portfolio adjustments, recent reports of a potential merger with Renault Group have been explicitly denied by both Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares and Renault CEO Luca de Meo, who labeled them as ""pure speculation.""

However, Stellantis is currently conducting a strategic review of its portfolio assets, indicating potential divestitures. The company is considering selling its Free2move car-sharing business as part of a plan to exit unprofitable ventures and re-focus investments on core assets, particularly in the profitable U.S. market. Furthermore, Stellantis has engaged McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice regarding the performance of its Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, although Maserati is not currently for sale. A new comprehensive business plan resulting from this broader review is expected to be presented to investors in the first quarter of 2026.

Near-Term Events (as of 10/4/2025)

Earnings: Stellantis is scheduled to announce its Q3 2025 Shipments and Revenues on October 30, 2025. The company's Q4 2025 earnings report, covering the full year 2025, is estimated to be released around March 4, 2026.

Launches: A robust pipeline of new models is expected in late 2025 and 2026:

The return of the Hemi V-8 engine in certain Ram models is anticipated.

The all-new 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack, available with a twin-turbo 3.0-liter Hurricane I6 engine and an all-electric Daytona Scat Pack variant, is launching.

The redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring a turbocharged 1.6-liter HYBRID I4 engine, is making its debut.

The Ram Rampage compact pickup is entering the North American market.

The next-generation Dodge Durango, built on the STLA Large platform, will offer various powertrains including the Hurricane I6, a BEV version, and potentially a plug-in hybrid (PHEV).

The Jeep Comanche, a new off-road-focused compact pickup, is slated for release.

A new Chrysler SUV built on the STLA Large platform is also expected.

The Leapmotor C10 range-extended electric SUV will be launched in South Africa in 2025.

Potential Catalysts for Growth

Key catalysts for Stellantis's growth include sustaining the positive sales momentum in the U.S. for its high-margin Jeep and Ram brands. The successful integration of AI across operations is expected to enhance efficiency and customer experience. A strong market reception for its diverse lineup of new vehicle launches, spanning ICE, hybrid, and electric powertrains, will be crucial. The successful execution of its adjusted, more flexible electrification strategy could better align with market demands. Furthermore, expansion into African markets and the performance of the Leapmotor joint venture represent new revenue streams. Finally, a positive outcome from the strategic review, including shedding unprofitable assets like Free2move and presenting a compelling new business plan in early 2026, could significantly boost investor confidence and financial performance, with the company projecting low-single-digit Adjusted Operating Income profitability for the second half of 2025.

Retail Chatter

Retail investor sentiment on Stellantis (STLA) has shown recent improvement. On October 3, 2025, retail sentiment on Stocktwits was trending ""bullish,"" although message volume had fallen to ""normal"" from ""high"" levels. Just a day earlier, on October 1, 2025, retail sentiment on Stocktwits had risen from ""bearish"" to ""neutral"" territory, following news of Stellantis expanding its partnership with Mistral AI. Discussions on platforms like Moomoo and Investing.com show varied opinions, with some investors seeing the stock as ""extremely cheap"" and a ""buy"" opportunity, while others express frustration over past declines.

Overall Sentiment as of 10/4/2025

The overall sentiment around Stellantis is currently complex. While analysts generally lean towards a ""Hold"" or ""Reduce"" rating, recent developments have injected positive momentum. The company saw a significant surge in its stock price, rising 7-8% in early October, driven by a robust 6% increase in U.S. sales for Q3 2025, marking its first positive sales quarter in two years. This sales rebound, coupled with an expanded AI partnership with Mistral AI, has boosted investor confidence and contributed to an uptick in retail sentiment. However, the company still faces financial challenges, including declining margins, high debt levels, and ongoing profitability concerns, as reflected by its negative operating and net margins in the first half of 2025. Stellantis has also been involved in lobbying efforts regarding potential tariffs on its Mexico-produced Ram pickups, with Ford and GM reportedly lobbying against Stellantis's request for a waiver or reduction. Despite these challenges, the Q3 sales figures are seen as a critical turning point and a potential catalyst for a strategic recovery. The company expects to report its Q3 2025 shipments and revenues on October 30, 2025, and its 2025 financial guidance remains unchanged.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex and challenging landscape of regulatory, policy, and geopolitical factors as of October 2025. These factors significantly impact its operations, financial performance, and strategic direction, particularly regarding its transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and global manufacturing footprint.

Regulatory and Policy Factors:

US Tariffs and Trade Policies:

Impact: Stellantis is facing substantial financial headwinds from new US tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. The company projects a €1.2 billion (USD 1.4 billion) to €1.5 billion (USD 1.6 billion) impact in the second half of 2025, following a €300 million impact in the first half. These tariffs, which include a 25% duty on assembled vehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico, took effect on April 3, 2025. Imports from Europe also face levies, though some were deferred. These tariffs have led to a 23% drop in North American deliveries and a €2.3 billion net loss in H1 2025 for Stellantis. The tariffs are also forcing Stellantis to reassess its production footprint, with temporary layoffs at US plants and suspended production at Canadian and Mexican facilities.

Strategy: Stellantis is trying to adapt by adjusting manufacturing levels and reducing vehicle shipments. The company's reliance on integrated North American supply chains has become a liability, pushing for a shift towards domestic resilience in the automotive sector. CEO Antonio Filosa, appointed in May 2025, is tasked with revamping product ranges and regaining market share and investor confidence amidst these challenges.

EU CO2 Emission Regulations:

Impact: The EU has implemented stricter CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and vans, effective from January 1, 2025. New cars and vans registered in the EU must emit 15% less CO2 compared to 2021 targets, equating to an average target of 93.6 g CO2/km for cars. Manufacturers face financial penalties of €95 per g/km of target exceedance for every car sold. Stellantis's Europe chief, Jean-Philippe Imparato, has called these targets ""unrealistic"" and stated that the company faces potential fines of up to $2.95 billion, possibly leading to factory closures if regulatory changes are not made. While Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares initially stated the company was prepared for these targets, the reality of market conditions suggests otherwise.

Strategy: In response to industry lobbying, the European Commission proposed an amendment on April 1, 2025, to allow automakers to meet 2025-2027 CO2 targets based on a three-year average rather than annually, providing some flexibility. Stellantis aims for 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe by 2030. Despite the challenges, Stellantis appears to be ""well on track"" for its 2025 EU CO2 targets, with a compliance gap of less than 5 gCO2/km based on 2023 emissions. The company, along with Renault, is also advocating for a new category of smaller, less-regulated ""e-cars"" in Europe to compete with cheaper Chinese EVs, arguing that current safety regulations make small cars unprofitable.

Government Incentives for EVs:

Impact: The federal EV tax credit of $7,500 in the US officially expired on September 30, 2025. This has led Stellantis to reduce production of electric and plug-in hybrid cars for the US market, aligning production with anticipated demand after the loss of incentives.

Strategy: To counteract the expiration of the federal tax credit, Stellantis is replicating the $7,500 incentive with its own bonus cash offers for eligible EVs and PHEVs in dealer inventory, including models like the Jeep Wagoneer S, Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, Dodge Charger Daytona EV, Dodge Hornet R/T PHEV, Chrysler Pacifica PHEV, and Alfa Romeo Tonale. This strategy aims to maintain sales momentum for its electrified offerings.

Opportunities: Stellantis received a commitment of up to $7.54 billion from the US government to build two EV battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana, through its joint venture with Samsung SDI, StarPlus Energy LLC. This aligns with the Biden administration's push to strengthen domestic EV supply chains and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. Stellantis plans to invest over $35 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development, welcoming consumer incentives, increased public charging infrastructure, and support for US R&D and manufacturing as critical steps for a robust EV ecosystem.

Geopolitical Risks and Opportunities:

US-China Trade Tensions and Competition:

Risks: US tariffs are hitting the entire auto sector, including Stellantis, with a 25% tariff on auto imports and additional duties on aluminum, steel, and parts. Stellantis has faced production cuts and layoffs in North America due to these tariffs. The company is also directly impacted by China's rare earth export policies, as these materials are crucial for EV components, creating supply chain disruptions. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has warned about the ""major trap"" of tariffs on Chinese EVs in Europe and the US, stating it could force Western automakers to restructure to compete with lower-cost Chinese manufacturers, with potential severe social consequences. There are concerns that China will produce more vehicles than Europe and the United States combined by 2025, intensifying competition.

Opportunities/Strategy: Stellantis is considering pulling out of car manufacturing in China and instead importing vehicles from the US or Europe, adopting an ""asset-light"" business model to reduce fixed costs and limit exposure to geopolitical risks. This shift is also driven by local competitors like BYD and Geely gaining market share in China's EV segment. Stellantis is supporting a US startup, Niron Magnetics, to develop and produce magnets without rare-earth elements, aiming to reduce dependence on China's supply chain for critical minerals.

Global Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:

Risks: Stellantis's reliance on a global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions from geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics, which can impact production capabilities and financial performance. The US tariffs have specifically exposed the fragility of Stellantis's integrated North American supply chains, leading to plant halts and layoffs.

Strategy: The company is strategically adapting by prioritizing supply chain flexibility and demand alignment. This includes reevaluating its North American sourcing strategy and potentially reshoring operations or expanding North American supplier networks. Stellantis's Manufacturing and Supply Chain department is focused on optimizing logistics, mode, and capacity, and collaborating with suppliers for sustainable practices, including using recyclable or reusable packaging.

EU's Industrial Policy and Chinese Competition:

Risks: European rules are making cars more complex, heavier, and expensive, hindering Stellantis and Renault's ability to produce affordable vehicles and maintain market share against Chinese rivals. The EU's carbon regulation also imposes an ""unrealistic path to electrification"" for Stellantis, detached from market realities, with inadequate charging infrastructure and removed purchase incentives slowing EV transition.

Strategy: Stellantis is urging the EU to ease regulations and has actively lobbied for a new category of smaller, less-regulated electric vehicles (""e-cars"") in Europe to better compete with affordable Chinese EVs entering the market. The company is also pursuing an ""extended electrification"" (xEV) strategy, encompassing ICE, PHEVs, and BEVs, using its STLA platform to consolidate production and offer flexibility to respond to regional demand and regulatory shifts, in contrast to some rivals' pure BEV focus.

In summary, Stellantis is actively adapting its operations and strategy to a dynamic global environment. It is grappling with significant financial impacts from US tariffs, pushing it to re-evaluate its North American manufacturing and supply chain. In Europe, it faces stringent CO2 emission targets, prompting calls for regulatory flexibility and a diversified electrification strategy. Geopolitically, the rise of Chinese competition and supply chain dependencies on critical minerals are driving Stellantis to explore new manufacturing models and partnerships to secure raw materials and maintain competitiveness. The company's future success hinges on its ability to navigate these complex challenges while executing its electrification goals and maintaining profitability across its diverse brand portfolio.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 4, 2025, marked by strategic pivots towards electrification and software, recent leadership changes, and mixed financial performance. While the company has shown a significant rebound in U.S. sales, it continues to face financial headwinds and external challenges.

Recent Performance (as of Q3 2025)

Stellantis concluded the third quarter of 2025 with strong sales momentum in the U.S., reporting a 6% year-over-year increase in vehicle sales, totaling 324,825 units. This performance marks a significant turning point, snapping a prolonged streak of eight consecutive quarters of declining sales for its American subsidiary, FCA US. September sales were particularly robust, climbing 16% compared to the same month last year. Commercial fleet sales also saw a notable 22% increase.

Key brand performance highlights in the U.S. for Q3 2025 include:

Jeep®: Sales surged 11%, with the Wrangler up 18%, the Gladiator jumping 43%, and the Wagoneer posting an impressive 122% gain. The Wrangler 4xe continues to be America's best-selling Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), with the Grand Cherokee 4xe holding the No. 3 spot.

Ram: Retail sales increased by 26% in Q3, largely driven by the return of the HEMI® V8 in the Ram 1500. Light-duty trucks saw a 10% climb.

Chrysler: Experienced an astounding 45% increase in total sales, with Pacifica sales up 49% and Voyager sales up 65%.

FIAT: Also contributed positively with a modest 2% sales gain.

Despite this sales rebound, Stellantis's financial performance for the first half of 2025 revealed a net loss of €2.3 billion and a 12.7% year-over-year decline in revenue to €74.26 billion. The second quarter (Q2 2025) saw a significant miss on earnings per share (EPS) expectations at -0.78, although revenue slightly exceeded forecasts at €38.4 billion. Consolidated shipments globally for Q2 2025 declined by 7% year-over-year.

Stellantis's stock has faced challenges, being down 20% since the start of 2025 and losing about two-thirds of its value since March 2024. However, the strong Q3 U.S. sales report on October 2, 2025, led to an 8% surge in its stock price, reflecting renewed investor optimism. The company maintains a sturdy cash position of approximately $36.04 billion.

Future Plans and Strategic Pivots

Under new CEO Antonio Filosa, who took the helm in June 2025, and with the recent appointment of Joao Laranjo as CFO on September 30, 2025, Stellantis is executing several strategic initiatives:

Electrification and Software (Dare Forward 2030): Stellantis plans to invest over €30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development. The company aims for a 100% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) passenger car sales mix in Europe and a 50% BEV passenger car and light-duty truck sales mix in the U.S. by 2030. To support this, Stellantis is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity by 2030 through five ""gigafactories"" in North America and Europe.

On September 27, 2025, Stellantis unveiled its Intelligent Battery Integrated System (IBIS) prototype, developed with Saft, aiming for 10% greater efficiency than similar EV batteries and potential production by the end of the decade.

The company is launching new electrified models, including a future electrified Jeep Wagoneer by the end of 2025. The Ram 1500 REV (all-electric pickup) launched in late 2024, and the range-extended 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger will be built alongside internal combustion engine (ICE) models.

U.S. Manufacturing Investments: Stellantis is making a multi-billion dollar investment in its U.S. operations. This includes building the next-generation Dodge Durango at its Detroit Assembly Complex, reopening the idled Belvidere plant in 2027 to produce a new midsize pickup truck, and enhancing its Toledo Assembly Complex for Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Investments are also planned for Kokomo facilities to produce the GME-T4 EVO engine starting in 2026.

“Really understanding this load forecasting with the investor-owned utility is going to be so important because affordability is such a challenge right now,” Mitchell said.","Tackling the Affordability Challenge

How can we keep the lights on without breaking the bank? That question was front and center this May as energy leaders from across California gathered in Irvine for the CalCCA Annual Conference.

At the heart of the conference was a powerhouse plenary panel, “Brass Tacks: CCA CEOs on the Industry’s Current State and Future Direction,” featuring five CalCCA board members. Moderated by Robert Shaw, CEO of Central Coast Community Energy, the panelists pulled no punches about the state of the energy industry and how their organizations are planning for the future.

As these executives see it, the path forward requires more than clean energy. It demands grit, foresight, and a laser focus on keeping costs in check for the Californians who need it most.

“You’re seeing real stories of folks once a month having to figure out whether they want to pay their electric bill or fill up the pantry with groceries. It’s a real issue,” said Don Eckert, CEO of Pioneer Community Energy. “People are suffering with the high energy prices that continue to go up.”

Electricity costs are a primary concern for Pioneer, despite saving its customers $108 million since 2018 and maintaining the lowest residential generation rates in California. While Pioneer achieves this by offering a 10% discount on average compared to PG&E’s electricity generation rates, Eckert noted, it is hard to make that felt when the majority of customer electricity bill charges are for transmission, distribution, and other costs that CCAs do not control. “We’ve been very aggressive in our discount to PG&E,” Eckert said, “but to be real, we’re only a third of the bill.”

Being Proactive Is Key

In strategizing how to achieve manageable bills, the CEOs repeatedly touched on the idea of being proactive in securing cost-effective clean energy resources and managing risks. Ted Bardacke, CEO of Clean Power Alliance (CPA), relayed how his agency made the decision to take a share of the risk in its recent request for offers for renewable energy contracts.

Facing uncertainties from tariffs and the status of Inflation Reduction Act credits, CPA decided to incorporate price-flexibility language into its contracts with developers. The language allows for a moderate change in contract price if tariffs are higher or lower than expected when the primary equipment to build an agreed-upon energy project arrives. This means that a project could end up being slightly more or less expensive for CPA, but it also incentivizes developers to work with CPA even during these uncertain times, helping to avoid price increases from a lack of available energy resources.

Bardacke highlighted that CPA developed this strategy proactively. CPA “didn’t just say ‘Developers, come tell us what you want.’” Instead, Bardacke said, “We’re going to take the pen, we’re going to put out a standard pro forma that talks about the risks we would like to share.”

Lori Mitchell, director of San José Clean Energy (SJCE), echoed the importance of forward-looking action to handle uncertainties, particularly around the rise of data centers and similar large loads in SJCE’s area. “You’re talking at least 100 MW,” Mitchell said of some large commercial customers. “It’s something that you have to procure in advance for; PG&E needs to build out that distribution infrastructure to serve them. So, we’ve really taken a proactive approach of partnering with PG&E to make sure that happens.”

For CCAs, preparing for significant load growth is key to preventing unexpected cost or service shifts for all customers. “Really understanding this load forecasting with the investor-owned utility is going to be so important because affordability is such a challenge right now,” Mitchell said. “And when you have these large-load customers coming on line, the last thing all of us want to do is to buy it before they’re actually there and using this load, right? Because then we potentially have invested in supply that we don’t need.”

Turning Challenges into Opportunities

With proper foresight, CCA leaders view challenges and risks as avenues of opportunity. Mitchell pointed out that the 100 MW procurements further the economies of scale that CCAs have already achieved by procuring for their smaller customers. Larger loads to procure means having to find more energy to contract, but it also means having more negotiating power and leverage when creating contracts. Additionally, Mitchell noted, some large customers can shift load from one data center to another in minutes, which means they can be a strong tool for demand response and relieving pressure on the grid.

San Diego Community Power (SDCP) is also capitalizing on challenges, as evidenced by its recent launch of the San Diego Regional Energy Network (SDREN). The new network provides programs “designed to make energy efficiency and electrification more accessible and affordable,” according to SDCP CEO Karin Burns. It also may fill future voids given San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has signaled plans to exit energy efficiency programs.

SDREN is poised to generate $124.3 million in energy efficiency resources for the region through 2027.

Managed by SDCP and the County of San Diego, SDREN will administer 10 programs that aim to facilitate residential and business energy efficiency upgrades, workforce training in green careers, and reduction of customer energy bills. “We’re really focused on launching the REN and making it successful,” Burns said.

Indeed, while the road ahead won’t be easy, CCAs are looking forward and charting courses to find the best ways to meet the needs of their customers and provide them with affordable, clean, and reliable energy.

In concluding the panel, Shaw remarked how, in the CCA world, “There are a ton of challenges, and I think the wonderful opportunity that you’ve heard from each of these four is each of those challenges really is an opportunity to engage.”",https://cal-cca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-22-CalCCA_Logo_400x400_Cleaned-Up-Simplified-on-Green.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 15:59:58.812171

For Stellantis, the strategy is clear—keep EVs and PHEVs attractive while the brand ramps up its electrification lineup and works to win back U.S. market share.","Stellantis (FCA US) is giving American car buyers a bit more breathing room in the electric (EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) market. Despite the official expiration of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, the automaker has confirmed to the Detroit Free Press that it will continue to honor the incentive on eligible models—at least through the end of 2025, as long as dealer inventory lasts.

This move comes as Stellantis tries to regain ground in the U.S. market. The company posted its best quarter in years, with sales climbing 6% year-over-year in Q3 2025 to 324,825 units. Chrysler, Jeep®, and FIAT all contributed to the gain, with Jeep carrying much of the load thanks to surging demand for the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEVs.

The Jeep Wrangler 4xe has been the nation’s best-selling PHEV, helping Stellantis sell more than 128,000 Wranglers so far this year. Meanwhile, the all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S hit 4,163 deliveries in Q3 alone, bringing its 2025 total to over 10,000. The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona and Hornet R/T PHEV, Chrysler’s Pacifica Hybrid, and Alfa Romeo’s Tonale PHEV also qualify for the temporary credit extension.

There is a catch, however. Unlike the original IRS tax credit, Stellantis’ program only applies to vehicles already sitting in dealer stock. Once those units are sold, the incentive disappears unless the company renews it. Stellantis is referring to the benefit as “bonus cash,” which is applied directly to the transaction price, making it functionally identical to the old federal rebate.

By stepping in, Stellantis joins rivals Ford, General Motors (GM), and Hyundai, which also pledged to help buyers offset the loss of federal incentives. For Stellantis, the strategy is clear—keep EVs and PHEVs attractive while the brand ramps up its electrification lineup and works to win back U.S. market share.

For now, customers eyeing a new Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, or Alfa Romeo electrified model still have access to a deal that keeps them in the game—at least until inventories run out.

The Trump administration, citing an ongoing “energy emergency,” is saddling a community already overburdened by pollution with a dirty, obsolete power plant it doesn’t want or need. The decision has confounded residents and environmental justice advocates, who called the move an abuse of federal law and a lost opportunity to improve the area’s air quality.

The Department of Energy issued [pdf] what’s called an emergency “stay open” order for Constellation Energy’s gas-fired power plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, on August 27. It is the second time since May the agency has taken this step, and amounts to “an extraordinary and unprecedented” use of the Federal Power Act (FPA), said Robert Routh of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The FPA gives the United States federal government authority to regulate interstate electricity sales, hydropower projects, and parts of the power grid to ensure reliable and fair access to electricity.

The NRDC, along with the Sierra Club, PennFuture, and several other environmental groups, is challenging the decision. Emergency stay open orders have previously been reserved for wartime conditions or natural disasters, said Routh, who is the Pennsylvania policy director for the organization. “This is an abuse of an extraordinary authority reserved for emergency situations,” he said, noting that the short-term need for increased electricity the administration cited in defending the move would not justify keeping the facility open. “They are concocting the emergency situation in order to justify keeping a dirty fossil plant online past its retirement date.”

Eddystone lies just outside Philadelphia, at the head of a 12-mile industrial corridor that stretches to the town of Marcus Hook and is generally considered one of the most toxic areas in the state. Today, it’s home to myriad hazardous industries, including the nation’s largest trash incinerator, chemical plants, and refineries. Childhood asthma rates in the region are four times the national average, and the rates of some forms of cancer are more than 1,000 percent higher.

Constellation Energy’s gas plant in Eddystone began operation in the early 1960s and currently provides about 782 megawatts to the surrounding region. It has run only sporadically in recent years, in large part because it simply was not economical to operate consistently. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it emitted 23,102 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, 16 tons of methane, and 31 tons of nitrous oxide. Grid operator PJM approved Constellation’s shutdown request for the plant in December of 2023 after finding that the closure would not adversely impact the grid, and the facility was scheduled to close May 31. But, one day before the closure, the Department of Energy, or DOE, ordered the plant to continue operating. The agency reissued that order when it expired last week.

Although environmental advocates argue the emergency order is a manufactured crisis, the DOE cited summer heat waves as the rationale for keeping the plant open, noting that the “Eddystone units were called on by PJM to generate electricity during heat waves that hit the region in June and July.” The grid operator did not respond when asked if closing the plant would have caused blackouts—something that would not have been considered in its decision to approve the facility’s closure, because PJM cannot deny a closure solely on those grounds. But PJM said it supported extending the emergency order. Constellation Energy pointed to the rapid expansion of the data centres powering artificial intelligence, saying that it is “continuing to work with the Department of Energy and PJM in taking emergency measures to meet the need for power at this critical time when America must win the AI race.”

In July, Trump and Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick announced the private sector had promised $90 billion in funding to turn Pennsylvania into a hub for data centres. This has drawn concern from environmental advocates, who worry that the promise of corporate investment will provide a handy excuse to prolong the life of oil and liquid natural gas in order to generate electricity for hypothetical data centres.

“We have not yet seen that demand that everyone is talking about from the data centres,” said Jessica O’Neill, managing attorney at PennFuture, an environmental advocacy nonprofit. “In Pennsylvania, we just seem to fall over ourselves, again and again, to attract new industry.” Her concern, she explained, was that the state would build speculative gas plants or extend the life of aging plants in the service of an industry that might never materialize.

When Constellation’s shutdown request was approved almost two years ago, the grid operator noted that the plant’s closure would not cause “any reliability violations,” or leave the region at risk of blackouts. Both Routh and O’Neill noted that PJM’s interconnection crisis has left many renewable energy projects in limbo as they wait to be brought onto the grid. Despite the administration’s dire warnings of an energy emergency, it has moved aggressively to shut down renewable energy projects that would provide more electricity.

“I personally think it’s interesting that they’re justifying the stay open order on the grounds that there’s an energy emergency, because that has not been shown to be the case,” said Lauren Minsky, a medical historian and professor of environmental health at Haverford College. “And what there clearly is, is a public health emergency.” As part of her work, Minsky has been tracking community cancer rates in the industrial stretch between Eddystone and Marcus Hook. Pediatric Hodgkin’s Lymphoma rates in Eddystone are 1,051 percent higher than the national average; youth uterine cancer rates are 1,813 percent higher.

The emergency stay open order will likely increase costs for ratepayers, Routh explained. Because the order came down just a day before the plant was to retire, Constellation Energy had to abruptly order an enormous amount of fuel and tackle deferred maintenance it never expected to deal with. “Those costs are going to be shifted to ratepayers,” said Routh. “Whereas this plant otherwise would not have been operating. This is an unprecedented use of this authority, and it’s done in a way that doesn’t make sense even on its own face.”

DMR Technologies will create 521 jobs over the next decade with an average salary of $85,000 to produce agricultural drones for the American market.

The move comes as U.S. drone manufacturers face pressure to prove they can compete with cheaper Chinese imports while meeting growing demand for NDAA-compliant domestic production. For drone operators watching the industry shift toward American-made aircraft, DMR’s Louisiana gamble represents a significant test case.

Lafayette Facility to Produce Field Ranger X50 Agricultural Drones

DMR Technologies, headquartered in Houston with offices in Detroit, will renovate a 10,000-square-foot facility on Dorset Avenue in Lafayette to serve as its primary domestic production hub. The facility will integrate flight control printing, rotor manufacturing, assembly, quality control, and logistics staging under one roof.

The company plans to produce 500 to 1,000 Field Ranger X50 drones by the end of 2025. The Field Ranger X50 is an agricultural spray drone with a 50-liter (13.2-gallon) tank capacity designed for precision agriculture, industrial inspection, environmental monitoring, and delivery applications.

“Louisiana has proven to be an ideal partner,” DMR Technologies Co-founder and CEO David Wang said. “Lafayette offers us the talent, infrastructure and policy environment we need to ramp up quickly and operate with efficiency.”

High-Paying Jobs and State Incentives Seal the Deal

Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will create 521 direct jobs plus 766 indirect positions, totaling 1,287 new opportunities in the Acadiana region. The $85,000 average salary represents 151% of the Lafayette Parish average wage, qualifying DMR for Louisiana’s High Impact Jobs Program.

To secure the facility, Louisiana offered a competitive package including a $1 million performance-based grant for building renovations and equipment costs, LED FastStart workforce development solutions, and potential Industrial Tax Exemption benefits. The state will provide grants covering up to 22% of employee pay through the High Impact Jobs Program.

“This is exactly the type of project that delivers lasting opportunity for our people and communities,” Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said.

Building on Local Partnership with SoLA Drones

DMR already maintains a partnership with SoLA Drones, a Lafayette-based drone retailer founded in 2023 that specializes in agricultural applications throughout South Louisiana. The company also has distribution partners in nearby Scott, Alabama, Kentucky, and Michigan.

“Being located in Louisiana gives us a strong logistics footprint to serve both U.S. and international clients,” DMR Technologies Co-founder and Head of U.S. Operations Ryan Case said. “With the launch of our Lafayette facility, we’re eliminating lead time issues and delivering next-day fulfillment for many of our U.S. customers.”

Production Timeline and Economic Impact

Renovations are currently underway at the facility, with production scheduled to begin by the end of 2025. The Lafayette operation will house engineering and compliance teams, quality testing spaces, an on-site warehouse, and logistics staging areas.

Lafayette Mayor-President Monique B. Boulet emphasized the economic diversification benefits. “By updating an existing facility, DMR Technologies is reinvesting in part of our community while keeping costs low,” she said.

DroneXL’s Take

DMR Technologies is entering the U.S. manufacturing arena at a pivotal moment. President Trump’s June 2025 executive order “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” calls for prioritizing U.S.-manufactured drones across federal agencies, creating potential opportunities for domestic manufacturers. But the order alone doesn’t guarantee success.

American drone manufacturers face a harsh reality: insufficient commercial and government procurement demand remains the biggest barrier to scaling domestic production, as industry leaders acknowledged at XPONENTIAL 2025. Companies like Skydio, AeroVironment, and BRINC have struggled to match the price-performance ratio of Chinese competitors, particularly DJI’s dominance in the agricultural drone market.

DMR’s strategy of focusing on agricultural drones makes sense. The ag sector represents a large addressable market where American farmers increasingly face pressure to avoid Chinese-made equipment for food security and data privacy reasons. By partnering with existing Louisiana agricultural networks through SoLA Drones, DMR has built-in distribution and market knowledge.

However, critical questions remain unanswered: Is the Field Ranger X50 NDAA-compliant? How will DMR’s pricing compare to DJI’s Agras T50, which dominates the agricultural spray drone market? Can 500-1,000 units per year generate sufficient revenue to sustain 521 employees long-term?

The Louisiana location offers genuine logistics advantages for serving U.S. customers, and the state’s $1 million investment plus tax incentives reduce DMR’s upfront risk. But ultimately, DMR’s success depends on whether American farmers and commercial operators will pay a premium for domestic manufacturing—or continue buying cheaper imported alternatives until regulatory restrictions force their hand.

This is a bet worth watching. If DMR can prove the economics work for agricultural drones, it could pave the way for broader domestic manufacturing across other drone segments.

Among those affected is major electric utility Portland General Electric (PGE), which says it has lost $50 million in grants across three projects aimed at improving the reliability of the region’s electrical grid. A spokesperson said the utility is evaluating all options, including filing appeals.

The Sept. 29 release builds on President Donald Trump’s day-one executive order on energy development and follows Congress’s 2023 and 2025 amendments to NEPA, as well as the Supreme Court’s May decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County.

“There’s been a consensus across all three branches of government that we need permitting reform. Now, at the direction of President Trump, Federal agencies have a clear and consistent roadmap to get us there,” said CEQ Chairman Katherine Scarlett. She called the initiative “the greatest permitting reform ever to take place in the 55-year history of NEPA.”

What Changed

Old regulations rescinded: In April 2025, CEQ formally rescinded its binding NEPA regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500–1508. Agencies must now rely on their own procedures, developed in consultation with CEQ.

New guidance is non-binding: The Sept. 29 guidance provides a framework and “roadmap” but does not have the force of law. CEQ emphasized that agencies retain flexibility to tailor their procedures.

Template for agencies: The Appendix provides a model for drafting NEPA procedures, covering areas such as categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, public involvement, and interagency coordination.

Congressional amendments incorporated:

• The 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act introduced deadlines, page limits, and broader use of programmatic reviews and categorical exclusions.

• The 2025 amendments added a “Project Sponsor Opt-in Fee” provision, allowing private sponsors to pay fees in exchange for expedited review deadlines.

Supreme Court ruling applied: The Seven County decision clarified that NEPA is procedural, not substantive, and limited agencies’ obligation to analyze remote or speculative effects, directing courts to defer to reasonable agency judgments.

National and Local Impact

Federal officials argue the reforms could shorten review times that have sometimes exceeded actual construction timelines. CEQ says the changes will help major infrastructure projects move forward more quickly, from highways to pipelines to housing developments.

In Texas, where highway expansions, energy projects, and large-scale housing are frequently subject to lengthy environmental reviews, the reforms could reduce bottlenecks if agencies adopt the new framework and sponsors utilize the opt-in fee system.

Critics Respond

Environmental groups warn that compressed timelines may weaken safeguards for communities and natural resources. Legal analysts also note that, with CEQ’s regulations rescinded, agencies have wide discretion, raising the potential for inconsistent standards and more litigation.

CEQ maintains that the reforms preserve NEPA’s core protections while bringing overdue modernization and efficiency to a process that had not been comprehensively revised in decades.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trump_NEPA_permitting_reform-Canva.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 14:02:06.148184

Additionally, it secured a new financing arm to deliver crucial funding for large-scale projects. A growing demand for clean and green hydrogen has been evident in the global market, and by acquiring Ambient Fuels, Electric Hydrogen has positioned itself as a potential market leader in the hydrogen sector. Hydrogen remains the most viable and sustainable energy resource on the planet.

The deal represents a match made in hydrogen heaven

Electric Hydrogen is one of the world’s leading electrolyzer manufacturers, and Ambient Fuels was a global leader in hydrogen project development, so the acquisition by Electric Hydrogen could not have been set up better. It’s a marriage of two of the biggest players in the hydrogen game. The deal will strengthen the company’s ability to partner with customers on the co-development of hydrogen projects, as well as provide crucial funding where deemed necessary.

As part of the deal, Electric Hydrogen agreed to enter into a strategic relationship with Generate Capital, a former investor in Ambient Fuels and a leading infrastructure investment platform. The former CEO of Ambient Fuels praised the acquisition by Electric Hydrogen and underscored the growing demand for American-made products in the energy sector overall.

“We’re thrilled to join the Electric Hydrogen team. With this unique project finance capability from Generate Capital, our team is well positioned to support Electric Hydrogen customers who prefer to buy renewable hydrogen as a process input rather than building and operating their own renewable hydrogen plants. We believe this is a key ‘unlock’ for the nascent renewable hydrogen and renewable fuels industries that will help customers get to scale faster, enabled by Electric Hydrogen’s leading technology.” – Jacob Susman, former CEO of Ambient Fuels now leading project development at Electric Hydrogen

The acquisition opens up new avenues for exploration for Electric Hydrogen

It’s rare for a business acquisition to make this much sense. Electric Hydrogen made a masterful move by sealing the deal to purchase Ambient Fuels, which will now enable the company to diversify its portfolio as well as invest, originate, and develop new projects across the globe. The deal offers Electric Hydrogen up to $400 million in hydrogen project finance solutions that they can choose to allocate where they deem necessary.

Not to be left behind, Generate Capital also released a statement that underscores the importance of hydrogen financing across the globe.

“Generate Capital is determined to accelerate the transition to low-carbon molecules by offering leading project finance capabilities in close collaboration with skilled developers and innovative technologies. Working with Electric Hydrogen, we can help solve current finance and bankability challenges and reduce LCOH, enabling more hydrogen projects to reach Final Investment Decision.” – Scott Gosselink, Managing Director at Generate Capital

Lastly, and most crucially, Electric Hydrogen released a statement that outlines its perception of the acquisition.

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead, supported in part by the RED-III compliance framework in the E.U. and the 45V hydrogen production tax credit in the U.S. We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers. We’re excited to add this new capability with Ambient Fuels and Generate Capital.” – Raffi Garabedian, CEO and Co-founder of Electric Hydrogen

Shortly after, the U.S. Arctic Research Commission​, an independent federal agency, released ​a report ​o​n Arctic priorities that emphasized military​, community, economic and energy security.
That report will inform the forthcoming national Arctic research plan, which would steer science in the region for five years beginning in 2027.
It is “specifically aimed at national security,” Cheryl Rosa, the deputy director of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, said at a September meeting.
The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, has funded the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, for nearly 40 years.","The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet and is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth. And the United States’ approach to Arctic research has also begun shifting.

Instead of focusing largely on climate and environmental science, the Trump administration appears to be pivoting research efforts toward military and defense interests.

“It’s a radical shift,” said Michael Walsh, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “They frame everything through the lens of national security.”

President Trump showed his interest in the Arctic region within his first months back in office. He has said the U.S. would go “as far as we have to go” to control Greenland and announced intentions to order new icebreaker ships.

He has also issued executive orders to fast track oil and gas developments in Alaska and to “ensure the security and leadership of Arctic waterways.”

In May, a government committee took the unusual step of ​editing a Biden-era planning document to “align with the current administration’s policies.” The revised version no longer included the words “climate change,” a main focus of work there for decades. It also appeared to downgrade the value placed on research contributions from nearby Indigenous communities.

Shortly after, the U.S. Arctic Research Commission​, an independent federal agency, released ​a report ​o​n Arctic priorities that emphasized military​, community, economic and energy security. “The Arctic region is critical to the defense of our homeland, the protection of U.S. national sovereignty, and the fulfillment of our nation’s defense commitments,” one section reads.

That report will inform the forthcoming national Arctic research plan, which would steer science in the region for five years beginning in 2027. It is “specifically aimed at national security,” Cheryl Rosa, the deputy director of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, said at a September meeting.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

One of eight countries with territory in the Arctic, the U.S. has been a global leader in science in the region.

The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, has funded the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, for nearly 40 years. The consortium is a nonprofit organization that has coordinated Arctic research among an international network of scientists.

But after the Trump administration began cutting National Science Foundation grants, the consortium opted not to compete for the scarce remaining dollars and shut down on Sept. 30. Audrey Taylor, who served as director of the consortium, described that decision as “agonizing.”

The consortium had built support for places like the Toolik Field Station in Alaska, which is America’s largest research outpost in the region. It provides scientists with transportation, equipment and lodging that make studying the remote region possible.

The United States has funded other large science centers and long term monitoring projects in the region, including the Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, which is one of four U.S. facilities that measure the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. President Trump’s proposed budget would close down the observatory and cancel the lease for the longest running greenhouse gas measurement facility, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

But even as the administration steps away from climate science, it acknowledges environmental upheaval in the region.

Polar research is one of the government’s top budget priorities for 2027, according to a recently released memo by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. It said the United States was affected by “rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic,” and that agencies should invest in research and development that “assures America’s uncontested navigation and strategic utilization of the Arctic.”

Sea ice, which in the past would block ships from passing through the region most of the year, has been declining for nearly a half-century as concentrations of greenhouse gases from the burning of oil and gas has heated the planet. In March, satellites observed the smallest amount of winter sea ice ever recorded.

As a result, commercial ships have begun taking shortcuts through the Arctic. Although the Biden administration emphasized the changing climate as a concern, both the Biden and Trump administrations have described the increasing navigability of Arctic waters as a security issue and emerging economic opportunity.

Polar ice on land and sea helps deflect the sun’s heat back into space. The disappearance of ice exacerbates warming and raises sea levels around the world.

At the same time, the frozen layer of soil that covers much of the Arctic, known as permafrost, is thawing. This releases more planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as methane, and causes the terrain to sink, collapse, and in some cases, explode.

“The Arctic is the proverbial ‘canary in the coal mine,’” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. “Let alone the impacts on the people who live there, what happens in the Arctic affects the rest of the world.”

Bonnie Scheele, an Inupiaq reindeer herder in Nome, Alaska, worked with U.S. scientists associated with the now-ended Arctic Research Consortium to track some of the environmental changes happening in the region that are disrupting her community’s traditional lifestyle and diet.

Ms. Scheele was “sad and frustrated” by the closure of the consortium and worried about a gap in Indigenous collaboration in research. Often, she said, knowledge built up over centuries by Indigenous cultures is used by outsiders without acknowledgment or benefit to Native communities. “But this was different,” she said. “That’s what made it so special.”

“Any research that’s related to the Arctic is going to impact us and we want to be part of it from the very beginning,” said Julie Raymond-Yakoubian, the director of the Social Science Program at Kawerak, a tribal consortia that represents 20 tribes in the region and worked closely with the Arctic Research Consortium. “We are part of the research community, we’re not just looking in at it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/science/00cli-ARCTIC-PRIORITIES/00cli-ARCTIC-PRIORITIES-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 12:06:49.510335

And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade.
If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.","Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.

“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”

He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.

Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.

But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.

Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.

Here’s where the dots connect:

• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.

• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.

• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.

If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.

The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.

Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.

Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.

The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.

George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.

We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

MIAMI, FL, UNITED STATES, October 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Atlas Renewable Energy (“Atlas”), the largest solar company in Latin America and a regional leader in clean energy solutions for corporate clients, has been recognized by LatinFinance with three prestigious awards that highlight the company’s ability to deliver excellence and innovation in renewable energy across Latin America. The company was named Project Sponsor of the Year, received the award for Renewable Energy Financing of the Year (Power) for the R$1.5 billion financing of the Luiz Carlos Solar Complex in Brazil, and was honored with Energy Storage Financing of the Year for the US$510 million financing of Estepa I & II in Chile.

The Project Sponsor of the Year recognition reflects Atlas’ unique position as one of the largest Independent Power Producers (IPP) in Latin America capable of consistently delivering complex projects through trusted partnerships with large companies that require financial ingenuity and operational excellence. Over the past year, Atlas not only executed two of the most significant renewable energy financings in the region but also set new benchmarks for how solar and storage projects can be structured and financed at scale.

“We are honored to receive this award from such a prestigious institution. I believe these awards are more than just recognition, they are also an illustration of Atlas’ role in leading the energy transition in Latin America,” said Carlos Barrera, CEO of Atlas Renewable Energy. “By structuring financings of this scale and complexity, we are not only expanding clean power generation but also pioneering innovative concepts and models, from hybrid solar-plus-storage projects in Chile to sustainable debenture structures in Brazil, in order to keep offering our clients compelling solutions. I want to thank our team for their steadfast dedication and our partners for their trust in our company.”

Coordinated by Itaú BBA for the construction of the Luiz Carlos photovoltaic complex, Atlas secured a R$1.5 billion financing, of which R$750 million came from incentivized debentures under the Brazilian Law 12.431/2011 certified as “Green Debentures” by Sustainable Fitch. The remaining R$720 million was obtained through commercial notes. The project will have an installed capacity of 787 MWp and is set to enter commercial operations in 2025. Luiz Carlos has two PPAs, one with Votorantim Cimentos and another with Arcelor Mittal.

Marking Atlas’ largest financing to date, the company worked with top-tier financial institutions, including BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, DNB Bank, Scotiabank Chile, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the Bank of Nova Scotia to secure a US$510 million financing for the Estepa project in Chile. The project will be a hybrid system composed of a photovoltaic solar plant with an installed capacity of 215 MW and an estimated generation of 600 GWh per year. It will also feature two battery storage systems with a 418 MW capacity, equivalent to four hours of energy generation. The project will deliver clean energy to Codelco and Colbun, two key players in Chile’s mining and energy sector.

Together, these awards reaffirm Atlas Renewable Energy’s role as a trusted partner for investors, corporations and governments. They also represent the company’s consistent pursuit of excellence in financing and executing projects that are shaping Latin America’s energy landscape.

About the Iowa Biodiesel Board","ANKENY, IOWA (October 3, 2025) — Iowa Biodiesel Board Executive Director Grant Kimberley testified at the US Environmental Protection Agency’s public hearing on “small refinery exemptions” under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). He thanked the agency for proposing high volumes of biomass-based diesel in the next Renewable Volume Obligations, while urging them to fully reallocate all waived gallons.

“I will say this as plainly as I can: the future of biodiesel markets — and the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard — depend on EPA following through on its responsibility to reallocate 100 percent of all small refinery exemptions,” Kimberley told EPA officials. “Anything less creates uncertainty, undermines the program and hurts the very people this policy was designed to support.”

Kimberley emphasized the toll that delays have taken on producers and rural communities.

“Iowa is home to several independent biodiesel producers, and I want you to understand that they have been brought to their knees this year. Times are hard and the clock is ticking for a recovery of this American energy industry. These delays don’t just show up on paper — they translate into real losses for farmers, fuel producers, and rural economies across Iowa and the nation. It’s imperative EPA act before it’s too late.”

He outlined three priorities for the agency in his comments:

Honoring the promise: “The president pledged that no gallons waived would go unaccounted for. The draft rule falls short of that promise by even entertaining the idea of partial or zero reallocation. EPA must keep that commitment.”

Protecting program integrity: “The RFS only works if it is whole. Failing to reallocate 100 percent of waived gallons erodes confidence in the system and signals to investors and producers that federal energy policy can’t be trusted.”

Safeguarding rural economies: “Producers and farmers cannot shoulder another backdoor cut in demand — especially at a time when market certainty is desperately needed.”

“Full reallocation of all refinery exemptions is the only path forward that honors commitments, protects the integrity of the RFS, and sustains biodiesel’s role in America’s energy and agricultural economy,” Kimberley concluded.

“The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.” The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

(Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company delivering complete lifecycle solutions & technologies in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, announced today that its Clean Cycle II™ Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology has been deployed in Martin, Tennessee. The project, led by RPG Energy Group, was one of the most challenging — and rewarding — projects in its history: designing and delivering a waste heat recapture system using ORC technology for a Fortune 100 company. The project is one of the first of its kind in U.S. industrial manufacturing and sets a new benchmark for efficiency and corporate stewardship.

In today’s industrial landscape, corporations face relentless pressure to protect margins, reduce operating costs, and achieve environmental goals. One of the most overlooked threats to profitability is also one of the least visible: energy inefficiency. By bringing CETY’s technology to life in Martin, RPG proved that U.S. manufacturers can tackle these inefficiencies head-on and generate measurable returns.

Manufacturing plants release vast amounts of waste heat into the environment every day. For this Fortune 100 company , a recognized global leader in efficiency and sustainability, leaving that energy untapped was unacceptable. By working with CETY and RPG, they turned that liability into an opportunity — transforming waste heat into clean, usable electricity.

“The Martin project sets an example for industrial America. Waste heat recovery is complex, but it is achievable with the right partners, technology, and vision. RPG Energy Group is proud to have led this effort alongside CETY, paving the way for more projects that merge profitability, resilience, and sustainability,” said Jami Krynski, CEO of RPG.

“This installation demonstrates how industrial manufacturers can turn an untapped liability into a strategic advantage,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Our ORC solution not only reduces energy costs but also advances sustainability commitments — and it does so in a way that is replicable across industrial America.”

Partnership with RPG Energy Group

CETY partnered with RPG Energy Group to integrate the ORC system. RPG provided project development and integration support, guiding the process from feasibility through delivery. Together, the companies overcame the integration challenges that have historically slowed ORC adoption in the U.S.

“We value RPG’s role in bringing their expertise in development and integration,” Mahdi added. “This project reflects the strength of our combined efforts and the importance of collaboration in advancing clean energy solutions.”

Baxter plant.
If the risk at Alton Baker Park really is low, conducting some soil testing there should cost just a fraction of that.","How much would you pay for peace of mind?

It’s a question worth asking after Lookout Eugene-Springfield reported that 1,400 gallons of J.H. Baxter & Co.’s hazardous wood-preserving chemicals were buried in a long-defunct landfill beneath Alton Baker Park more than 50 years ago.

The J.H. Baxter plant in west Eugene produced railroad ties, telephone poles and other specialized wood products for eight decades. But years of investigations revealed that toxic chemicals from the plant had seeped into the soil of some nearby residents’ yards, possibly contributing to elevated cancer levels in the neighborhood.

State and federal environmental officials spent time in 2021 and 2022 collecting those soil samples from dozens of yards just north of the J.H. Baxter plant. In July, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the plant a Superfund site.

When Lookout asked about toxic chemicals buried at the former Day Island Landfill beneath the eastern portion of Alton Baker Park, neither the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality nor Lane County showed much interest in assuring the public that efforts to seal landfill waste from seeping into soil there have held up. That’s despite the fact that thousands of park visitors and trail runners traverse the iconic grounds each year.

The state and county should reconsider their stance. DEQ previously studied the landfill and found evidence of the same toxic chemical that triggered the Superfund designation, but concluded the risk to the public was low.

That testing was conducted all the way back in 1992.

We hope state and county officials are right that the cover of soil and vegetation between the landfill waste and surface has held up over the past 50 years. And to be clear, there’s no evidence presented to date that anyone visiting the park, running along Pre’s Trail or exploring the park’s natural area has experienced negative health effects.

But unlike the homes near the J.H. Baxter plant, where residents reported concerns for years, it’s trickier to pinpoint the risk in public spaces like parks, where far more people spend far shorter amounts of time. And while landfill coverings typically include a tarp-like impermeable liner in addition to soil and vegetation, no such liner is documented in assessments of the Day Island Landfill.

The redevelopment of former landfills into city parks is hardly unique across the United States, including in Eugene. Portions of Tugman Park in south Eugene were developed in the 1990s above a former municipal burning dump, with DEQ’s oversight.

But in numerous cases across the country, like in Berkeley, California, environmental researchers have found harmful chemicals in soil or water decades after landfills were redeveloped into parks. In César Chávez Park along Berkeley’s waterfront, elevated levels of radium were discovered in 2023, 30 years after it was converted from a landfill to a city park.

The Day Island Landfill was covered during an era of far less stringent environmental regulation than today. And research methodologies have evolved in the 30 years since soil was last tested there.

We think the state bears primary responsibility for conducting additional soil testing at the park. But even if DEQ will not step up, Lane County can. Lane County Public Health reports to the Board of County Commissioners. We call on the board to make its own determination. First priority: Convince the state to test soil above the landfill. And if the state won’t play ball, the county should explore other options, including paying for the tests itself, or splitting the costs with the state.

Officials are reluctant to estimate costs for testing the former landfill. DEQ says one or two tests likely wouldn’t be adequate to get updated information on possible threats.

We know testing isn’t cheap and government budgets are tight. But DEQ has spent nearly $3 million on cleanup work related to the J.H. Baxter plant. If the risk at Alton Baker Park really is low, conducting some soil testing there should cost just a fraction of that.

And it would be a small price to pay for peace of mind.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DJI_20250820113452_0008_D-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-04 14:01:49.417395

The U.S. Energy Information Administration says American electric consumption this year and in 2026 will exceed the record for usage reached last year.

Until 2024, the electric market essentially had been flat for most of this decade and at a very low point in 2020.

The demand for electricity during the first two decades existed. But consumption levels were offset by efficiency improvements and other structural changes in the economy.

Those changes included a shift away from traditional manufacturing in the United States – and other developed countries – to service industries. And those industries tend to use less power than manufacturing.

Now, the federal government is projecting growth of 1.7 percent through next year.

This forecasted upsurge is attributed primarily to commercial and industrial sector growth.

For instance, commercial growth is projected to increase by 2.6 percent, while the industrial sector should increase 2.1 percent.

Forecasts involving the residential sector are lower. Usage there will depend on weather changes. Nevertheless, residential usage still is expected to increase 0.7 percent through next year.

Much of the recent and forecasted growth, the Energy Information Administration says, comes from the commercial sector in the form of building and expanding of data centers and in the industrial sector through the expansion of manufacturing establishments.

While this is good news, one of the big remaining questions is the supply of electricity. And certainly, central to that is reliability.

The administration in Washington is making efforts to develop or rebuild American manufacturing, and here at home we are trying to develop data centers, as well as attracting more manufacturing plants.

Vast increases for demand will spur greater efforts at developing the electric grids that carry the power to various locations.

The administration’s goal is to seek energy independence for the United States.

This is an important step forward for the nation and one that will not be achieved without some strong efforts on behalf of both government and private sector companies.

The deal, which could fetch up to 2 billion reais ($374 million) according to one of the sources, has drawn interest from other bidders, they added. One of the sources noted that the asset sale, coordinated by Bank of America, is still in its early stages and J&F has not yet made a binding offer.

The negotiations are part of a wave of dealmaking in Brazil’s power sector this year, which could soon include big deals from players including Canada’s Brookfield and France’s Engie, people familiar with the matter said.

Asked about talks to sell its Norte Fluminense plant, EDF said it is weighing IPOs of its North American and Brazilian subsidiaries as part of a 10-year global plan to boost the growth of its portfolio and long-term investment capacity.

J&F and Bank of America declined to comment.

FRENCH UTILITY REFOCUSES ON DOMESTIC NUCLEAR

As part of a strategic overhaul, EDF is weighing options for its Brazilian assets while reducing its overseas presence and divesting non-core assets to refocus on domestic nuclear projects.

The natural gas-fired plant is operating without long-term contracts from buyers, making it attractive to J&F, which often seeks underperforming assets for turnaround, a source said. J&F’s power company Ambar Energia has other plants without long-term contracts in its portfolio.

J&F, which also owns meatpacker JBS , has expanded its reach in the energy sector through its subsidiary Ambar Energia.

The holding company separately made an offer this week to buy Roraima Energia, a power distribution company in the northern Brazilian state owned by the Oliveira Energia group.

Last year, J&F signed a preliminary agreement with Oliveira Energia to take control of the power distribution company in Amazonas, but the deal has yet to be finalized.",https://brazilenergyinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/edf-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 11:00:35.132633

Since the program began in 2023, it has helped take more than 2,700 gas-guzzling vehicles off the roads, according to Denver7.
In addition to the environmental and public-health benefits of EVs, electric vehicles can also save drivers thousands of dollars per year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.","With federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles having expired Sept. 30, officials in Colorado have stepped in to fill the gap by increasing state rebates for EVs, according to Denver7, a local ABC affiliate.

""The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay,"" said Jared Polis, the Colorado governor, according to Denver7. ""Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost. I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: Get out there now.""

Under the revised program, Colorado residents making up to 80% of the area's median income will be able to get a rebate of up to $9,000 for a new EV and $6,000 for a used EV when they trade in an older, gasoline-powered vehicle. These figures represent an increase from the previous rebates of $6,000 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one, Denver7 reported.

The increased rebates were aimed at continuing the forward momentum of EV sales in the state after a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs ended Sept. 30.

Even when charged off an average U.S. electrical grid, EVs are responsible for far less planet-heating pollution per mile than cars and trucks powered by internal-combustion engines.

""For light duty vehicles in the U.S., we see roughly 60 to 68% lower emissions from electric vehicles versus gas powered vehicles,"" explained Ed Piersa, an employee for the state energy office, according to Denver7.

While the existing rebate program had room in its budget to provide the higher rebates to lower-income Coloradans, there was not enough money to apply those higher figures to all Colorado residents.

""We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,"" said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, according to Denver7.

Still, officials hope that increasing the rebates for at least some Coloradans will help the state continue to make progress on replacing gas-powered vehicles with cleaner EVs.

Since the program began in 2023, it has helped take more than 2,700 gas-guzzling vehicles off the roads, according to Denver7.

In addition to being responsible for significantly less heat-trapping pollution per mile than gas-powered cars, EVs also do not emit dangerous substances like particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide during operation, according to the California Air Resources Board.

""Health effects from vehicle pollution can include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as increased risk of cancer,"" warned the Air Resources Board's website.

In addition to the environmental and public-health benefits of EVs, electric vehicles can also save drivers thousands of dollars per year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

To push the environmental, public-health, and cost-saving benefits of driving an EV even further, you can install solar panels on your home. Home solar systems can drop your electricity bill to practically zero while powering all of your electric appliances, including an EV charging station, with cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is the chair of SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project.","Families and business owners across America deserve the opportunity to grow and thrive. Yet, I keep hearing the same concern: Rising energy costs are squeezing budgets and forcing impossible choices. In Tampa just this summer, residents saw a $50 jump in their monthly electric bill due to rising temperatures and other extreme weather. They’re not alone. According to recent data, three in four Americans are concerned about utility bills rising this year, with most saying they feel powerless to do anything about it.

The facts back up the concerns. Across the country, families are watching their electricity bills rise and wondering how they can skimp on groceries and other necessities to scrape by. Small manufacturers are struggling to stay competitive as energy costs eat into their margins. Farmers watch as economic tools that would have allowed them to keep operations in their family are ripped out of their hands.

On top of all this, new federal policies are pulling us in the wrong direction. Just look at North Carolina, where the administration has ripped away federal funds from organizations that would have lowered household bills through low-cost solar.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can build a thriving and sustainable economy that empowers working people — not high-dollar political donors. And to do so, we need only look to states and communities that are already building these solutions. While we need to think big, we also have the tools we need to build a better future right in front of us.

That’s why I’m proud that we are coming together to launch SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project, a comprehensive initiative to develop real solutions for the economic challenges facing American families and businesses due to rising energy costs, increasing global economic competition and growing climate disasters.

Right here in the Sunshine State, I see proof that clean energy is key to our next economic boom. Clean investments made possible by expiring federal tax credits have attracted more than $12 billion in investment, leading to more than 12,000 new jobs. Despite headwinds, over 90% of capacity added to our nation’s grid in the past year has been clean energy that can help families save money, create jobs and meet growing demand. This is proof that when we invest in clean, reliable energy infrastructure, we create economic opportunity.

The Thriving Economy Project will focus on four key areas where we can make real progress: helping communities and rural economies flourish, securing an affordable-energy future, developing innovative financing solutions and building government systems that deliver results. This isn’t about imposing solutions from the top down. It’s about finding what’s already working in communities across America — and finding ways to scale it.

This project will spend the next year listening to communities nationwide to see what’s working and what’s not. We’ll bring together farmers and manufacturers, small business owners and labor leaders, mayors and governors, CEOs and policy experts, researchers and community activists. We’ll look at successful models from red states and blue states, rural areas and urban centers, because good ideas don’t have a party label. The goal is to develop a practical roadmap that Congress, states and local communities can use to create more jobs, lower energy costs, foster American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and build stronger, more resilient local economies.

This project is about building an economy where a small business owner doesn’t have to choose between paying her electric bill and giving her employees a raise, where a manufacturing worker in Michigan can be confident that his job will still exist in 10 years, where a farmer in Iowa can invest in new technology knowing it will pay off for his operations and his community.

American communities already are writing the playbook for 21st-century prosperity. With the Thriving Economy Project, our job is to make sure everyone has access to those tools and opportunities. The communities leading this charge have shown us what’s possible. Now it’s time to make it inevitable.

Washington’s push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, expand electric vehicles and grow a clean-energy economy faces new hurdles as the Trump administration rolls back federal climate policies — changes state officials warn could slow progress and jeopardize billions in planned investments.

Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said the federal government is “attacking the science” that underpins decades of climate action and weakening the state’s ability to meet ambitious targets. Those federal efforts include proposals to overturn the EPA’s 2009 greenhouse gas “endangerment finding,” a legal determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and cutting off tax credits and infrastructure funds for electric vehicles, solar and wind projects.

“The administration has decided that they’re going to attack the science,” Sixkiller told Austin Jenkins on TVW’s “Inside Olympia.”

“They’re going to undermine decades’ worth of established science and understanding about the way in which fossil fuels are altering our environment,” he said. “And what I continue to remind folks is, you know, you can erase the science, but you can’t erase what people are experiencing.”

Sixkiller said state-level initiatives such as the Climate Commitment Act, the creation of a joint carbon market with California and a plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars will continue. “We have no other choice but to continue to move the work forward — to decarbonize our economy and unblock the opportunity that comes with that,” he said.

The state is also responding to the end of federal EV incentives. As $7,500 rebates for electric vehicle purchases expired in September under a Trump-backed budget bill, Gov. Bob Ferguson and Ecology launched “ZEVergreen,” an initiative to explore new tools and policies to keep EV adoption on track. The program will convene utilities, automakers, community groups and industry leaders to design potential state-level incentives, especially for low-income buyers, and to accelerate EV infrastructure investments.

Critics say Washington’s climate policies raise gas prices while delivering too few environmental gains. The Seattle Times editorial board argues less than 14% of carbon auction revenue directly reduces emissions.

The Washington Policy Center, state Sen. Nikki Torres and Rep. Mary Dye sued the departments of Ecology and Commerce this month, alleging they missed a reporting deadline and failed to release 2022 and 2023 emissions data, limiting lawmakers’ and the public’s ability to assess climate progress.

Sixkiller acknowledged that regulatory costs are real but said the alternative — continued reliance on fossil fuels — is worse. “There’s also a cost to the ongoing use of petroleum, and that’s real,” he said. He added that revenue from the Climate Commitment Act is already funding heat pumps, EV access and community resilience projects.

“We can fight climate change, protect natural resources, and restore Puget Sound — and still grow the economy,” Sixkiller said. “Washington has a long history of proving those aren’t competing goals.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anacortes-refinery-2048x1013.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 09:00:11.368754

Sixkiller said state-level initiatives such as the Climate Commitment Act, the creation of a joint carbon market with California and a plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars will continue. “We have no other choice but to continue to move the work forward — to decarbonize our economy and unblock the opportunity that comes with that,” he said.

The state is also responding to the end of federal EV incentives. As $7,500 rebates for electric vehicle purchases expired in September under a Trump-backed budget bill, Gov. Bob Ferguson and Ecology launched “ZEVergreen,” an initiative to explore new tools and policies to keep EV adoption on track. The program will convene utilities, automakers, community groups and industry leaders to design potential state-level incentives, especially for low-income buyers, and to accelerate EV infrastructure investments.

Critics say Washington’s climate policies raise gas prices while delivering too few environmental gains. The Seattle Times editorial board argues less than 14% of carbon auction revenue directly reduces emissions.

The Washington Policy Center, state Sen. Nikki Torres and Rep. Mary Dye sued the departments of Ecology and Commerce this month, alleging they missed a reporting deadline and failed to release 2022 and 2023 emissions data, limiting lawmakers’ and the public’s ability to assess climate progress.

Sixkiller acknowledged that regulatory costs are real but said the alternative — continued reliance on fossil fuels — is worse. “There’s also a cost to the ongoing use of petroleum, and that’s real,” he said. He added that revenue from the Climate Commitment Act is already funding heat pumps, EV access and community resilience projects.

“We can fight climate change, protect natural resources, and restore Puget Sound — and still grow the economy,” Sixkiller said. “Washington has a long history of proving those aren’t competing goals.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47634/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anacortes-refinery-1024x5071759575926.jpg?h=f7061928&itok=liQyjSkz,N,,2025-10-04 08:04:04.265384

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody … we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she’s confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

This is the 182nd in the ‘China Chronicles’ series.

Washington’s new “foreign entity of concern” rules and CATL’s designation as a “Chinese military company” highlight how US efforts to secure EV supply chains are reshaping clean energy, industrial policy, and geopolitics.

The United States (US)–China rivalry has now moved beyond tariffs and chip bans to critical raw materials (CRMs) that power electric vehicles (EVs), grid storage, and defence industries, turning supply chains into geopolitical terrain.

At the heart of this is lithium batteries, essential for decarbonisation, energy storage, and military technologies. Among battery chemistries, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has gained prominence for its lower cost and safety, making lithium a strategic lever, rather than a mere commodity. Control over lithium refining and LFP technology will dictate how quickly and affordably the world electrifies.

Moreover, since battery-grade refining and materials determine EV costs and deployment timelines, and with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning of potential lithium tightness as electrification accelerates, the stakes are exceptionally high. Consequently, for the US, securing these supply chains is about more than industrial growth; it is about energy independence and strategic advantage.

In this context, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s leading EV battery maker with roughly 38 percent market share, now stands squarely in this crossfire. The Pentagon recently labelled CATL a “Chinese military company”, underscoring how geopolitics is reshaping clean-energy supply chains as Washington walls off sensitive links while sustaining EV momentum. This brief, therefore, examines CATL’s designation and its implications for the company’s US expansion.

US Dependence on Chinese Minerals

China dominates the midstream refining and processing, where prices, quality, and timelines are set, giving it leverage over the US. In batteries, China controls roughly 70–95 percent of global lithium, cobalt, phosphate, and graphite processing capacity, directly shaping availability and costs for battery-grade materials. This includes nearly 80 percent of LFP, two-thirds of nickel-based cathodes, and over 90 percent of graphite anodes, creating single-point sensitivity that turns policy shifts into project delays.

In contrast, the US has limited domestic refining, leaving it heavily reliant on imported battery-grade lithium, graphite, and other critical inputs. To address this, new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules aim to reduce strategic exposure to Chinese supply chains.

Rare earths follow a similar pattern, with most refining concentrated in China, reinforcing systemic dependence across motors and advanced electronics. In contrast, the US has limited domestic refining, leaving it heavily reliant on imported battery-grade lithium, graphite, and other critical inputs. To address this, new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules aim to reduce strategic exposure to Chinese supply chains.

China has also begun using its dominance as leverage. Recent export licensing requirements on rare earths signalled Beijing’s willingness to weaponise minerals, turning EV supply chains from an industrial challenge into a national security concern.

The tables below outline China’s recent policy actions and the extent of US dependence on these CRMs.

CATL’s Position and US Listing

CATL has expanded rapidly across Europe and Asia, supplying major automakers and building large-scale projects in Germany, Hungary, and Indonesia to diversify its market base.

The US Department of Defense (now renamed the Department of War) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” citing concerns over China’s military-civil fusion strategy. CATL dismissed the designation as “mistaken” and politically motivated.

However, on 7 January 2025, the US Department of Defense (now renamed the Department of War) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” citing concerns over China’s military-civil fusion strategy. CATL dismissed the designation as “mistaken” and politically motivated.

While the label does not impose a flat ban, it acts as a strong deterrent. It limits defence procurement, triggers heightened scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and discourages US automakers from deepening partnerships. Political backlash is already visible, as Virginia withdrew support for a planned Ford–CATL battery plant in 2023 after national-security concerns mounted, signalling the headwinds CATL faces in the US.

Impact on US Market Entry

The designation has made direct ownership of US facilities politically untenable. CATL is now limited to arm’s-length licensing deals, such as the Ford Michigan LFP plant, where Ford owns the facility while CATL supplies the technology, equipment, and know-how. This structure avoids triggering FEOC rules and preserves tax credit eligibility by keeping governance and supply chains separated.

However, these arrangements still face high compliance checks, political pushback, and constant reputational scrutiny, which slows timelines and raises costs. Consequently, CATL is likely to prioritise Europe, Southeast Asia, or even Canada and South America for new capacity, supplying the US indirectly while sidestepping its volatile regulatory environment.

CATL is now limited to arm’s-length licensing deals, such as the Ford Michigan LFP plant, where Ford owns the facility while CATL supplies the technology, equipment, and know-how.

FEOC Rule as the Choke Point

FEOC status is triggered when a covered nation holds 25 percent or more of board seats, voting rights, equity, or effective control through licenses or contracts. These rules form the strongest barrier to Chinese involvement in US clean energy supply chains.

Starting in 2024, EV tax credits are denied for vehicles containing battery components from Chinese-controlled entities. In 2025, the restriction expands to critical minerals such as lithium and graphite.

For US automakers, this means proving that no part of their supply chain is under FEOC control to claim tax credits and pass Department of Energy and Internal Revenue Service review, a daunting task given China’s dominance in midstream processing.

Licensing models like Ford’s can technically proceed: they must be governed by strict legal and operational separation, making every CATL-linked project costly, complex, and politically sensitive.

Strategic Path Forward

CATL’s listing does not ban the company outright, but limits it to indirect engagement rather than direct ownership of US plants. Its strategy now centres on licensing technology and manufacturing intellectual property (IP), expanding in lower-risk regions like Europe and Southeast Asia, and tightening control over upstream lithium and graphite supplies to maintain pricing power.

The US strategy, in turn, hinges on scaling domestic refining to reduce dependence on Chinese inputs and building friend-shored supply chains with allies like Canada and Australia. FEOC rules remain central to enforcing clean governance separation while keeping EVs affordable.

Without rapid midstream development in North America, these policies will slow China’s influence but fall short of delivering true supply chain independence.

At the time, the Carbon Capture Coalition called this a “major step backward” and argued that withdrawing support undermines certainty for businesses.

Hydrogen hubs, direct air capture megaprojects and grid resilience programmes are among the 223 projects affected, with several awardees already weighing appeals.

Trade groups and state leaders say the decision risks undermining investment confidence just as electricity demand surges from data centres and artificial intelligence.

“Pulling back promised funding jeopardises jobs and local investment while weakening American competitiveness,” said Ben Rubin, Executive Director of the Carbon Business Council.

Environmental advocacy group the Natural Resources Defense Council described the cancellations as a blow to innovation and consumer costs, while governors in California and Washington condemned the move as partisan.

What does the DOE say?

The administration defended the move on the grounds of fiscal discipline.

The decision was first announced on Wednesday by Russ Vought, Director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, who called the grants “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in a post on X.

DOE Secretary Chris Wright justified the cuts by arguing that “many [were] rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation delivers on that commitment.”

Who is impacted by the cuts?

According to Politico’s E&E News, the cuts impact two major hydrogen hub projects led by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, nearly half of the direct air capture (DAC) hub grants, and other smaller projects.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association – a coalition of public and private groups in Washington, Oregon, and Montana – will have its $1bn funding cut. Similarly, the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California will not receive $1.2bn previously earmarked for the project.

“While we are disappointed in the DOE’s decision to cut funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub there is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started – establishing a national benchmark for hydrogen production that brings economic opportunities to communities across the region,” the association said.

At least 10 of 21 planned DAC megaprojects are understood to be affected, while other companies including Plug Power and GE Vernova also appear on the list of cancelled awards. Neither company has yet issued a public response.

The cuts also include 26 grants under the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships programme, which is aimed at boosting the resilience of the electric grid.

Political reaction and next steps

The political response has been angry in places. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson said, “It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington.”

California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” while Senator Patty Murray described the cancellations as a “blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

No award figures or project details for the cancellation have yet been made available. However, the cuts almost exclusively impact states run by Democrats.

It is the second major round of clean energy project cancellations in the Trump administration. In May, the DOE announced it would cancel 24 projects, many of them carbon capture-related. At the time, the Carbon Capture Coalition called this a “major step backward” and argued that withdrawing support undermines certainty for businesses.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision and some of the projects included in the announcement have already begun that process.

There could even be legal implications. According to the Colorado Energy Office, it had not yet received official notification despite being named on the cancellation list – a sign of the confusion surrounding the process.

With lawsuits likely from states and developers holding signed agreements, the fate of many projects remains uncertain. For now, the cancellations deepen questions over whether the US can provide the policy stability needed to sustain investment in hydrogen, carbon capture and other clean energy technologies over the next few years in particular.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/shutterstock_1418358686.jpg",N,,2025-10-04 08:03:36.342765

By contrast, solar farms and wind turbines are scattered, which makes them harder to hit, and relatively simple to fix.
“New fossil fuel infrastructure is very vulnerable now—it’s just a waste of money.
These industry groups share a history of opposing climate policy in California, including the state’s climate plan, climate disclosure laws, and transport regulations.
“For over 50 years, the U.S. government has knowingly endangered our lives by driving the fossil fuel system that is destroying our climate.","As I write this, the Orsknefteorgsintez refinery in Orsk, Russia is ablaze. It sits 1,400 kilometers from the border with Ukraine—in fact, along the border with Kazakhstan. The refinery has a capacity of 6.6 million tons of oil yearly, and among other things it’s one of two refineries capable of producing the jet fuel used by the country’s strategic bombers.

The best reason for nations to switch to power from the sun and wind is that it will reduce, by some degree, the severity of the climate crisis (and save millions of lives lost each year to pollution). The second best reason is that it’s cheaper than fossil fuel, and any nation who doesn’t shift will be stuck with an economy running on expensive energy. But it seems to me—not a military analyst, but a fairly good tea-leaves reader—that the war in Ukraine may be adding a third to the list: its comparative invulnerability to attack.

As the world has begun to figure out, something important has happened amidst the carnage of Russia’s immoral invasion: warfare has changed forever, with the small drone quickly replacing much of the military hardware we grew accustomed to in the 20th century. Drones have been ubiquitous along the front lines, where the no-man’s zone between the armies is lethally patrolled by squadrons of drones able to take out tanks, troop transports, and pretty much anything else—that explains much of the stasis of the last two years; the competing forces are largely pinned down.

The Russians, of course, have also been using drones to attack civilian assets—every night a new sortie, mixed in with missiles, seems to take out kindergartens, hospitals, and old folks homes. An early target was Ukraine’s energy sources, in an effort to freeze the fight out of the nation. (Currently the Russians seem to be playing dangerous games with the offline nuclear power plants not far from the front lines). But as we head into yet another war of winter, Ukraine hangs on—and more than hangs on.

Over the course of the war, by sheer necessity, Ukraine has developed a formidable drone industry, and increasingly it is using them against a singular set of targets: the oil refining and transport infrastructure spread out across its sprawling foe. Russia has formidable air defenses, of course—Ukraine couldn’t fly a bomber across 1,400 kilometers of the country’s airspace to bomb a refinery. But the small and comparatively slow drones have proved equal to the task. As the FT reported last week,

Sixteen of Russia’s 38 refineries have been hit since the start of August, some of them multiple times, including one of Russia’s largest fuel-processing facilities, the 340,000 barrel-a-day plant at Ryazan, close to Moscow.

The strikes have disrupted more than 1 million barrels a day of Russia’s refining capacity, according to Energy Aspects, a research group. Diesel exports, if they maintain the current rate, will fall to the lowest monthly total in September since 2020, according to both OilX and Vortexa, which track cargoes.

“It seems to be the most effective campaign that Ukraine has carried out so far,” said Benedict George, head of European petroleum products pricing at Argus, which reports commodity prices.

It’s not just export cargoes that are affected. Russia itself—one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers—has begun to run short of gasoline for its own motorists. According to Victoria Veselova, in Crimea, for instance, drivers are

experiencing an unprecedented fuel crisis. Local gas stations have run out of gasoline. Local Russian authorities admit that the reason for this is a decline in oil refining volumes in Russia. This was caused by regular drone attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian oil refineries. Crimea.Realities explains how Crimeans are coping without fuel and what to expect.

The first fuel problems in Crimea appeared in mid-August. The popular AI-95 gasoline disappeared from local gas stations. The price of gasoline of all grades also rose sharply. Many Crimean drivers switched to cheaper AI-92 gasoline, damaging their cars.

The Russian head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, promised that the situation would improve by the end of September, when the rush associated with the holiday season had subsided. However, by that time, the problem had not only persisted but had worsened: in September, fuel completely disappeared from Crimean gas stations.

It’s also affecting the mobility of the Russian military, according to reporting in the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Sept. 25 that Kyiv’s strikes on Russia’s oil sector have severely disrupted fuel supplies and logistics for Moscow’s armed forces.

“This is a fuel crisis in Russia, which directly affects logistics and the supply of its army,” Syrskyi said at a meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent.

The general lesson to be drawn from this, it seems to me, is that centralized and complex energy facilities are now sitting ducks for drone attack, and that that will certainly alter military calculations going forward. A refinery, for instance, is one of the most complicated machines humanity has ever constructed, often covering hundreds of acres. It’s filled with highly complex equipment and highly flammable hydrocarbons; hit one corner with a drone and the flames and the damage are likely to spread quickly. Not far behind—as Ukraine has learned to its sadness—are coal and gas-fired power plants—expensive infrastructure that can take months or years to rebuild as your citizens shiver.

By contrast, solar farms and wind turbines are scattered, which makes them harder to hit, and relatively simple to fix. Silicon doesn’t explode when it’s hit: a drone may take out some panels, but they are easy to switch out for new ones. And individual rooftop installations are too small to be systematically attacked. That’s why there’s been a huge boom in small-scale solar across Ukraine. As Michael Shank and Konstantyn Krynytskyi reported in Fast Company earlier this summer

Communities across Ukraine are becoming energy secure and energy independent: adding solar power stations to schools, hospitals, and homes; backing up that solar with battery storage capacity; and switching to more energy efficient heating and cooling with heat pumps and insulation. This is happening across Ukraine in response to the war and the years of large-scale attacks on power grids and energy infrastructure, which Russia continues to this day.

Cities and communities across Ukraine—from Kyiv and Horenka to Rivne and Zviahel to Lviv and Sheptytskyi—are scaling up this energy-secure trifecta wherever possible. And it’s paying off both in energy independence and economic savings; in many cases, these critical upgrades are cutting annual energy bills in half or more.

Hospitals have become the natural first stop for these kinds of upgrades since attacks to power grids and resulting blackouts jeopardize medical safety and medical procedures. The advanced Unbroken medical facility in Lviv, for example, which treats many of the veterans and victims of the war, is rapidly covering its many roofs with solar power and filling its basements with batteries so that its patients are protected from further energy insecurity and instability during surgery or recovery processes.

School facilities have become a second stop for upgrades since their energy footprint is both substantial and switchable—meaning there’s usually ample roof space for a quick solar retrofit. Since schools also come with a sizable building footprint, they’re often utilized as bomb shelters for the community, which makes the energy secure retrofit even more essential and life-saving.

Multifamily housing units—e.g., homeowners associations (HOAs) in bigger cities like Kyiv and dormitories in cities like Zviahel for internally displaced persons from the war—have also become easy retrofits, transforming roofs into solar stations, backyards into heat pump housing, and basements into battery storage facilities.

These HOA retrofits have been so successful at the local level, the national association of homeowners may soon become the organizing mechanism for more of these whole-system energy security retrofits, coordinating a national campaign across the country.

As it happens, I got to spend some time this week with Svitlana Romanko, a dear friend and colleague. Before the war began she was a stalwart of the global climate movement, deeply engaged with the Laudato Si movement (that’s why we were together in Rome for the meetings with the pope I described a few days ago). But when her country was attacked she became one of its fiercest defenders, mobilizing international campaigns to cut off Russia’s oil and gas exports and at home working to insure that a postwar Ukraine will be rebuilt as a green energy power. Her Razom We Stand nonprofit has been indomitable and incorruptible—they joined in the campaign to limit American LNG exports as well as Russian.

Anyway, Romanko and I sat in a noisy Italian cafeteria yesterday and talked through the possibilities. She says the Ukrainian government has been lagging behind civil society and small scale enterprises in building out renewables, but that city governments are starting to fill the gap.

“New fossil fuel infrastructure is very vulnerable now—it’s just a waste of money. By contrast, it’s very hard to destroy these small power plants and the energy they provide is cheap.” But she had another point to make: there are tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are suddenly engaged producing drones for the country’s war effort. That means they are quickly becoming skilled at working with electric motors, cooling fans, wiring—all the things necessary to deploy clean energy, heat pumps, and the like in the aftermath of the war. “The technology we’ve been able to develop will definitely be transitioned to renewable energy. If we could make one dream right now, what we would like to see happening—we need some jobs. And these are the people skills that are becoming available. And the role of women will be crucial—they’ve started learning the skills that they’ve never had before. And our veterans who will come home, hopefully with a win from the battlefield, they will have to repurpose. In Ukraine, the war eliminated 6.5 million jobs, but now we will be able to 4.5 million green jobs can be easily created—in electricity, water supply, education and skills-gaining, and construction. This is all in our hands. But first we need to defeat Putin.”

Romanko has never wavered from her pre-war convictions: “Morally it’s not acceptable for us to receive energy from the dirty forms of power,” she said. But now she and her fellow Ukrainians have added a new argument to the fight for clean energy around the world, one that may move people with a less-developed ethical code.

+A new study finds that even modest rises in sea level will endanger tens of millions of homes across the global south

Previous research has estimated that 0.7–0.9 m global mean SLR is likely to occur by 2100, and 2.2–2.5 m by 2300, if the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met24. This magnitude of LSLR across coastlines in the study area alone would inundate on the order of 5 million existing buildings at high tide by the end of this century

+In a follow up to my last dispatch, happy to report that MAGA was melting down over Pope Leo’s endorsement of Laudato Si and the climate fight

Matt Walsh - who describes himself as a “theocratic fascist” on his X profile with 3.2 million followers - said, “The leader of the Catholic Church shouldn’t be anywhere near this nonsense.”

He accused the Pope of joining “communist hippy freaks in some kind of weird pagan Earth-worshipping hippy ritual.” In this case, the communist hippy freaks included…GOP California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

+The ever-vigilant Antonia Juhasz has an excellent report on the machinations behind the plan to build a big new LNG pipeline in Alaska

Trump has set his sights on Alaska as a test case for his disastrous “National Energy Dominance” agenda. He wants to double oil production in the state, open up vast new tracts of land to exploitation, kneecap renewable energy, and push construction of what would be one of the largest and most expensive fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the nation. The project includes a massive 800-mile-long gas pipeline stretching from one end of Alaska to the other and a mammoth new export facility to ship gas out of the U.S. to Asia, with an estimated total price tag of over $70 billion.

Last month, I met people across Alaska organizing to resist Trump’s plans. They are pushing back against an agenda they see as catastrophically harmful to their pocketbooks, their way of life, and even their existence. They characterize Trump’s fossil-fueled ambitions as more of a retrograde political ploy than a genuine effort to benefit the state or the nation. Organizing against Trump’s energy agenda has strengthened ties between people often viewed as political adversaries, they explain, providing a sense of community and purpose despite the president’s best efforts to divide the nation.

“No one is throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Well, he’s won,’” Elisabeth Dabney, longtime executive director of the Northern Center in Fairbanks, tells me. “There is hope in being an Alaskan in this moment and seeing that there is solidarity, there is gumption to not give up, and there is strategy. It’s very powerful.”

+California is considering whether to adopt a “Climate Supefund” bill like the ones passed in Vermont and New York that would charge the oil giants for climate damage. The folks at Influence Map have an incisive account of who’s paying to oppose the bill

The California Chamber of Commerce (CalChamber), American Chemistry Council, American Forest & Paper Association, and Western States Petroleum Association officially registered in opposition to the California Climate Superfund bill (see testimony from CalChamber), with American Petroleum Institute (API) criticizing the bill in an April 2025 press release. These industry groups share a history of opposing climate policy in California, including the state’s climate plan, climate disclosure laws, and transport regulations. CalChamber describes itself as “the largest broad-based business advocate to government in California,” with representatives from Walt Disney Company, Ernst & Young, and others serving on its Executive Committee. The group’s highly diverse membership base and leadership circle make its fossil fuel-friendly advocacy questionable in a state where many businesses have ambitious climate goals.

InfluenceMap research shows that CalChamber is using narratives previously employed by the US Chamber of Commerce (US Chamber) and API, suggesting a strategic effort that may be spearheaded by the national associations to oppose state Climate Superfund bills nationwide. Since at least February 2024, API, the US Chamber, and other state chambers of commerce have been repeating misleading claims around the legality, emissions attribution, and economic impact of Climate Superfund programs in states such as Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York.

+Even appliance makers think the Trump administration is going overboard in trying to cut efficiency standards for things like refrigerators

David Doniger, senior strategist for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an interview that the move amounted to a favor to a handful of supermarkets resistant to the Biden administration rule.

“It is bad for the climate. And bad for the rest of the industry,” Doniger said. “It won’t change grocery prices one penny.”

+The no-longer-quite-so-young activists who sued the U.S. government for climate action in Juliana V. U.S. may have eventually lost that case in federal court—but now they’re taking their effort to an international tribunal

The nonprofit law firm, Our Children’s Trust, and 15 of the original 21 plaintiffs in the case Juliana et al. v. United States filed a petition Sept. 23 with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that accuses the United States government of violating international law through its perpetuation of a fossil fuel-based energy system and requests an investigation.

“For over 50 years, the U.S. government has knowingly endangered our lives by driving the fossil fuel system that is destroying our climate. This is not neglect — it is deliberate harm,” said petitioner Levi Draheim, now 18, in a release provided by Our Children’s Trust. “The government’s long-standing actions have violated our rights to life, health, and dignity, and young people like me are paying the price.”

The petition comes after a pair of historic advisory opinions on climate change issued in July by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights and the International Court of Justice, and a similarly groundbreaking climate opinion from the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2024 that recognize climate change as an “existential” threat to humanity and ecosystems.

+The Labour government of Keir Starmer in the UK has been having its share of troubles lately—among other things, it somehow boxed itself into arresting any activist who held up a sign with the words Palestine Action, which, um, encouraged a large number of people to do just that. But one place where it’s been doing good work is in energy, under the leadership of Ed Milliband. He seems unimpressed by Trump’s call for the Brits to abandon windpower

In response, Miliband said countries were entitled to act in their own interests, and that for many outside the U.S., targeting climate goals can lead to cheaper and more secure energy.

“There’s lots of talk about countries stepping back from climate action and clean energy, but my message is, don’t believe the doomsters,” he said by videolink.

“When you look at what’s really happening, it’s actually a very, very different story.”

As well as citing a more upbeat-than-expected vibe at Climate Week events, he pointed to data showing clean energy technologies attracted over $2 trillion in investment in 2024 - twice the amount in fossil fuels.

+Also in the lead up to global climate talks next month in Belem, Brazil, the “climate-vulnerable” nations renewed a call for more financing for adaptation

In particular, CVF-V20 ministers and heads of government, meeting on the sidelines of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 80) in New York, committed to work hard for a comprehensive Adaptation Package at COP30—anchored in prosperity, affordable long-term finance, technology access, and strengthened national institutions—to close the adaptation gap and secure a resilient future for the most climate-exposed nations.

Leaders noted that the world was above 1.5°C for all of 2024, and stressed that the climate crisis is a driver of structural and systemic macroeconomic and financial instability. Specifically, climate change shocks are compounded by inflexible debt and high servicing costs, which drain fiscal space and constrain the ambition and ability of many nations to invest in the adaptation and resilience urgently needed to protect their people and economies.

The CVF-V20 calls for urgent steps to strengthen delivery, expand access to affordable, long-term finance for adaptation, resilience and economic transformation. Leaders emphasised that multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) must scale up concessional lending to rates below countries’ medium-term GDP growth rates.

“With the world having passed 1.5 degrees and the imminent threat this poses to our countries, we must now mobilise the adaptation finance needed to tackle the hurricane of climate damages that will follow. We must reshape a global financial system that is too slow, delivers too little, and burdens the next generation with the cost of today’s delays. It is not enough to pledge more finance or declare new commitments. What matters is scale, acceleration and delivery,” H.E. Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados and Chair of the Barbados CVF-V20 Presidency, emphasised during the meeting.

It will be interesting to see how proposals like this fare with the US removing itself from climate talks. The key question: will China step up? A first indication: China did commit itself for the first time to specific cuts in carbon emissions, but the target it laid out at the UN was fairly timid. China—unlike the US—has a long history of under-promising and over-delivering, but that coyness may not serve it or the world so well as the vacuum of U.S. leadership beings to open

+Aaron Gell in the New Republic has an epic piece describing how the American insurance industry has been wrecked by climate change, and a consultant-driven effort to avoid actually paying out to co]ustomers facing damage. It’s an ugly story, beautifully told

A decidedly unglamorous business that mostly draws attention when it fails, property and casualty insurance, or P&C, has for decades quietly powered the economy and bolstered the American picket-fence dream. “Insurers are the foundational layer for most homeownership,” Abrahm Lustgarten, author of On the Move: The Overheating Earth and the Uprooting of America, told me, “and thus for most American middle-class wealth.”

In recent years, however, the insurance industry has begun to look notably shaky, staggering from one crisis to the next on its way to what some observers say could become a meltdown. As extreme weather events—an apocalyptic laundry list including but not limited to floods, windstorms, hailstorms, wildfires, droughts, mudslides, and heat waves—grow more frequent and intense due to the heedless destabilization of the climate, premiums are rising, payouts are shrinking, and, increasingly, carriers are bailing on markets deemed too risky. Millions of policyholders received nonrenewal notices in recent years, and many are now taking their chances without any protection.

“I don’t think we’re in imminent risk of the whole system collapsing tomorrow,” said Carolyn Kousky, the acting chief economist at Environmental Defense Fund and founder of the nonprofit Insurance for Good, “but risk is growing dramatically year on year, and we have not done any of the necessary decarbonization to stabilize that increasing risk.” As Whitehouse put it in a recent interview, “There’s no Band-Aid big enough to paper this over if you don’t deal with the fundamental underlying danger.”

+China has tested the first “airship” floating wind turbine designed to capture the fast-blowing breezes at high altitudes. And…the test was successful

The system passed strict tests, including full desert assembly and repeated deployments in high winds. This marks a major milestone for airborne wind power.

The S1500 is a megawatt-scale commercial system that floats in the sky like a giant Zeppelin. Measuring approximately 197 feet long (60 meters), 131 feet wide (40 meters), and 131 feet tall (40 meters), it is by far the largest airborne wind-power generator ever built, according to Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Co., Ltd., one of the developers.

The S1500 features a main airfoil and an annular wing that together form a giant duct. Inside this duct are 12 turbine-generator sets, each rated at 100 kW. These rotors capture steady high-altitude winds and convert them into electricity. The power is transmitted to the ground via a tether cable.

In California, that could be felt in ...","Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/trump-slashed-8-billion-for-energy-projects-in-blue-states-in-california-red-areas-will-feel-the-pain,"It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects.
The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money.
Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week.
About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker.
“The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,” the senators said.","The Trump administration this week escalated its efforts against renewable energy when it announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, including California.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the 223 canceled projects — all of which are in states that favored Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election — were terminated because they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But while the cuts took aim at blue states, they will affect Trump’s base as well: The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans. In California, that includes large swaths of the Central Valley and Inland Empire, which largely leaned toward Trump in 2024.

Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and a top Trump administration official, said in a post on X that the canceled projects were using “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

The biggest cut was $1.2 billion for California’s ambitious project to develop clean hydrogen known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects. The idea is that the hydrogen, which burns at a very high temperature, will be able to replace planet-warming fossil fuels in some industry and transportation uses.

The ARCHES project is a public-private partnership that would create at least 10 hydrogen production sites around the state, primarily in the Central Valley. It would also help transition two large gas-fired power plants — Scattergood in Los Angeles and the Lodi Energy Center in San Joaquin County — to 100% renewable hydrogen, and develop more than 60 hydrogen fueling stations in areas including Fresno, Riverside, Orange and San Joaquin counties.

In all, it would deliver an estimated 220,000 jobs, including 130,000 construction jobs and 90,000 permanent jobs, according to the state. California is pursuing hydrogen in addition to renewables such as offshore wind, solar power and geothermal energy to help diversify its supply, meet growing demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers, and reach its target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2045.

The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money.

One district with a project that’s been cut is the northern San Joaquin Valley, represented by Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). McClintock said he strongly supports the Energy Department’s decision.

“$7.5 billion comes out to about $60 taken from the average earnings of every family in America,” McClintock said. “Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money that families have earned.”

The Times also reached out to Reps. Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), Keven Kiley (R-Rocklin), Ken Calvert (R-Corona), Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) and Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake), whose districts are touched by the ARCHES hub and other terminated projects.

A representative for Fong said his office was dealing with issues related to the U.S. government shutdown and so was unable to comment. None of the others responded.

Jesse Lee, senior advisor with the nonprofit group Climate Power, said the cancellations may not save taxpayers money, but cost them. The administration this year has canceled a $7 billion program to help low-income households install solar panels on their homes and halted the development of off-shore wind projects, among other efforts.

“Having these projects come to fruition is really the only chance we have at insulating people from skyrocketing utility bills year after year,” Lee said — particularly in the face of energy-thirsty AI. “The only way to have a prayer of meeting that demand is through these kinds of clean energy projects.”

Lee believes the actions could come back to haunt the party in the midterm elections. Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week. About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker.

Democratic officials in California said the Energy Department’s latest cuts amount to political retaliation. They were announced on the first day of the shutdown, which the administration blames on Democrats.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof that this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla wrote in a joint letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright dated Thursday, in which they urged him to restore its funding.

“The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,” the senators said. “The ARCHES hub is a key strategic investment into American energy dominance, energy technology prominence, manufacturing job growth, and lowering energy costs for American families.”

The cuts come as the Trump administrations eases the path for production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, including this week’s announcement that it will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired power plants. Coal has become increasingly uncompetitive with either natural gas or solar power.

Large-scale renewable energy and carbon capture projects in red states such as Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota that received funding from the Energy Department were not subject to the cuts.

Other canceled awards in California include $630 million to the California Energy Commission for grid resilience upgrades; $500 million to the National Cement Company of California for a carbon-neutral cement production facility; $87 million to Redwood Coast Energy Authority for grid updates benefiting tribal communities; $50 million to Southern California Edison for a battery energy storage project; and $18 million to the Imperial Irrigation District to modernize its electrical grid, bolster resiliency against power outages and catalyze renewable energy usage.

“We are disappointed as we did a great deal of work to win the $18.3 million matching grant from the DOE to help modernize our electrical grid and enhance reliability for our customers,” said Robert Schettler, a spokesman for the Imperial Irrigation District located in southeastern California. “Despite this setback, we will reevaluate the scope as the project is a necessity.”

Officials with ARCHES called the administration’s decision a “short-sighted move that abandons America’s opportunity to lead the global clean energy transition.” They said they hope to keep the project moving forward even without the federal grant; ARCHES has also secured more than $10 billion in private funding agreements.

“Despite the loss of federal funding, we will press forward with our state, private, and international partners to build the infrastructure, train the workforce, and establish the supply chains that will power a modern, resilient energy economy,” ARCHES board chair Theresa Maldonado said in a statement.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/decbbf4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6650x3491+0+472/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5a%2F94%2F438b559947cb9d796c6b76f2aca9%2F931301-fi-scattergood-generating-station-tour-jlc-0317-19476.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 06:58:48.061430

These renewable energy technologies are less expensive than natural gas and far less expensive than coal and nuclear.
As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S.
You might ask, why is our government attacking renewable energy subsidies and boosting subsidies for fossil fuels?
He is also co-chair of the Sanibel-Captiva Renewable Energy Working Group and vice president of the Committee of the Islands.","Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are now the most cost-effective forms of new electricity generation.

In 2024, solar, wind, and batteries accounted for 93% of all new electricity added to the grid.

Investments in renewable energy technologies create three times more jobs than investments in fossil fuels.

Solar power combined with battery storage can provide energy resilience during power outages caused by extreme weather.

This past Sunday, Sept. 21, was designated as Sun Day, a day where solar advocates around the country gathered to promote “the clean energy revolution.”

For the majority of Americans who are concerned about the impacts of climate change, solar and other forms of renewable energy hold significant promise. They can help to shift the ways we power our homes and economy to become more sustainable. That’s important for those of us who are seeing those impacts increasingly threaten our homes and property through stronger storms, flooding, sea level rise, dangerous heat days, longer fire seasons, health risks from particulate matter pollution and microplastics, etc.

But even for those who believe the science about climate change’s impacts is overstated, there are good reasons to be excited about the advances in renewable energy technologies. Over the past decade, the cost of clean energy has plummeted. Today, the cheapest forms of electricity going onto the grid are solar, wind and batteries. These renewable energy technologies are less expensive than natural gas and far less expensive than coal and nuclear.

In Lazard’s 2025 Levelized Cost of Energy report, a widely cited, annual analysis that provides insights into the cost competitiveness of various energy generation technologies, found that: “Despite headwinds and macroeconomic challenges, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of new-build generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S. This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

In addition to being cheaper, investments in renewable energy technologies generate three times more jobs than those targeting fossil fuels. It is no surprise that those favorable economics are driving a renaissance in clean energy development.

According to an analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 93% of all new electricity coming onto the grid in 2024 was from solar, wind and batteries. And, despite our government’s irrational opposition, that trend is expected to continue through 2030 based on the projects that developers have planned to complete in that time.

Solar, wind and batteries also have the advantage of not adding to the costs associated with climate change. According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, extreme weather costs in the U.S. exceeded $1.2 trillion in just the 10 years from 2015-2024 in inflation adjusted dollars. Further, an analysis from the re-insurance company, Swiss Re, shows that price tag could rise to $38 trillion dollars annually on a global basis in the next 30 years if no mitigating action is taken. That equates to 18% of the projected global GDP.

You might ask, why is our government attacking renewable energy subsidies and boosting subsidies for fossil fuels? Based on the economic data and the science behind climate change, you would think that a conservative administration that is looking to save money for the American people would be doing the opposite. As an electorate, we should be pointing that out.

For those of us living on a barrier island, solar and battery back-up also have tremendous resilience advantages. After Hurricane Ian left us without power for six weeks in 2022, we added battery back-up to our rooftop solar. During the four-day power outage following Hurricane Milton last summer and the many shorter outages since, we have enjoyed full power, including AC to protect against mold damage.

We also power our electric vehicle from our rooftop solar, saving money and emissions. With solar and batteries, we don’t have to be concerned about accessing fuel for a generator to power our home, which is a comfort considering the damage to the Sanibel causeway and to many propane tanks during Hurricane Ian.

In a community survey conducted last spring by the coalition group SanCap Resilience, nearly two-thirds of Sanibel and Captiva respondents stated they would like to see the islands become a model of sustainability with respect to mitigating the future impacts of climate change. On the heels of this Sun Day, there are great reasons for this community to go all in on solar and other forms of clean energy.

Bob Moore is a retired senior vice president of a Boston-based health care company who lives on Sanibel. He currently serves as a chair of SanCap Resilience, a coalition of groups formed in response to the devastating effects of Hurricane Ian on the Sanibel and Captiva communities. He is also co-chair of the Sanibel-Captiva Renewable Energy Working Group and vice president of the Committee of the Islands.

In the race to dominate artificial intelligence, Meta Platforms Inc. is making unprecedented bets on physical infrastructure, announcing plans for what could be its largest data center yet in rural Louisiana. The facility, sprawling across an area equivalent to 70 football fields, underscores the company’s aggressive pivot toward AI, even as it grapples with environmental and community concerns. According to a report from People, Meta promises 500 new jobs and a commitment to sustainability, but residents near similar projects express fears over water quality and resource strain.

This Louisiana project fits into Meta’s broader strategy, which includes massive capital expenditures projected to reach $64 billion to $72 billion in 2025 alone. As detailed in coverage by The New York Times, much of this investment fuels data center expansions essential for powering AI models like Llama. The scale is staggering: one proposed site could rival the size of Manhattan, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed in announcements covered by The Guardian.

Powering the AI Boom: Gigawatt-Scale Demands

The energy requirements for these centers are equally monumental, with Meta eyeing facilities that could consume up to 5 gigawatts—enough to power millions of homes. Posts on X highlight the exponential growth in AI data center power needs, with estimates suggesting U.S. demand could surge 30-fold by 2035. This aligns with Zuckerberg’s vision, as reported in TechCrunch, where he outlined building out infrastructure to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.

Such ambitions come amid a global scramble for energy resources. Reuters noted Meta’s discussions for a $200 billion AI data center project, per Reuters, signaling potential costs that dwarf previous tech investments. Industry insiders point to innovations in custom AI chips, with Meta’s recent acquisition of startup Rivos bolstering in-house silicon development, as covered in market analyses from Financial Content.

Sustainability Challenges and Community Impact

Yet, these developments raise red flags on sustainability. A September 2025 report from PPC Land details Meta’s environmental goals clashing with gigawatt-scale energy consumption, per PPC Land. Residents in Georgia, near a comparable Meta facility, report contaminated water supplies, echoing concerns in the Louisiana build as per the People article.

Meta counters with pledges for renewable energy integration, but the sheer scale—such as the New Albany, Ohio, expansion aiming for the world’s first gigawatt data center, as reported by The Columbus Dispatch—tests these commitments. X users, including analysts like those from SemiAnalysis, discuss temporary setups like tent-based clusters housing 500,000 GPUs and over 1,000 megawatts of power, highlighting the urgency and improvisation in Meta’s rollout.

Broader Industry Implications and Future Outlook

The push reflects a wider trend where AI infrastructure becomes the new battleground, with data centers projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2030, as noted in X posts citing energy forecasts. BBC coverage emphasizes Zuckerberg’s plans for sites nearly Manhattan-sized, per BBC, while Technology Magazine details Meta’s aim for 1.3 million Nvidia GPUs in a $65 billion investment, according to Technology Magazine.

For industry players, this signals a shift from chip shortages to power constraints, as Nvidia’s CEO has implied in recent statements echoed on X.

What happens when tax credits go away?,Caitlin Tan,,,,,https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/03/wyoming-solar-installation-firm-braces-for-end-of-tax-credits,"And then when we're working and it's December, clearing snow off roofs in two degrees, zero degrees,” Weatherford said.
“To connect the power that's produced from the solar panels to the building,” he said.
“We like to think of it as the epicenter of solar energy for the state of Wyoming,” Kane said.
The federal tax credit for residential rooftop solar was beefed up under the Biden administration, driving more business to Kane.
The original solar tax credit was supposed to taper down after just a couple years.","On top of a courthouse in eastern Wyoming one can see mountains in the distance, but on the roof are several rows of glistening black solar panels.

“So, they're angled a little bit so they can get the best production. It's facing due south,” said solar electrician Andrew Weatherford, who recently installed the arrays.

Weatherford loves an adventure, so climbing up on Wyoming roofs year-round is a good fit.

“We're doing this when it's 100 degrees in the summertime. And then when we're working and it's December, clearing snow off roofs in two degrees, zero degrees,” Weatherford said.

He unspooled electric cords that will run from the roof to a control box about 60 feet below.

“To connect the power that's produced from the solar panels to the building,” he said.

Weatherford works for a company called Creative Energies, one of the few rooftop solar installation companies in Wyoming. And they are bracing for what business will look like in the new year.

Since 2005, homeowners who wanted to install solar panels could get some help from the federal government: It would pay for about a third of that cost. But residential clean energy credits are going away at the end of the year. The recently passed GOP policy bill gets rid of those incentives.

It is partly because of those incentives that Creative Energies was able to expand in recent years, in a state that’s otherwise dominated by oil, gas, and coal. Co-owner Scott Kane showed off their giant shop building at their headquarters in Lander, Wyoming.

“We like to think of it as the epicenter of solar energy for the state of Wyoming,” Kane said.

Inside it feels like a full-on hardware store — tools, electrical supplies, solar panels and trucks, everything they need to service projects around the state. Kane said they built the shop a couple years ago.

“We noticed, like, ‘Woah there’s been a lot of demand for solar and we're having a hard time keeping up with the demand that's out there,’” said Kane.

The federal tax credit for residential rooftop solar was beefed up under the Biden administration, driving more business to Kane. But the incentive first came about under President George W. Bush. The original solar tax credit was supposed to taper down after just a couple years. “It's been extended because subsequent administrations saw that the program was working well,” Kane said.

But congressional Republicans voted to completely end the 30% tax credits, saying the solar industry had been subsidized long enough.

“So that went from being, you know, almost a 20-year-long program, to ending overnight,” said Kane. “So that really feels like a scramble right now.”

A scramble to install panels for the surge of homeowners who want the credit before it goes away. In fact, Kane has had to turn some customers away.

“We can't get their project built before the end of the year,” he said.

Kane is unsure whether demand will still be there when the price for solar installs goes up. His business is shifting from growth mode to maintenance.

“Rather than continuing to add people and and invest in vehicles and invest in new buildings, to more of a like, let's sustain the business mindset,” he said.

Still, Kane knows how to adapt. He helped found Creative Energies in 2001, when Wyoming’s fossil fuels were booming. The state is the top producer of coal in the country.

“Some might say that, ‘A renewable energy company — you're operating in Wyoming? Like that must feel like you're operating behind enemy lines,’” Kane said.

But he found a niche demographic, from eco-minded homeowners to survival types who do not want to rely on the grid.

“The idea really plays that like, ‘Hey, we grow our own food, we hunt for our own meat. Let's produce our own power,’” Kane said.

Federal tax credits for commercial buildings are not ending for another couple years, so Kane hopes to tap more into that market. Like the eastern Wyoming courthouse project, where electrician Andrew Weatherford feeds the cords to his work partner, Noah Rohrbacher.

“That should be it and we should be able to fire this system up and see what it’ll be able to do for the building,” Rohrbacher said.

The mine has been incredibly controversial. It received support from economic developers and some local lawmakers, while other lawmakers as well as some environmental groups voiced concerns.

In charge of the project is Highland Copper, a Canadian-based company with a U.S. subsidiary, Copperwood Resources Inc. According to the company’s website, the creation of the mine will boost the economy in the area, creating 300 construction jobs while meeting the state’s mining and environmental regulations. It is projected to generate a total capital of $425 million.

The project would be placed next to the Porcupine Mountains, Michigan’s largest state park at nearly 60,000 acres. It would be the closest facility to Lake Superior on record.

Tom Grotewohl is the founder of Protect the Porkies campaign. Grotewohl said that concerns over disruptions to outdoor recreation and negative impacts on the environment were the reasons why he does not support the implementation of the mining project.

Tribal Nation & Indigenous-led Organizations said in a letter to Governor Whitmer that the site lies within homelands ceded under the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, where their people retain rights to hunt, fish, and gather. Industrial mining on this scale threatens those rights, the letter read.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), copper mining makes up the largest percentage of processing waste in the US. The agency stated that mining of copper can concentrate and extract radioactive materials.

Grotewohl said that the project’s ore grade is 1.45%, meaning that for every ton of extract, 30 pounds would be copper and the other 1,970 pounds extracted would be waste.

A 2012 study found that over 90 percent of copper sulfide mines failed to contain seepage, spilling toxic waste materials into their surrounding areas. Grotewohl fears the mine could contaminate Lake Superior, the largest freshwater source on the North American continent.

Highland Copper said that the mine project would help revitalize communities, and has received public support from twenty-two units of government, ranging from townships to county boards. It said that the project would reduce reliance on foreign markets and help mitigate the growing copper supply deficiency.

Grotewohl is more skeptical. He said that prospective jobs would last 10.7 years at the maximum, which is the planned duration of the project.

“No amount of jobs justifies a terrible idea,” Grotewohl said. “Storing all that waste next to Lake Superior, 100 feet from Porcupine State park is a terrible idea.”

Harvard Economist James Stock’s research found that initially, mining is economically beneficial, but it erodes over time.

“I think it was very wise to cut funding for infrastructure in uninhabited areas, especially in a place where people visit to escape all of that stuff,” Grotewohl said. “There just aren't enough gains to outweigh the significant harms of this project.”

Grotewohl said their campaign will continue, because the project could still advance through private investment or other funding sources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13b32a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1522x799+0+512/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F00%2F75e03fee4e649af8b745c7b065a5%2Fcong-q-wu-porcupine-mountains.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 09:58:41.692370

Bob Ferguson on Thursday condemned the Trump Administration’s decision to revoke over $1.1 billion in federal energy funding for projects across Washington state.

Most significantly, the administration has pulled $1 billion from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNWH2), a regional initiative poised to generate more than 10,000 jobs and over $5 billion in local investment.

RELATED: Washington AG Nick Brown sues Trump administration over 'illegally withholding' climate funding

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,” said Ferguson. “These projects will lower costs, create jobs, and reduce air pollution. We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action.”

The Department of Energy selected the PNWH2 in 2023 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Managed by the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, the hub serves Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. It was designed to develop a clean hydrogen economy using the region’s hydropower and clean energy resources.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), who helped craft the H2Hubs program, called the cuts “unprecedented and corrupt.”

“Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work,” said Cantwell. “I will be fighting to restore these funds.”

Four Washington-based PNWH2 partner projects are directly affected:

Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102.8 million

Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157.3 million

Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce counties): $11.8 million

Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36.4 million

In total, 11 Washington energy projects were defunded, threatening progress toward the state’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Additional affected projects include:

Nippon Dynawave (Cowlitz County): $46.6 million

PACCAR Inc. (Skagit County): $68 million

CleanFiber Inc. (Lewis County): $10 million

Spokane Edo LLC (Spokane County): $5.3 million

SilFab Solar WA Inc. (Skagit County): $3 million

Washington State University (Whitman County): $9.8 million

In July 2024, the Department of Energy awarded PNWH2 $27.5 million in Phase 1 funding for initial planning. The full $1 billion federal investment was expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local funding and create over 10,000 jobs, mainly in rural areas.

Ferguson and Cantwell both pledged to take legal and legislative action to reverse the cuts.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/c5e55120-a0ab-4484-bb6a-b68a23810b19/20241219T144957/c5e55120-a0ab-4484-bb6a-b68a23810b19_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 08:03:43.569430

The DFA emphasized that Arkansas income tax is based on net income, and thus the Texas tax did not meet the statutory criteria for the credit.
Taxpayers’ Position The taxpayers argued that, despite its label, the Texas franchise tax is functionally a tax on net income.
The decision concluded that the Texas franchise tax qualifies as a “net income tax” within the meaning of Ark.
The TAC acknowledged that while the Texas franchise tax is calculated differently from Arkansas’s income tax, such differences exist among many states and do not disqualify the tax from being considered a net income tax.","Arkansas law provides a mechanism to alleviate the burden of double taxation for its residents who earn income in other states.

The decision rendered by the state brought some necessary clarity to a tax that appears facially different from most other state taxes.

Background

Under Ark. Code Ann. § 26-51-504, a resident individual taxpayer may claim a credit against their Arkansas income tax liability for income taxes paid to another state, provided that both jurisdictions tax the same income and the tax paid to the other state is “on or measured by net income.” This statutory framework reflects a longstanding public policy to prevent the inequity of taxing the same income twice.

A recent decision by the Arkansas Tax Appeals Commission (“TAC”) has clarified the scope of this credit in the context of the Texas franchise tax—a tax that has long occupied a gray area in multistate tax compliance due to its unique structure and nomenclature.

The Dispute

The taxpayers in this case were Arkansas residents and shareholders in an S corporation that conducted business in Texas. The S corporation paid Texas franchise tax, and the taxpayers claimed their pro rata share of that tax as a credit on their Arkansas individual income tax returns for tax years 2021 through 2023.

The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (“DFA”) denied the credit, asserting that the Texas franchise tax is not a qualifying “net income tax” under Arkansas law. According to the DFA, the Texas franchise tax is a privilege tax imposed for the right to do business in Texas and is calculated based on gross margin—defined as gross receipts minus either cost of goods sold or compensation—rather than net income. The DFA emphasized that Arkansas income tax is based on net income, and thus the Texas tax did not meet the statutory criteria for the credit. The taxpayers filed suit with the TAC.

Taxpayers’ Position

The taxpayers argued that, despite its label, the Texas franchise tax is functionally a tax on net income. They presented testimony from a certified public accountant and cited national accounting standards, including interpretations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which classify the Texas franchise tax as an income tax for financial reporting purposes. taxpayers further noted that the Arkansas statute does not require the tax to be labeled as an income tax, only that it be “on or measured by net income.”

Moreover, the taxpayers pointed to Ark. Code Ann. § 26-51-504(a)(2), which specifically addresses S corporations and allows resident shareholders to claim a credit for their share of income taxes paid by the S corporation to states that do not recognize S corporation status. They contended that Texas, while recognizing S corporations, does not impose a traditional income tax, and thus the franchise tax should be treated as a qualifying tax under this provision.

The Decision

In a significant ruling, the TAC reversed its prior position and granted the taxpayers’ petitions. The decision concluded that the Texas franchise tax qualifies as a “net income tax” within the meaning of Ark. Code Ann. §§ 26-51-504 and 26-51-403. The ruling emphasized that the statutory language focuses on the substance of the tax—whether it is measured by net income—rather than its label or the specific deductions allowed.

The TAC acknowledged that while the Texas franchise tax is calculated differently from Arkansas’s income tax, such differences exist among many states and do not disqualify the tax from being considered a net income tax. The decision also referenced the Multistate Tax Compact, codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 26-5-101, which supports a broader interpretation of what constitutes an income tax for purposes of interstate tax coordination.

Accordingly, the taxpayers were found to be entitled to credits against their Arkansas income tax liabilities for the taxes paid by the S corporation to Texas for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 tax years. The proposed assessments and partial refund denials were reversed, and the DFA was directed to proceed in accordance with the decision and applicable law.

Implications

This decision provides important clarity for Arkansas residents with multistate business interests, particularly those involved in pass-through entities operating in states like Texas and Tennessee that do not impose traditional income taxes. It affirms that the Arkansas credit for taxes paid to other states is not limited to taxes explicitly labeled as “income taxes,” but extends to taxes that are substantively measured by net income.

Tax professionals should take note of this decision when advising clients on multistate tax compliance and refund opportunities. The ruling also underscores the importance of examining the functional characteristics of a tax, rather than relying solely on its statutory label, when evaluating eligibility for credits under Arkansas law.

“This is a watershed moment for mercury waste management,” says John Magee, CEO of VLS Environmental Solutions.
“Our process provides the first true domestic solution for mercury disposal since the Mercury Export Ban Act took effect in 2013.
The site’s existing infrastructure and permitted capacity allow for the safe treatment and disposal of elemental mercury in compliance with U.S. hazardous waste regulations.
It’s a paradigm shift in mercury waste management,” he says.","VLS Environmental Solutions unveils a breakthrough in hazardous waste management with the launch of a patent-pending technology that enables the permanent disposal of elemental mercury. This is the first and only RCRA-compliant solution of its kind in the United States.

The company’s Texas Molecular facility in Deer Park now houses this technology, offering a long-awaited domestic solution for government and industrial entities grappling with mercury stockpiles since the Mercury Export Ban Act (MEBA) took effect in 2013. Under MEBA, U.S. exports of elemental mercury were banned, leaving industries without a permanent, regulatory-compliant disposal method.

“This is a watershed moment for mercury waste management,” says John Magee, CEO of VLS Environmental Solutions. “Our process provides the first true domestic solution for mercury disposal since the Mercury Export Ban Act took effect in 2013. Government agencies and industry stakeholders now have a viable, compliant option for final disposal.”

Addressing a regulatory gap

The Texas Molecular facility operates under full permits from both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The site’s existing infrastructure and permitted capacity allow for the safe treatment and disposal of elemental mercury in compliance with U.S. hazardous waste regulations.

Chris Lobue, executive vice president of hazardous waste, emphasizes the health and environmental risks posed by previous management methods. “Methods like indefinite long-term storage, or stabilization and landfill, just delay the problem and can pose potential serious risks,” he says. “There is a reason stabilization and landfill of mercury above the water table isn’t allowed under current EPA regulations. The elegance of the VLS solution is that it fits within existing regulations and uses a proven technology that was originally designed to protect drinking water sources.”

Implications for industry and government

The technology targets key sectors such as mining, energy, and chemicals, as well as federal agencies managing legacy mercury reserves. It offers a compliance-focused alternative to the cost and complexity of long-term storage or export-restricted options.

Robert Wheatley, chief strategy officer, adds that the launch signals more than just progress. “This is more than a technological advancement. It’s a paradigm shift in mercury waste management,” he says. “Our solution enables industries to resolve mercury challenges domestically, creating both environmental and economic value.”

Milestone in environmental safety

Operating since 1981, the Deer Park facility is now the only site in the U.S. with this level of mercury waste management capability. For safety professionals, this development highlights an important shift in risk mitigation strategy for one of the most persistent and dangerous forms of hazardous waste.

“The impact of this technology goes beyond regulatory compliance,” says Keith Cordesman, President of VLS. “It’s about protecting ecosystems, advancing sustainable development, and guiding industries toward a future built on responsible innovation.”

While the facility operates in the United States, Canadian safety managers with cross-border operations or legacy mercury holdings should note the implications of this new disposal pathway. The advancement opens the door for international partnerships and may influence similar regulatory or technological developments within Canada.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/cos/jims_638951001820940793.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 09:58:46.500871

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity.","General Motors (GM) (NYSE: GM), an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, continues to be a pivotal player in the global automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025. Founded in 1908 by William C. Durant, GM has a rich history as one of the world's largest motor-vehicle manufacturers, consistently leading the U.S. automotive market in total sales.

GM's core operations revolve around its four major automobile brands: Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac. Beyond these, the company holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling through SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile. Its diverse portfolio also includes a defense vehicles division, the vehicle safety and information services provider OnStar, the auto parts company ACDelco, and a financial lending arm, GM Financial. GM operates manufacturing plants in eight countries and maintains a significant global presence across North America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, and South America. The company's current structure was established in 2009 following a Chapter 11 reorganization.

As of Q3 2025, General Motors is demonstrating strong market relevance through robust sales performance and strategic advancements in electrification and autonomous driving. GM reported an 8% increase in overall U.S. sales for Q3 2025, reaching 710,347 units, outpacing the estimated 4% growth across the auto industry in the first half of 2025. This growth was fueled by strong demand across both its traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, particularly full-size trucks and SUVs, and its expanding electric vehicle (EV) lineup. Chevrolet remains GM's top-selling brand, with the Silverado truck showing robust sales. GM has solidified its position as the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla, surpassing Ford. EV sales more than doubled in Q2 2025, increasing 111% year-over-year, securing a 15% share of the U.S. EV market. In Q3 2025, GM set a new quarterly record with 66,501 EVs sold in the U.S., a 105% surge year-to-date from 2024 to over 144,000 units. The Chevrolet Equinox EV emerged as GM's top-selling EV in Q3 2025, becoming the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S. with over 25,000 units sold. Cadillac's luxury EVs, including the LYRIQ, OPTIQ, and VISTIQ, also performed strongly. GM's EV strategy is centered around its flexible and scalable Ultium battery platform, designed to significantly reduce production costs and achieve price parity with gasoline-powered vehicles.

General Motors remains a significant focus for investors and the broader automotive industry due to several interconnected factors: its strategic EV pivot and profitability, a balanced portfolio and financial strength, advancements in autonomous driving, innovation and capital allocation, and its navigation of global market dynamics. GM's commitment to innovation is evident in its substantial capital expenditures, projected at $10 billion to $11 billion for 2025, including investments in battery joint ventures. The company is also exploring AI applications to streamline design, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, aiming for increased efficiencies.

2. Historical Background

General Motors boasts a rich and complex history, marked by ambitious founding, rapid expansion through acquisitions, significant organizational transformations, and resilience in the face of numerous challenges, including a historic bankruptcy.

Founding Story and Early Milestones

General Motors was founded on September 16, 1908, in Flint, Michigan, by William C. Durant. Durant, a successful carriage manufacturer with his Durant-Dort Carriage Company, initially acquired the Buick Motor Company in 1904. His vision for GM was to create a holding company that would consolidate the burgeoning, yet fragmented, automobile market.

In its very early years, GM embarked on an aggressive acquisition spree. Durant's first acquisition for the new holding company was Olds Motor Works in November 1908. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of other prominent names in the automotive industry in 1909, including Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, and the Reliance Motor Car Company (predecessor of GMC). Notably, Durant even attempted to acquire Ford Motor Company in 1909, but the deal fell through due to a lack of bank financing.

Early innovations also marked GM's path. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering's Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) (which would later join GM) and Henry M. Leland invented the first electric self-starter, which was commercially introduced in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly made the hand crank obsolete.

Durant's aggressive expansion, however, led to over-leveraging, and he was forced out of the company by bankers in 1910. Undeterred, he co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Company with race car driver Louis Chevrolet in 1911. By 1916, Chevrolet's success allowed Durant to regain a controlling interest in GM, bringing Chevrolet into the corporate fold by 1918. In 1919, GM also established the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to provide financing for automotive customers, further solidifying its financial infrastructure.

Key Transformations and Major Acquisitions

The 1920s brought a significant transformation under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who replaced Durant after his second removal in 1920. Sloan reorganized GM from a collection of disparate units into a cohesive enterprise with a decentralized management structure, creating five main automotive divisions: Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Chevrolet. This structure balanced divisional autonomy with central corporate oversight and became a model for large industrial companies. Sloan also pioneered the concept of annual style changes for car models and strengthened GM's sales organization.

GM's growth continued internationally with the acquisition of Vauxhall Motors of England in 1925, an 80% stake in Germany's Adam Opel in 1929 (increased to 100% by 1931), and Holden of Australia in 1931. Domestically, GM also acquired the Fisher Body Company in 1926, allowing for vertical integration of body production. By 1929, GM had surpassed Ford to become the leading American passenger-car manufacturer, and by 1931, it was the world's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.

Following World War II, GM experienced substantial growth, becoming one of the world's largest employers and introducing iconic vehicles like the Corvette in 1953. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, GM began to face increasing challenges from foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda, struggling with quality problems, vehicle defects, and a slow response to changing consumer demands due to its unwieldy bureaucracy. This led to further restructuring efforts in the early 1990s under chairman Jack Smith, involving workforce reductions, cost-cutting, and the elimination of some product lines, including Oldsmobile.

In the late 1990s, GM made high-profile international acquisitions, such as Swedish automaker Saab and a stake in Japanese automaker Isuzu, as part of a global expansion strategy. The company also diversified and later divested non-automotive assets; for instance, it sold a 51% stake in GMAC (renamed Ally Financial) in 2006. More recently, in 2016, GM acquired Cruise Automation, a self-driving technology company, for $1.0 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards future mobility. Further recent acquisitions include Tooling & Equipment International in November 2023 and ALGOLiON in June 2023.

Major Challenges

General Motors has weathered several significant storms throughout its history:

Early Financial Troubles: William C. Durant's aggressive acquisitions led to substantial debt, causing him to lose control of GM twice, first in 1910 and again in 1920.

Stagnation and Competition (1980s-2000s): Decades of dominance led to an internal bureaucracy that was slow to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and the rise of fuel-efficient and reliable vehicles from foreign competitors. This resulted in declining market share and quality issues. GM also lost its position as the world's largest automaker to Toyota in 2008.

2009 Bankruptcy and Bailout: The most profound challenge came during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. GM faced a severe cash crisis, declining sales, unsustainable legacy costs (including healthcare and pension obligations), and a bloated product portfolio. To avoid collapse, GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009, making it the largest industrial bankruptcy in U.S. history. The U.S. government provided $51 billion in financial assistance, enabling a rapid restructuring. This process involved closing unprofitable plants, discontinuing underperforming brands (such as Pontiac, Hummer, and Saturn), and renegotiating labor contracts. A ""New GM"" emerged from bankruptcy on July 10, 2009, with a leaner cost structure and a renewed focus.

Transition to Electric Vehicles (2020s): In recent years, GM has faced new challenges in its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The company reported losses exceeding $7 billion in its EV division in 2024, attributed to high upfront costs for research, development, and manufacturing. Shifting consumer preferences, concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and competition from new players like Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers pose significant hurdles. GM is also balancing its traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production with EV manufacturing, while navigating potential profit declines due to slower EV growth.

Global Market and Trade Pressures: GM faces ongoing challenges in international markets, including losses in China and the significant impact of tariffs on its profitability, given that nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles are assembled outside the country. The company has also contended with disruptions like cyberattacks affecting its dealership networks.

Despite these challenges, General Motors has demonstrated a consistent ability to adapt and transform, remaining a major force in the global automotive industry for over a century.

3. Business Model

GM's business model is centered on a diverse portfolio of vehicle brands catering to various market segments, supported by strong manufacturing capabilities, an extensive dealer network, and substantial investments in research and development (R&D). The company is strategically shifting towards an all-electric future, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040, though it has adjusted some of its aggressive EV transition plans in response to market realities. Concurrently, GM is increasing its focus on software monetization and connected services as new, high-margin revenue streams.

Revenue Sources

GM's primary revenue source continues to be the sale of vehicles across its various brands (Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, Cadillac). In 2024, GM reported substantial revenue of $187.44 billion, with North America being its strongest market. While the traditional automotive sales remain core, the company is actively developing and expanding alternative revenue streams:

Electric Vehicles (EVs): GM is making significant investments in EVs, with a goal to increase EV wholesale volumes to 300,000 units in 2025, up from 189,000 in 2024. The company expects EV profitability to improve by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025 due to scale efficiencies and cost reductions.

Software and Services: This is a growing area of focus, with GM aiming for software to become a $10+ billion revenue line by the late 2020s. The company plans to double its revenue from new software platforms and connectivity by 2030, adding 50 new in-vehicle digital services by 2026. Deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise stood at $4 billion at the end of Q2 2025.

GM Financial: This segment provides financial lending services and contributes a steady profit stream to GM.

Defense Vehicles: GM also has a division that produces military vehicles for the United States government and military.

Product Lines

GM's diverse product portfolio includes both gasoline-powered and electric vehicles across various types and price points.

Brands: GM's core brands in North America are Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac. Globally, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.

Vehicle Types (Internal Combustion Engine – ICE): The company offers a wide range of vehicles including economy cars, trucks, SUVs, and luxury vehicles. Full-size pickups (Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra) and full-size SUVs (Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban, Cadillac Escalade) remain major profit drivers, especially in the U.S. market.

Vehicle Types (Electric Vehicles – EVs): GM is rapidly expanding its EV portfolio, utilizing its Ultium battery platform. Key EV models in 2025 include:

Chevrolet: Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Silverado EV, BrightDrop commercial delivery vans.

Cadillac: Lyriq, Escalade IQ, Optiq, Vistiq.

Consumer financial health is improving, which is fueling demand for vehicles. Despite this, global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak, with an expected increase of just 2.7%, reaching 98.7 million units in 2025. Some forecasts predict a drop in U.S. sales to 15.4 million units due to softening demand and tariff impacts. However, others project new vehicle sales in the U.S. to hit 16.5 million units in 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year. GM itself reported strong Q3 2025 U.S. sales, up 8% year-over-year, leading the industry in overall sales and continuing to grow in both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

2. Interest Rates and Inflation:

High interest rates continue to be a significant macroeconomic factor. Auto loan rates have been elevated for several years, with average rates for new car loans around 7.6% and used cars between 10-15% as of mid-April 2025. These higher financing costs deter potential buyers and prolong ownership cycles of existing vehicles. Inflation has been a challenge, driving up material costs and consequently vehicle prices. While inflation has cooled globally and in the U.S. in 2024, there's a threat of rebound. The expectation is for interest rates to continue a slow decline in 2025, which could boost consumer buying power and demand.

3. Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The imposition of tariffs is a major concern. Recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming tariffs on auto parts are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices by an estimated 10-15%. The incoming U.S. administration is predicted to introduce higher tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, which could further strain global supply chains and weaken consumer demand. This situation initially sparked a short-term sales boom as consumers rushed to buy before prices surged, but the long-term forecast indicates a sales decline.

Supply Chain Issues

Retail investor sentiment around GM stock on Stocktwits saw a shift. On October 1, 2025, it fell from ""extremely bullish"" to ""bullish"" territory, with message volume remaining at ""high"" levels. By October 3, 2025, sentiment on Stocktwits had further simmered down to ""neutral"" from ""bullish"" amidst continued ""high"" levels of chatter, potentially influenced by ongoing discussions around Trump truck tariffs. Discussions on platforms like Reddit from earlier in 2025 noted a lack of excitement for the U.S. automotive industry among investors due to a slowdown in EVs and autonomous vehicles, as well as regulatory volatility, despite GM beating Wall Street estimates and forecasting strong results for 2025. GM's strategic move to extend the $7,500 EV lease tax credit through dealer programs, even after the federal credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, has been viewed as a short-term boost to demand and investor confidence, potentially cushioning the impact of reduced consumer incentives. This adaptability has encouraged Wall Street and likely influences retail sentiment positively in the short term.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex and evolving landscape of regulatory, policy, and geopolitical factors as of October 3, 2025. The company faces significant challenges and opportunities stemming from shifts in government incentives, trade policies, environmental regulations, and the geopolitical competition in critical automotive technologies like electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving.

Regulatory Factors

1. Emissions and Environmental Regulations:

Stricter Standards & Pushback: While GM aims for an all-electric, zero-emissions world and carbon neutrality by 2040 (with tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles eliminated by 2035), the company, alongside other automakers, is actively urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to relax stringent Biden-era emissions limits for 2027 and beyond. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing GM, argues these targets are not feasible due to current market conditions, charging infrastructure limitations, supply chain issues, and vehicle affordability challenges, further exacerbated by the expiration of federal EV tax credits.

Renewable Energy Goals: GM has secured all necessary energy sourcing agreements to power its U.S. facilities with 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025, accelerating its global goal to 2035.

2. Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Regulations:

Industry Call for Consistency: The automotive industry, including GM, is advocating for consistent federal autonomous vehicle regulations in the U.S. to prevent a ""harmful patchwork of state laws"" and maintain a competitive edge against China.

Loosened Federal Rules: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has introduced the Automated Vehicle (AV) Framework, which aims to streamline crash reporting, override local laws with national preemption, and facilitate the commercial deployment of AVs. This framework allows manufacturers to sell up to 2,500 vehicles annually without fully complying with traditional federal regulations, including those for vehicles without steering wheels or pedals.

GM's Strategic Pivot: Following the shutdown of its Cruise robotaxi subsidiary in late 2024 due to high-profile accidents and regulatory scrutiny, GM is refocusing its autonomous driving efforts on developing driverless technology for personal vehicles. The company is rehiring former Cruise employees and expanding its AV development teams.

3. Safety Regulations:

ADAS Compliance: Stricter requirements for the calibration and inspection of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and updates to NHTSA safety ratings necessitate enhanced quality controls throughout GM's manufacturing and servicing processes. States like California are implementing Vehicle Safety Systems Inspection (VSSI) programs, mandating inspections for ADAS features.

Cybersecurity: Given the increasing software integration in vehicles, compliance with cybersecurity regulations like ISO/SAE 21434 (road vehicle cybersecurity) and UNECE WP.29 (software update and cybersecurity management systems) is critical. This involves secure coding, penetration testing, maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and real-time threat monitoring.

4. Manufacturing and Quality Standards:

GM updated its Customer Specific Requirements for IATF 16949, effective March 1, 2025, with clarifications on Quality Management System (QMS) Gap Assessments for manufacturing facilities.

Policy Factors

1. Government Incentives for Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Expiration of Federal Tax Credit: The federal $7,500 EV tax credit officially expired on September 30, 2025, under new policies.

GM's Workaround: To mitigate the impact, GM and Ford have implemented programs where their financing arms make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the expiration, allowing them to claim the credit. These savings are then passed on to consumers through competitive lease terms, maintaining some level of incentive, at least through the end of the year for Ford. GM Financial placed down payments on approximately 30,000 EVs before October 1st.

Uncertainty for Long-Term Demand: While these measures cushion short-term demand, the long-term sustainability of EV sales without direct government subsidies remains a significant concern for GM. There are also concerns within the industry about losing other battery production tax credits.

2. Trade Policies (Tariffs):

U.S. Tariffs: The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, effective April 3, 2025 (vehicles) and May 3, 2025 (parts), with exemptions for USMCA-compliant vehicles (75% North American content).

Financial Impact on GM: GM projects these tariffs will cost the company between $4 billion and $5 billion in 2025, leading to a reduction in its profit forecasts. The automaker aims to offset around 30% of these costs through supply chain adjustments, cost reduction initiatives, and increasing the U.S. content in its vehicles. Tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and South Korea, coupled with retaliatory tariffs, are expected to raise GM's costs, potentially increasing new vehicle prices by up to 1%.

Supply Chain Restructuring: These tariffs are driving a restructuring of supply chains, with an increased focus on nearshoring or reshoring production within USMCA countries to reduce tariff exposure. GM is working to strengthen its domestic supply chain.

3. Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE):

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (OBBBA) in 2025 has effectively loosened U.S. EPA and miles-per-gallon (MPG) requirements by reducing penalties for non-compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to zero. This change provides automakers with more flexibility in vehicle production. Despite this, the 2025 CAFE standards still mandate higher fuel efficiency and greater EV integration.

Geopolitical Factors

1. U.S.-China Relations:

Trade Tensions: Intensified trade tensions between the U.S. and China throughout 2025, including tariffs, have disrupted global supply chains.

GM's China Strategy: GM has suspended exports to China, indicating an end to low-cost trans-Pacific auto trade. However, its manufacturing operations within China are exempt from cross-border tariffs, which could lead to improved margins from local production. GM's Ultium platform and partnerships with Chinese suppliers are seen as opportunities to capture a significant share of China's EV market by 2026.

Competition and National Security: China's dominance in EV manufacturing and critical minerals processing (like lithium) raises national security concerns for the U.S. The push for consistent federal AV regulations is partly driven by a desire to avoid ceding technological leadership to China.

2. Supply Chain Resilience and Critical Minerals:

Domestic Sourcing: The U.S. government has taken a strategic stake in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to secure a domestic supply of lithium. This initiative aims to reduce vulnerability to international trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions, providing more predictable and stable input pricing for GM's Ultium battery platform and creating a competitive advantage for U.S. manufacturers. This vertical integration helps address China's significant control over global lithium processing.

Global Restructuring: Geopolitical risks are driving a broader trend of ""reshoring"" or ""friendshoring"" in global supply chains, moving away from hyper-globalization. GM's efforts to increase U.S. content and adapt its supply chain are aligned with this trend.

3. Broader Geopolitical Risks:

Geopolitical risks are a core concern, influencing financial stability, supply chains, and regulatory environments globally. While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for GM, ongoing conflicts or instability in key regions could impact energy prices, raw material availability, and consumer sentiment.

Compliance Requirements (General)

To navigate this landscape, GM's compliance requirements include:

Maintaining a robust compliance governance framework that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability across the organization.

Conducting thorough and regular regulatory audits and risk assessments.

Providing ongoing, tailored training and clear communication to employees at all levels regarding their compliance responsibilities.

Implementing continuous improvement processes and incident preparedness, including regularly updating compliance policies and conducting recall simulations.

Geopolitical Opportunities

""Made in America"" Appeal: The domestic production of EVs and battery components, supported by government initiatives like the Lithium Americas-GM venture, offers marketing advantages by appealing to consumers concerned about domestic manufacturing and jobs.

Reduced Carbon Footprint: Shorter transportation distances from domestic supply chains align with environmental motivations, enhancing the appeal of GM's EVs to eco-conscious consumers.

Innovation in AVs: Loosened federal AV regulations could provide a clearer path for GM to accelerate its development and commercial deployment of personal autonomous vehicle technologies.

In summary, GM is actively adapting to a dynamic environment where government policies, especially concerning trade tariffs and EV incentives, significantly impact its financial outlook and strategic decisions. The company is strategically adjusting its production, supply chain, and product development (particularly for EVs and AVs) to comply with evolving regulations, capitalize on domestic opportunities, and mitigate geopolitical risks.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025, marked by strategic shifts, evolving market dynamics, and a mix of optimistic and cautious projections. The company is balancing its ambitious electric vehicle (EV) goals with sustained investment in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, while also grappling with macroeconomic factors and trade policies.

GM's Future Outlook (as of October 3, 2025)

Short-Term Projections (2025-2027):

Sales and Revenue: GM's total U.S. vehicle sales were up 8% in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, with growth in both gasoline and electric vehicles. EV sales in the U.S. more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching a record 66,501 units, making GM the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. This surge was partly driven by consumers buying EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30, 2025. GM is expected to see its top line contract by 4% in fiscal year 2025 and another 2% in FY26, reaching approximately $175.47 billion. However, other analyst projections suggest revenue of $178.9 billion in 2025, growing to $190.075 billion in 2026 and $193.1 billion in 2027.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Analysts project GM's EPS to be around $9.85 for 2025, rising to $11.45 in 2026 and $12.25 in 2027. Another projection estimates EPS to descend from multi-year highs of $10.60 in FY24 to $9.44 per share in FY25, before rebounding 2% to $9.66 in FY26.

Production: Global output for GM's wholly-owned brands is anticipated to decrease by about 2.5% in 2025, with a further decline projected for 2026, primarily due to an expected reduction in overall North American demand. Growth is then expected to return in 2027.

Stock Price: Short-term stock price forecasts for GM vary significantly. Some predict an average price of $33.15 in 2025, with a high of $45.08, while others suggest a year-end 2025 price of $68.44 or $67.12. For 2026, predictions range from an average of $56.39 to $76.08 or $80.74.

Long-Term Projections (Beyond 2027):

Revenue and Earnings: GM's outlook for 2028 anticipates $185.3 billion in revenue and $8.0 billion in earnings.

Stock Price: Long-term stock price forecasts show a wide range. For 2028, average predictions span from $44.92 to $120.53. By 2030, forecasts range from an average of $51.39 to $138.32. Further out, some analyses suggest GM's stock could reach an average of $59.71 by 2040 and $81.70 by 2050, while other predictions are more optimistic, reaching $150 by 2034 and $135.72 by 2035.

Decarbonization Targets: GM has set short-term (up to 2027), medium-term (2028-2035), and long-term (2036-2050) greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, covering at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and relevant Scope 3 emissions. The company aims for net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for General Motors is predicated on several key factors:

Favorable Trade Agreements: Progress in trade agreements, such as the one with South Korea, could significantly reduce tariff burdens. Further agreements with Canada and Mexico could provide additional relief, potentially improving GM's cost structure beyond pre-tariff levels.

Strong Free Cash Flow and Capital Returns: GM boasts a substantial 26% free cash flow yield. Analysts anticipate that as macroeconomic uncertainties subside and its financial position stabilizes, GM will resume aggressive capital return strategies, including robust share buyback programs and potentially increased dividend payments.

North American Market Strength: UBS projects GM's North American margins could return to the 8-10% target range in the coming years, surpassing the consensus view.

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity. The company's record Q3 2025 U.S. EV sales, led by models like the Equinox EV (the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S.), demonstrate strong demand for its electric offerings. GM's Ultium battery platform, designed for modularity and flexibility, is central to its EV strategy, aiming to reduce battery costs and make EVs more competitive.

Strategic Production Shifts: GM is making strategic production shifts to mitigate tariff risks, including a $4 billion investment in 2025 to upgrade U.S. assembly plants to boost high-margin production and reduce exposure to tariffs.

Bear Case Scenarios

The bear case for General Motors highlights several significant challenges:

Ongoing Tariff Pressures: Tariffs continue to pose a significant threat to GM's profitability. With nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles assembled outside the country, GM is vulnerable to import tariffs, which could result in an annual impact of approximately $5 billion on its bottom line without mitigation. Reciprocal tariffs could further increase costs, potentially raising total tariffs on some imports to 40% or 50%, leading to higher vehicle prices and reduced sales volumes.

EV Market Headwinds: GM's electrification ambitions have encountered a ""harsh reality check"" due to slowing consumer adoption, the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and inadequate charging infrastructure. GM's EV penetration stood at only 6% of unit sales year-to-date in Q2 2025.

Macroeconomic Uncertainties: General macroeconomic uncertainties could impact GM's financial position and its ability to resume aggressive capital return strategies.

Weak Gross Profit Margin: A relatively weak gross profit margin of 10.97% suggests room for operational improvement, indicating potential vulnerability to cost pressures.

Intense Competition: The EV sector is expected to be fiercely competitive, which may constrain opportunities for margin improvements.

Legal and Political Risks: Some analysts cite potential risks from illegal data harvesting and transmission class action lawsuits, as well as a potentially anti-EV stance from a Trump administration, which could thwart growth efforts.

Potential Strategic Pivots

GM is undertaking several strategic pivots to adapt to the evolving automotive industry:

Reassessment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Strategy: GM is scaling back its investment in the Cruise robotaxi project, moving away from capital-intensive ride-hailing ambitions. Instead, the company is refocusing on personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) by leveraging its existing Super Cruise system, which is available on numerous models and accumulates millions of miles monthly.

Balancing EV and ICE Investments: While committed to EVs, GM has slowed its EV rollout and is reinvesting in internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms, particularly focusing on high-margin V8 trucks and SUVs. This pragmatic approach acknowledges slowing EV consumer adoption and aims to capitalize on profitable traditional vehicle segments.

2. Historical Background

General Motors boasts a rich and complex history, marked by ambitious founding, rapid expansion through acquisitions, significant organizational transformations, and resilience in the face of numerous challenges, including a historic bankruptcy.

Founding Story and Early Milestones

General Motors was founded on September 16, 1908, in Flint, Michigan, by William C. Durant. Durant, a successful carriage manufacturer with his Durant-Dort Carriage Company, initially acquired the Buick Motor Company in 1904. His vision for GM was to create a holding company that would consolidate the burgeoning, yet fragmented, automobile market.

In its very early years, GM embarked on an aggressive acquisition spree. Durant's first acquisition for the new holding company was Olds Motor Works in November 1908. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of other prominent names in the automotive industry in 1909, including Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, and the Reliance Motor Car Company (predecessor of GMC). Notably, Durant even attempted to acquire Ford Motor Company in 1909, but the deal fell through due to a lack of bank financing.

Early innovations also marked GM's path. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering's Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) (which would later join GM) and Henry M. Leland invented the first electric self-starter, which was commercially introduced in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly made the hand crank obsolete.

Durant's aggressive expansion, however, led to over-leveraging, and he was forced out of the company by bankers in 1910. Undeterred, he co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Company with race car driver Louis Chevrolet in 1911. By 1916, Chevrolet's success allowed Durant to regain a controlling interest in GM, bringing Chevrolet into the corporate fold by 1918. In 1919, GM also established the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to provide financing for automotive customers, further solidifying its financial infrastructure.

Key Transformations and Major Acquisitions

The 1920s brought a significant transformation under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who replaced Durant after his second removal in 1920. Sloan reorganized GM from a collection of disparate units into a cohesive enterprise with a decentralized management structure, creating five main automotive divisions: Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Chevrolet. This structure balanced divisional autonomy with central corporate oversight and became a model for large industrial companies. Sloan also pioneered the concept of annual style changes for car models and strengthened GM's sales organization.

GM's growth continued internationally with the acquisition of Vauxhall Motors of England in 1925, an 80% stake in Germany's Adam Opel in 1929 (increased to 100% by 1931), and Holden of Australia in 1931. Domestically, GM also acquired the Fisher Body Company in 1926, allowing for vertical integration of body production. By 1929, GM had surpassed Ford to become the leading American passenger-car manufacturer, and by 1931, it was the world's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.

Following World War II, GM experienced substantial growth, becoming one of the world's largest employers and introducing iconic vehicles like the Corvette in 1953. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, GM began to face increasing challenges from foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda, struggling with quality problems, vehicle defects, and a slow response to changing consumer demands due to its unwieldy bureaucracy. This led to further restructuring efforts in the early 1990s under chairman Jack Smith, involving workforce reductions, cost-cutting, and the elimination of some product lines, including Oldsmobile.

In the late 1990s, GM made high-profile international acquisitions, such as Swedish automaker Saab and a stake in Japanese automaker Isuzu, as part of a global expansion strategy. The company also diversified and later divested non-automotive assets; for instance, it sold a 51% stake in GMAC (renamed Ally Financial) in 2006. More recently, in 2016, GM acquired Cruise Automation, a self-driving technology company, for $1.0 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards future mobility. Further recent acquisitions include Tooling & Equipment International in November 2023 and ALGOLiON in June 2023.

Major Challenges

General Motors has weathered several significant storms throughout its history:

Early Financial Troubles: William C. Durant's aggressive acquisitions led to substantial debt, causing him to lose control of GM twice, first in 1910 and again in 1920.

Stagnation and Competition (1980s-2000s): Decades of dominance led to an internal bureaucracy that was slow to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and the rise of fuel-efficient and reliable vehicles from foreign competitors. This resulted in declining market share and quality issues. GM also lost its position as the world's largest automaker to Toyota in 2008.

2009 Bankruptcy and Bailout: The most profound challenge came during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. GM faced a severe cash crisis, declining sales, unsustainable legacy costs (including healthcare and pension obligations), and a bloated product portfolio. To avoid collapse, GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009, making it the largest industrial bankruptcy in U.S. history. The U.S. government provided $51 billion in financial assistance, enabling a rapid restructuring. This process involved closing unprofitable plants, discontinuing underperforming brands (such as Pontiac, Hummer, and Saturn), and renegotiating labor contracts. A ""New GM"" emerged from bankruptcy on July 10, 2009, with a leaner cost structure and a renewed focus.

Transition to Electric Vehicles (2020s): In recent years, GM has faced new challenges in its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The company reported losses exceeding $7 billion in its EV division in 2024, attributed to high upfront costs for research, development, and manufacturing. Shifting consumer preferences, concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and competition from new players like Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers pose significant hurdles. GM is also balancing its traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production with EV manufacturing, while navigating potential profit declines due to slower EV growth.

Global Market and Trade Pressures: GM faces ongoing challenges in international markets, including losses in China and the significant impact of tariffs on its profitability, given that nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles are assembled outside the country. The company has also contended with disruptions like cyberattacks affecting its dealership networks.

Despite these challenges, General Motors has demonstrated a consistent ability to adapt and transform, remaining a major force in the global automotive industry for over a century.

GM aims for its North American EV portfolio to be solidly profitable by 2025 and plans to scale EV capacity in the region to over 1 million units annually.

However, the overall EV market is experiencing shifts. While EV sales continue to gain market share in the U.S., their growth rate slowed to 10% in 2024, compared to 40% in 2023. The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, is expected to lead to a temporary decline in EV sales in the next quarter, with executives anticipating a significant drop in EV market share through the end of 2025. This has led some OEMs to revise production plans and focus more on hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles due to their affordability and flexibility. GM is actively expanding its EV charging network in collaboration with partners like EVGo and IONNA.

2. Autonomous Driving (AV) Development:

After experiencing setbacks with its Cruise autonomous-vehicle business, including shuttering Cruise in 2024 and laying off employees earlier in 2025, GM is renewing its push into autonomous driving. The company is refocusing its efforts on developing autonomous cars for personal use, rather than a robotaxi service, with the ultimate goal of achieving hands-free, eyes-free driving and eventually fully driverless cars (SAE Level 5 autonomy). GM is seeking to rehire former Cruise employees and has integrated Cruise's technical teams into a single effort to advance autonomous and assisted driving, building on the progress of its Super Cruise system. This strategic realignment is expected to lower spending by over $1 billion annually after the proposed plan is completed in the first half of 2025.

3. Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and Connected Car Technology:

The automotive industry is rapidly moving towards software-defined vehicles, where features and functionality are increasingly determined by software, allowing for continuous upgrades and new features throughout a vehicle's lifecycle. This trend, coupled with the integration of AI and emerging technologies, is a key factor in addressing industry challenges and evolving consumer expectations. Voice assistants are becoming more prominent in vehicles due to customization and seamless AI integration.

4. Competition and Manufacturing Flexibility:

Rising competition from cost-advantaged Chinese manufacturers, who hold a significant competitive edge, is a major pressure point for OEMs. This is driving traditional automakers to cut costs, streamline operations, and invest in advanced technologies. Flexibility in manufacturing platforms is crucial for OEMs like GM to adapt to changing market dynamics, such as the EV transition and evolving consumer preferences. Partnerships, like those between Volkswagen and Rivian for software-defined vehicle technology platforms, are becoming common to share costs and accelerate advancements.

Macro Drivers

1. Economic Growth and Consumer Demand:

The U.S. economy in 2025 is described as a ""Goldilocks economy"" by some, with a positive outlook and projected GDP growth of 2.6%, consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Consumer financial health is improving, which is fueling demand for vehicles. Despite this, global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak, with an expected increase of just 2.7%, reaching 98.7 million units in 2025. Some forecasts predict a drop in U.S. sales to 15.4 million units due to softening demand and tariff impacts. However, others project new vehicle sales in the U.S. to hit 16.5 million units in 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year. GM itself reported strong Q3 2025 U.S. sales, up 8% year-over-year, leading the industry in overall sales and continuing to grow in both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

2. Interest Rates and Inflation:

High interest rates continue to be a significant macroeconomic factor. Auto loan rates have been elevated for several years, with average rates for new car loans around 7.6% and used cars between 10-15% as of mid-April 2025. These higher financing costs deter potential buyers and prolong ownership cycles of existing vehicles. Inflation has been a challenge, driving up material costs and consequently vehicle prices. While inflation has cooled globally and in the U.S. in 2024, there's a threat of rebound. The expectation is for interest rates to continue a slow decline in 2025, which could boost consumer buying power and demand.

3. Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The imposition of tariffs is a major concern. Recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming tariffs on auto parts are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices by an estimated 10-15%. The incoming U.S. administration is predicted to introduce higher tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, which could further strain global supply chains and weaken consumer demand. This situation initially sparked a short-term sales boom as consumers rushed to buy before prices surged, but the long-term forecast indicates a sales decline.

Supply Chain Issues

1. Semiconductor Shortages:

The automotive industry continues to grapple with persistent semiconductor shortages, especially for mature nodes (40 nanometers and above), which are critical for many vehicle components. This shortage has been a bottleneck in automotive production since the pandemic, leading to delays, reduced inventory, and increased costs. While some initial oversupply from previous years might temporarily affect supplier revenues through 2025, undersupply for certain devices could resurface in the second half of the year. The demand for analog chips, which are often produced at mature process nodes, is expected to increase by 23% in cars by 2026 compared to 2022.

2. Critical Component Shortages and Raw Material Costs:

Beyond semiconductors, the industry faces ongoing shortages of specialized metals and other critical components, leading to production delays and increased prices for vehicle repairs and new car purchases. Material costs have been on the rise due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Freight delays and rising shipping costs further exacerbate these issues, increasing expenses for suppliers and ultimately consumers. Manufacturers are responding by diversifying suppliers, investing in domestic production, and building more resilient supply chains. GM itself faced a major recall of 721,000 full-size trucks and SUVs (2021-2024 models) due to manufacturing defects in crankshafts and connecting rods, highlighting the impact of component quality issues.

3. Labor Shortages and Geopolitical Instability:

Labor shortages remain a critical challenge for automotive suppliers. Geopolitical instability and potential port strikes also pose ongoing threats to the supply chain. Regulatory scrutiny on labor compliance risks, particularly concerning forced labor in the supply chain, is also increasing.

Cyclical Effects on the Automotive Industry

This framework allows manufacturers to sell up to 2,500 vehicles annually without fully complying with traditional federal regulations, including those for vehicles without steering wheels or pedals.

GM's Strategic Pivot: Following the shutdown of its Cruise robotaxi subsidiary in late 2024 due to high-profile accidents and regulatory scrutiny, GM is refocusing its autonomous driving efforts on developing driverless technology for personal vehicles. The company is rehiring former Cruise employees and expanding its AV development teams.

3. Safety Regulations:

ADAS Compliance: Stricter requirements for the calibration and inspection of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and updates to NHTSA safety ratings necessitate enhanced quality controls throughout GM's manufacturing and servicing processes. States like California are implementing Vehicle Safety Systems Inspection (VSSI) programs, mandating inspections for ADAS features.

Cybersecurity: Given the increasing software integration in vehicles, compliance with cybersecurity regulations like ISO/SAE 21434 (road vehicle cybersecurity) and UNECE WP.29 (software update and cybersecurity management systems) is critical. This involves secure coding, penetration testing, maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and real-time threat monitoring.

4. Manufacturing and Quality Standards:

GM updated its Customer Specific Requirements for IATF 16949, effective March 1, 2025, with clarifications on Quality Management System (QMS) Gap Assessments for manufacturing facilities.

Policy Factors

1. Government Incentives for Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Expiration of Federal Tax Credit: The federal $7,500 EV tax credit officially expired on September 30, 2025, under new policies.

GM's Workaround: To mitigate the impact, GM and Ford have implemented programs where their financing arms make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the expiration, allowing them to claim the credit. These savings are then passed on to consumers through competitive lease terms, maintaining some level of incentive, at least through the end of the year for Ford. GM Financial placed down payments on approximately 30,000 EVs before October 1st.

Uncertainty for Long-Term Demand: While these measures cushion short-term demand, the long-term sustainability of EV sales without direct government subsidies remains a significant concern for GM. There are also concerns within the industry about losing other battery production tax credits.

2. Trade Policies (Tariffs):

U.S. Tariffs: The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, effective April 3, 2025 (vehicles) and May 3, 2025 (parts), with exemptions for USMCA-compliant vehicles (75% North American content).

Financial Impact on GM: GM projects these tariffs will cost the company between $4 billion and $5 billion in 2025, leading to a reduction in its profit forecasts. The automaker aims to offset around 30% of these costs through supply chain adjustments, cost reduction initiatives, and increasing the U.S. content in its vehicles. Tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and South Korea, coupled with retaliatory tariffs, are expected to raise GM's costs, potentially increasing new vehicle prices by up to 1%.

Supply Chain Restructuring: These tariffs are driving a restructuring of supply chains, with an increased focus on nearshoring or reshoring production within USMCA countries to reduce tariff exposure. GM is working to strengthen its domestic supply chain.

3. Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE):

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (OBBBA) in 2025 has effectively loosened U.S. EPA and miles-per-gallon (MPG) requirements by reducing penalties for non-compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to zero. This change provides automakers with more flexibility in vehicle production. Despite this, the 2025 CAFE standards still mandate higher fuel efficiency and greater EV integration.

Geopolitical Factors

1. U.S.-China Relations:

Trade Tensions: Intensified trade tensions between the U.S. and China throughout 2025, including tariffs, have disrupted global supply chains.

GM's China Strategy: GM has suspended exports to China, indicating an end to low-cost trans-Pacific auto trade. However, its manufacturing operations within China are exempt from cross-border tariffs, which could lead to improved margins from local production. GM's Ultium platform and partnerships with Chinese suppliers are seen as opportunities to capture a significant share of China's EV market by 2026.

Competition and National Security: China's dominance in EV manufacturing and critical minerals processing (like lithium) raises national security concerns for the U.S. The push for consistent federal AV regulations is partly driven by a desire to avoid ceding technological leadership to China.

2. Supply Chain Resilience and Critical Minerals:

Domestic Sourcing: The U.S. government has taken a strategic stake in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to secure a domestic supply of lithium. This initiative aims to reduce vulnerability to international trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions, providing more predictable and stable input pricing for GM's Ultium battery platform and creating a competitive advantage for U.S. manufacturers. This vertical integration helps address China's significant control over global lithium processing.

Global Restructuring: Geopolitical risks are driving a broader trend of ""reshoring"" or ""friendshoring"" in global supply chains, moving away from hyper-globalization. GM's efforts to increase U.S. content and adapt its supply chain are aligned with this trend.

3. Broader Geopolitical Risks:

Geopolitical risks are a core concern, influencing financial stability, supply chains, and regulatory environments globally. While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for GM, ongoing conflicts or instability in key regions could impact energy prices, raw material availability, and consumer sentiment.

Compliance Requirements (General)

To navigate this landscape, GM's compliance requirements include:

Maintaining a robust compliance governance framework that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability across the organization.

Conducting thorough and regular regulatory audits and risk assessments.

Providing ongoing, tailored training and clear communication to employees at all levels regarding their compliance responsibilities.

Implementing continuous improvement processes and incident preparedness, including regularly updating compliance policies and conducting recall simulations.

Geopolitical Opportunities

""Made in America"" Appeal: The domestic production of EVs and battery components, supported by government initiatives like the Lithium Americas-GM venture, offers marketing advantages by appealing to consumers concerned about domestic manufacturing and jobs.

Reduced Carbon Footprint: Shorter transportation distances from domestic supply chains align with environmental motivations, enhancing the appeal of GM's EVs to eco-conscious consumers.

Innovation in AVs: Loosened federal AV regulations could provide a clearer path for GM to accelerate its development and commercial deployment of personal autonomous vehicle technologies.

In summary, GM is actively adapting to a dynamic environment where government policies, especially concerning trade tariffs and EV incentives, significantly impact its financial outlook and strategic decisions. The company is strategically adjusting its production, supply chain, and product development (particularly for EVs and AVs) to comply with evolving regulations, capitalize on domestic opportunities, and mitigate geopolitical risks.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025, marked by strategic shifts, evolving market dynamics, and a mix of optimistic and cautious projections. The company is balancing its ambitious electric vehicle (EV) goals with sustained investment in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, while also grappling with macroeconomic factors and trade policies.

GM's Future Outlook (as of October 3, 2025)

Short-Term Projections (2025-2027):

Sales and Revenue: GM's total U.S. vehicle sales were up 8% in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, with growth in both gasoline and electric vehicles. EV sales in the U.S. more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching a record 66,501 units, making GM the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. This surge was partly driven by consumers buying EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30, 2025. GM is expected to see its top line contract by 4% in fiscal year 2025 and another 2% in FY26, reaching approximately $175.47 billion. However, other analyst projections suggest revenue of $178.9 billion in 2025, growing to $190.075 billion in 2026 and $193.1 billion in 2027.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Analysts project GM's EPS to be around $9.85 for 2025, rising to $11.45 in 2026 and $12.25 in 2027. Another projection estimates EPS to descend from multi-year highs of $10.60 in FY24 to $9.44 per share in FY25, before rebounding 2% to $9.66 in FY26.

Production: Global output for GM's wholly-owned brands is anticipated to decrease by about 2.5% in 2025, with a further decline projected for 2026, primarily due to an expected reduction in overall North American demand. Growth is then expected to return in 2027.

Stock Price: Short-term stock price forecasts for GM vary significantly. Some predict an average price of $33.15 in 2025, with a high of $45.08, while others suggest a year-end 2025 price of $68.44 or $67.12. For 2026, predictions range from an average of $56.39 to $76.08 or $80.74.

Long-Term Projections (Beyond 2027):

Revenue and Earnings: GM's outlook for 2028 anticipates $185.3 billion in revenue and $8.0 billion in earnings.

Stock Price: Long-term stock price forecasts show a wide range. For 2028, average predictions span from $44.92 to $120.53. By 2030, forecasts range from an average of $51.39 to $138.32. Further out, some analyses suggest GM's stock could reach an average of $59.71 by 2040 and $81.70 by 2050, while other predictions are more optimistic, reaching $150 by 2034 and $135.72 by 2035.

Decarbonization Targets: GM has set short-term (up to 2027), medium-term (2028-2035), and long-term (2036-2050) greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, covering at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and relevant Scope 3 emissions. The company aims for net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for General Motors is predicated on several key factors:

Favorable Trade Agreements: Progress in trade agreements, such as the one with South Korea, could significantly reduce tariff burdens. Further agreements with Canada and Mexico could provide additional relief, potentially improving GM's cost structure beyond pre-tariff levels.

Strong Free Cash Flow and Capital Returns: GM boasts a substantial 26% free cash flow yield. Analysts anticipate that as macroeconomic uncertainties subside and its financial position stabilizes, GM will resume aggressive capital return strategies, including robust share buyback programs and potentially increased dividend payments.

North American Market Strength: UBS projects GM's North American margins could return to the 8-10% target range in the coming years, surpassing the consensus view.

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity. The company's record Q3 2025 U.S. EV sales, led by models like the Equinox EV (the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S.), demonstrate strong demand for its electric offerings. GM's Ultium battery platform, designed for modularity and flexibility, is central to its EV strategy, aiming to reduce battery costs and make EVs more competitive.

Strategic Production Shifts: GM is making strategic production shifts to mitigate tariff risks, including a $4 billion investment in 2025 to upgrade U.S. assembly plants to boost high-margin production and reduce exposure to tariffs.

Bear Case Scenarios

The bear case for General Motors highlights several significant challenges:

Ongoing Tariff Pressures: Tariffs continue to pose a significant threat to GM's profitability. With nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles assembled outside the country, GM is vulnerable to import tariffs, which could result in an annual impact of approximately $5 billion on its bottom line without mitigation. Reciprocal tariffs could further increase costs, potentially raising total tariffs on some imports to 40% or 50%, leading to higher vehicle prices and reduced sales volumes.

EV Market Headwinds: GM's electrification ambitions have encountered a ""harsh reality check"" due to slowing consumer adoption, the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and inadequate charging infrastructure. GM's EV penetration stood at only 6% of unit sales year-to-date in Q2 2025.

Macroeconomic Uncertainties: General macroeconomic uncertainties could impact GM's financial position and its ability to resume aggressive capital return strategies.

Weak Gross Profit Margin: A relatively weak gross profit margin of 10.97% suggests room for operational improvement, indicating potential vulnerability to cost pressures.

Intense Competition: The EV sector is expected to be fiercely competitive, which may constrain opportunities for margin improvements.

Legal and Political Risks: Some analysts cite potential risks from illegal data harvesting and transmission class action lawsuits, as well as a potentially anti-EV stance from a Trump administration, which could thwart growth efforts.

Potential Strategic Pivots

GM is undertaking several strategic pivots to adapt to the evolving automotive industry:

Reassessment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Strategy: GM is scaling back its investment in the Cruise robotaxi project, moving away from capital-intensive ride-hailing ambitions. Instead, the company is refocusing on personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) by leveraging its existing Super Cruise system, which is available on numerous models and accumulates millions of miles monthly.

Balancing EV and ICE Investments: While committed to EVs, GM has slowed its EV rollout and is reinvesting in internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms, particularly focusing on high-margin V8 trucks and SUVs. This pragmatic approach acknowledges slowing EV consumer adoption and aims to capitalize on profitable traditional vehicle segments.

This unexpectedly has been the case for lithium-ion batteries—a power source for electric vehicles and various portable electronics—where scientists knew what the mechanism was but weren’t sure exactly how it worked.

Fortunately, MIT scientists have found the answer. For a Science paper published October 2, researchers describe a model that illustrates how coupled ion-electron transfer (CIET), a process in which an electron travels to the electrode with an ion, in this case a lithium ion, may explain the life source of a lithium-ion battery. The insight could “guide the design of more powerful and faster charging lithium-ion batteries,” according to the researchers.

A cascade of molecules

A typical lithium-ion battery works via a chemical mechanism called intercalation. Essentially, during battery discharge, lithium ions dissolved in an electrolyte solution insert themselves inside of a solid electrode. When the ions “de-intercalate” and return to the electrolyte, the battery charges.

The rate of intercalation governs everything from a battery’s net power to its charging speed—the reason the researchers found it imperative to better understand the underlying mechanisms, the paper explained.

Previously, scientists believed that lithium intercalation in a battery electrode was driven by a model describing how quickly lithium ions could diffuse between the electrolyte and the electrode. However, actual experiments hadn’t quite matched what that model predicted, suggesting to researchers that there may be another option.

A traveling pair

For the new study, the researchers prepared more than 50 combinations of electrolytes and electrodes to straighten things out once and for all. Like previous experiments, they found sizable inconsistencies between actual data and the model. So instead, the team came up with several alternatives that could explain what they were seeing.

Finally, they decided on a model based on the assumption that a lithium ion could only enter an electrode if it travels with an electron from an electrolyte solution—coupled ion-electron transfer. This electrochemical pairing makes it easier for intercalation to occur, the researchers explained, and the mathematics behind CIET fits the data well.

“The electrochemical step is not lithium insertion, which you might think is the main thing, but it’s actually electron transfer to reduce the solid material that is hosting the lithium,” Martin Bazant, study co-author and a mathematician at MIT, told MIT News. “Lithium is intercalated at the same time that the electron is transferred, and they facilitate one another.”

Not only that, but the researchers also accidentally discovered that switching up the composition of electrolytes influenced intercalation rates. Follow-up investigations could uncover more efficient ways for creating stronger, faster batteries, they explained.

“What we hope is enabled by this work is to get the reactions to be faster and more controlled, which can speed up charging and discharging,” Bazant said.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/lithium-ion-intercalation-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 01:59:34.504190

People are facing skyrocketing costs across the board, from health care, to groceries, to energy bills with Trump and Republicans in complete control over the federal government. Yet instead of working with Democrats to make our lives better, they’ve spent this year unlawfully taking back billions of dollars from communities while giving handouts to billionaires.”

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada Program Director Audrey Peral said, “In Nevada, utility bills have been going up and up over the last couple of years, and we have heard from many families who are having to make tough decisions about which bills to prioritize. Now we are in the midst of a government shutdown and are concerned about how this will hurt our economy even more. Combined with the smart energy programs the White House has either cut or threatened to cut, programs that help low-income families pay their gas and electricity bills or move us to less expensive clean energy – like LIHEAP and Solar for All – we have already been hit hard, and we simply can’t afford this. We firmly believe that under any administration, every family deserves access to clean air, clean energy, and a healthy environment.”

MLCV TAKE: Michigan LCV intern and Western Michigan University graduate student Olivia Gries said, “Trump and Congressional Republicans have made it clear that lowering costs is not in the cards for this budget and they are going to let the government shut down because of that. The Trump administration is forcing outdated and expensive coal plants to remain open while allowing the federal government to shut down. It’s clear where Trump’s priorities are focused. It’s time for Trump and the Republican led Congress to do the job they were elected to do and come to a bipartisan solution to protect their constituents and our environment.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND DIRTY, EXPENSIVE COAL: In another move that will raise people’s energy costs and threaten our health, the Trump administration announced its plans to further subsidize the coal industry with $625 million and open up millions of additional acres of public lands for coal leasing at a discounted rate. This move prioritizes Big Polluters by advancing dirty, expensive energy that will drive up costs and further harm our environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy and former EPA scientist Matthew Davis said, “Even as energy prices are skyrocketing because of Trump administration policies, today they are again prioritizing Big Polluters over hardworking families. Clean energy is simply the cheapest and fastest energy to bring online so we can all have lower costs and cleaner air and water. Meanwhile, energy analysts have found that ‘99 percent of existing U.S. coal plants are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.’ Yet the Trump administration is determined to help the coal barons who have seen their fortunes wane as wind, solar and batteries deliver cheaper, cleaner electricity for families across the country.

“The Trump administration is also using extreme measures to force coal-fired power plants to stay open, as they are doing with the Campbell plant in Michigan–these actions are already raising electric bills for families and making our air and water dirtier. If the Trump administration actually cared about mine workers, they would be taking steps to protect their health like finalizing life-saving silica dust standards–not delaying them. By proposing to sell off 13 million acres of our public lands to Dirty Coal, the Trump administration is more than tripling what was passed as part of the Big Ugly Bill’s giveaway to fossil fuel, while lowering their royalty rate so coal companies pay less for the resources that belong to all of us. The Trump administration’s attempts to ban clean energy and prop up dirty and costly coal will not only cause costs to keep going up, but will also risk the health of our communities and threaten public lands that belong to all of us.”

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CANCELS $8 BILLION FOR ENERGY PROJECTS IN BLUE STATES: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and OMB Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in clean energy investments in 16 blue states. These politically targeted cuts will raise costs, eliminate jobs, and slash clean, affordable energy generation.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “President Trump and Russell Vought’s latest massive cuts to hundreds of energy projects in politically targeted states is a blatant example of corruption that will raise costs for households and businesses. At a time when energy demand is increasing, costs are already rising, and job losses are mounting, Trump and Republicans in Congress should be focused on funding and deploying the cheapest and fastest energy sources–clean energy– not gutting or banning them.

“Since he took office, Trump has unleashed an all-out attack on clean energy as part of a deliberate plan to benefit his friends in the oil, gas, and coal industries– at our expense. Republicans in Congress are trying to say that they can’t control what the White House does during the government shutdown, but that only further proves the point that the Trump administration is lawless and out of control and it’s the people of this country who are going to suffer. Congressional Republicans must get serious about working with Democrats on bipartisan bills to fund the government, lower costs, get people back to work, and protect communities, families, and our environment.”

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

REPUBLICANS SHUT DOWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: After refusing to work with Democrats to produce a bipartisan bill to keep families’ costs down and fund the government, Congressional Republicans and President Trump have shut down the federal government. As Trump continues to gut critical federal programs, it is essential for Republicans to work with Democrats to negotiate a spending bill that protects our communities and environment and lowers costs.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “Trump and Republicans need to stop gutting essential services that make life safer, healthier, and cheaper, and instead work together on bipartisan solutions to address the affordability crisis they’ve created. People are facing skyrocketing costs across the board, from health care, to groceries, to energy bills with Trump and Republicans in complete control over the federal government. Yet instead of working with Democrats to make our lives better, they’ve spent this year unlawfully taking back billions of dollars from communities while giving handouts to billionaires.

“As energy demand soars, they’re trying to take away our affordable clean energy choices and good-paying jobs and instead spend taxpayer dollars on more expensive, slow, and dirty fossil fuels. It’s time for Trump and Republicans to get serious about working with Democrats on bipartisan bills to fund the government, get people back to work, and protect communities, families, and our environment.”

LCVAF ANNOUNCES SLATE OF ENDORSEMENTS FOR U.S. SENATE: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, which works to elect candidates who will fight to build a clean energy economy and strengthen our democracy for all, announced new endorsements of seven climate champion U.S. senators for re-election next year. The endorsements include Senators Cory Booker (NJ), Chris Coons (DE), John Hickenlooper (CO), Ed Markey (MA), Jeff Merkley (OR), Ben Ray Luján (NM), and Jack Reed (RI).

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “As Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress continuously and outrageously deny science, spread lies about climate change and clean energy, and disregard democratic norms, people across our country are suffering in the face of rising energy costs, more extreme weather disasters, and increasing attacks on our fundamental rights every day. That is why we need to re-elect these strong champions to the U.S. Senate who are fighting tirelessly for our planet and our democracy, and why we need to restore a pro-climate majority in the Senate. It’s never been more important to elect representatives who will protect people while Trump and extreme Republicans in Congress shut down the government unless they gut critical funding to line the pockets of their Big Polluter and corporate donors. We’re all-in to support these Senators to take back Congress next year and fight for our communities and our future generations.”

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.","The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states.

Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.

The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.

But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration.

In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.

In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”

Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”

Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023.

Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.

Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too

A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million.

The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.

Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.

The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department.

Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt

The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.

Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.

“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs.

Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.

There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy.

Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.

“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.

New Mexico lawmakers concluded a two-day special legislative session on Thursday, where they shored up state food assistance and health care programs amid looming cuts in federal funding and spiking health insurance premiums.

The New Mexico Senate adjourned Sine die shortly after noon, and the New Mexico House of Representatives at 5:15 p.m. following passage of a $162 million spending package and four other bills. Lujan Grisham’s office

By Friday night, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed four of those bills. She was still reviewing an additional bill expanding state authority to set vaccine policy independent of federal guidelines.

“This special session was about protecting New Mexico families from real and immediate harms that endanger their ability to access healthcare and put food on their tables. Here in New Mexico, we step up to take care of one another, and I’m proud to say that’s what we did for families across our state in this special session,” House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) said in a press release issued after the session concluded.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also applauded the action taken by the Legislature and, in a press release, vowed to sign the bills. The rapid speed at which the proposals moved through the legislative process stood in contrast to last year’s special session called by the governor to address public safety, which ended after a few hours and saw no movement on priorities set by the governor.

Democrats said repeatedly that the special session was crucial to insulate New Mexico from a barrage of federal funding reductions and sweeping policy changes, especially to the state’s Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Health Care Authority estimates that 16,200 New Mexicans could lose SNAP benefits because of their immigration status, and that another 20,070 would become ineligible to continue receiving benefits because of new work requirements. They also estimate that at least 88,500 New Mexicans will permanently lose their benefits.

Senate Majority Floor Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) argued that, given years of surpluses and with $3 billion in reserves, New Mexico is in a strong position to counter some of those effects.

“Well, there is no way we can fully offset the loss of federal funds. Thankfully, our state is in a position to help New Mexicans mitigate the impact of these federal cuts, and that is what we’re doing here in this special session,” Wirth said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.

Republicans disagreed, arguing that many of the changes in the Reconciliation Bill will not take effect for months if not years, and that matters on the agenda could easily be addressed in the 30-day regular session in January.

“This special session just isn’t that special, and certainly I believe it’s wildly premature. We’re going to address some issues here based on the possibility that something might happen that’s not happening,” Senate Minority Floor Leader William Sharer (R-Farmington) said.

Spending

House Bill 1, a $161 million package in one-time spending for Medicaid, food assistance, public broadcasting, rural hospitals, and tax credits for individuals who buy insurance on state exchanges. Some $120 million in unspent money was transferred from the Healthcare Authority to cover the price tag. It also contains $100,000 for the New Mexico Department of Licensing and Regulation for interstate medical licensure compacts.

The package also contained $5.6 million in funding for public radio and education television, as well as $430,000 for educational television and public radio associated with Indian tribes and pueblos. The money comes after Congress approved and Trump signed a rescission package that canceled federal funding for public media.

Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund

Legislation, known as Senate Bill 1, which would make tweaks to the Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund, cleared the House and Senate.

Senate Bill 1 will allow practitioners and facilities eligible to receive grants from the fund to spend that money for operational costs. Previously, the money could only be used for health care start-ups or expansions of existing facilities. The measure also revised the criteria for eligibility from counties with populations or less to counties designated as high-needs geographic health professional shortage areas by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. House Bill 1 also directed $50 million to the Fund.

Backers of the bill said the adjustments were needed to address the dearth of healthcare in rural areas and allow hospitals that are projected to see revenue losses due to decreases in Medicaid and provider taxes.

Tax credits

Discussion over Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, which have been a sticking point in the government shutdown in Washington, D.C, were also on the minds of lawmakers in the Roundhouse.

The subsidies that were enacted in 2021 during the pandemic and renewed with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to sunset at the end of the year. The subsidies expanded existing tax credits for those who buy health insurance on exchanges to individuals and households making 400% or more of the Federal Poverty Level. According to the Health Care Authority, failure to extend the federal credits would cause between 15,300 and 27,100 New Mexicans to lose coverage.

Lawmakers during the session approved House Bill 2, legislation which allows people making above 400% of the federal poverty level and rely on the Exchange for health insurance coverage, to maintain eligibility for assistance from the state’s Healthcare Affordability Fund thereby allowing New Mexicans with incomes above that threshold to qualify for that aid to keep New Mexicans who depend on the lapsing federal credits from losing coverage. Senate Bill 1 also appropriated $17.3 million for the bill.

Criminal competency

Lawmakers also passed a fix to the state’s criminal competency code that will enable the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to maintain jurisdiction in cases where defendants accused of misdemeanor offenses can be tried if they are found competent to stand trial.

Vaccines

Members of the Legislature also approved a bill that allows the state more flexibility in determining its own vaccine standards. House Democratic Majority Leader Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) previously told NM Poltical Report that changes to federal vaccine policy were causing alarms with state officials’ concerns about public health.

Here in New York, more than 1,000 rabbis and Jewish peace activists led a protest Thursday demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. arms transfers to Israel. They gathered at Brooklyn Borough Hall for a mass public memorial service on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, known as the Day of Atonement. Nearly 60 people were arrested as they nonviolently blocked traffic to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is New York City comptroller — and ally of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — Brad Lander.

Brad Lander: “We must today take collective responsibility for what the Israeli government has been doing, is doing today, on Yom Kippur, says, makes clear it is going to keep doing to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank also, the bombs funded by our taxpayer dollars in the name of the Jewish state, but a desecration of Judaism.”

President Trump has embraced the government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to punish his political opponents while slashing the federal workforce and cutting off funding to whole government agencies. On Thursday, Trump said budget chief Russell Vought will have the power to decide if cuts should be “temporary or permanent.” And he said he would continue to target projects and agencies favored by Democrats.

President Donald Trump: “Well, there could be firings, and that’s their fault. And it could also be other things. I mean, we could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

Democrats are demanding the reversal of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that will result in some 15 million people losing their health insurance coverage over the next decade. This is House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “This is day two of Donald Trump’s shutdown, but it is day 256 of the chaos that the Trump presidency has unleashed on the American people. Republicans have shut the government down because they don’t want to provide healthcare to working-class Americans.”

Meanwhile, the Labor Department will delay publication of its monthly jobs report that was scheduled for release today. It was expected to show a slowdown in hiring in September. Economist Erica Groshen, who formerly led the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told The Washington Post, “It’s a bad time to be missing data. We are flying blind right as the economy could be turning.”

In California, a massive explosion tore through a Chevron oil refinery in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo Thursday evening, sparking a fire that burned through the night and could be seen from miles away. The explosion occurred around 9:30 p.m. and prompted shelter-in-place orders until 2 a.m. No injuries have been reported. This comes as the Trump administration has moved to shut down the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency tasked with uncovering the causes of industrial disasters.

The Trump administration is asking nine public and private universities to sign a deal to help promote conservative ideas on campus in exchange for federal funding. The administration is calling it a 10-point “compact” and promised “substantial and meaningful federal grants” if universities take action against academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

The Trump administration is also demanding that the universities ban the use of race or sex in hiring or admissions and cap foreign students to 15% of undergraduates. Walt Heinecke, a faculty member at the University of Virginia, one of the universities targeted by the Trump administration, warned that the memo threatens academic freedom.

Walt Heinecke: “It’s a threat. And it’s a threat that should be taken seriously and should be reacted to in a way in which I think all colleges and universities who this is — this is meant to actually be applied later to all universities and colleges, not just to the nine or 10 that have received the letter. So, that means that we should all be thinking about how to resist this particular form of intrusion.”

On Thursday California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned administrators against signing trump’s 10-point “compact.” Newsom wrote on social media, “If any California university signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding—including Cal Grants—instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”

In Baltimore, a federal immigration judge has denied a bid for asylum by Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia — though Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal the ruling. The judge dismissed Abrego Garcia’s argument that he faced “imminent removal to Uganda,” even though the Trump administration has repeatedly, publicly threatened to send him to Uganda or Eswatini, countries he has no ties to. Abrego Garcia first made international headlines when he was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where he was held in the notorious CECOT mega-prison.

An ICE official later admitted his deportation was an “administrative error.” He’s since faced relentless attacks on his character by President Trump and top administration officials, who’ve accused him of being a human smuggler and a member of the MS-13 gang, even though he’s not been convicted of any crimes.

A federal court in Georgia has denied an emergency request by the award-winning Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to remain in the United States, paving the way for his deportation to El Salvador today. According to the ACLU, Guevara was not allowed to say goodbye to his wife and three children. Guevara has lived in the United States for some 20 years and has built a large following for his reporting on anti-ICE protests. He was jailed by ICE for more than 100 days, even though an immigration judge granted him bond. He was arrested in June while live-streaming a “No Kings” demonstration, even though he clearly identified himself as a journalist. We’ll have more on his case after headlines.

President Trump is declaring that the U.S. is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, following recent strikes on boats in the Caribbean — that’s according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. The memo also states, “The United States has now reached a critical point where we must use force in self-defense and defense of others against the ongoing attacks by these designated terrorist organizations.” It comes after the U.S. attacked three boats in the Caribbean last month, reportedly killing 17 people. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino blasted the U.S. Thursday after detecting five F-35 fighter jets close to the Venezuelan coast.

Vladimir Padrino López: “The presence of these aircraft flying near our area of influence, nearby the Caribbean Sea and off the Venezuelan coast, is a vulgarity and a threat to national security. It is a serious threat. So I denounce before the world the military harassment and the military threat from the United States government against the people of Venezuela, who only want peace, work and happiness.”

The United Nations is calling for urgent action to prevent large-scale, ethnically driven atrocities in El Fasher, the besieged capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state. On Thursday, the U.N.’s top human rights official warned at least 91 civilians were killed in El Fasher last month, as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, carried out artillery shelling, drone strikes and ground incursions. The U.N. also warned the RSF against starving civilians in El Fasher as a method of warfare, amid credible reports of civilians being tortured and killed by RSF fighters for bringing food and essential supplies into the city.

British police have identified the suspect who drove a car at members of the public outside a Manchester synagogue on Thursday before attacking people with a knife. Thirty-five-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie was a British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by firearms officers just minutes after the rampage began. Manchester police report one of the two victims killed in the attack was hit by police gunfire, and one of the three people hospitalized was struck by a bullet fired by police.

This year’s U-turn in federal energy policy aside, it is not possible to stop the march of renewable energy innovation in the US, as amply illustrated by the latest iteration of the North American Agrivoltaics Awards program. The NAAA program is yet another sign that the agrivoltaic movement is transitioning from a patchwork of demonstration projects into a full fledged job-creating, farm-saving machine poised for widespread adoption, helping to sustain the nation’s agriculture industry through challenging times while adding more clean kilowatts to the electricity grid.

Agrivoltaics & The Solar Farm Summit

CleanTechnica has spilled plenty of ink on the emerging agrivoltaic side of the solar industry. Also called solar farming, agri-solar, agri-pv, and dual-use, the general idea is to provide room for farming activities in and around solar arrays. Meanwhile, farmers gain revenue by leasing their land to solar developers, or they can install their own solar panels to offset their electricity bills.

The movement has also birthed the ecovoltaics field, which focuses on native habitat restoration within solar arrays. Farms can host both agrivoltaic and ecovoltaic operations, such as pollinator habitats that benefit crop production and provide for soil restoration.

A growing network of supporting organizations demonstrates that the agrivoltaic movement has matured into an emerging industry over the years, with the annual Solar Farm Summit being one example. This year’s event took place in Chicago in August, focusing on the use of agrivoltaics to add an interlocking “stack” of value to farm operations, including ecosystem services and land conservation alongside energy generation and crop production.

Among other activities, the event hosted the North American Agrivoltaics Awards program, aimed at showcasing innovative projects that address regional challenges, climate change, food deserts, and other factors impacting farmers and their communities.

Agrivoltaic Award Winners Of 2025

The 2025 NAAA program included a Solar Farm of the Year award, shared jointly by Rutgers University in New Jersey and the Spaces of Opportunity community farm in South Phoenix, Arizona, to highlight the application of agrivoltaics across large institutions and small grassroots organizations alike.

With its “Farmers First” focus on productivity and profitability, Rutgers has earned widespread support for agrivoltaics within the New Jersey agriculture industry, including the state’s Highlands and Pinelands heritage and preservation regions. “Rutgers operates three research farms across New Jersey to study how solar can support crops and livestock without displacing them. From vegetables and hay to goats and cattle, the sites simulate real farm conditions and guide statewide policy,” NAAA explains, noting that the Rutgers program also supports New Jersey’s newly launched Dual-Use Solar Pilot Program.

The Rutgers effort builds on the state’s role as an early adopter of solar energy. New Jersey emerged as the #1 state for installed solar capacity in the early 2000’s and it currently holds the #12 slot for installed capacity, a respectable achievement for one of the nation’s smaller states by land area.

“New Jersey farmers have for the past several decades been actively integrating renewable energy into their operations as a way of reducing energy expenses, establishing additional income streams by selling solar-generated electricity back into the grid, and lowering their farms’ impact on climate change,” explains New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Edward D. Wengryn in a write-up posted by Rutgers.

A Girl Scout Gold Award Community Farm Project

The Spaces of Opportunity project demonstrates how agrivoltaics can help community organizations alleviate local food deserts, even in regions not particularly conducive to farming. The farm, which also earned a Girl Scout Gold Award, deploys its solar panels to buffer hundreds of transplants from harsh growing conditions. The produce is donated to schools, food banks, farmers markets, and other local organizations.

“What makes this agrivoltaics project exceptional is its combination of real-world application, scientific research, and educational value,” NAAA explains. “The team is collaborating with the USDA Arid Land Research Center to monitor plant yields, temperature impact, and other environmental benefits.”

“The data collected here will support a peer-reviewed paper and help farmers across the Southwest adopt climate-smart agriculture,” NAAA adds, taking note of a similar project called Gardens of Tomorrow. “Both installations offer tangible proof that solar and agriculture can work together, even in some of the hottest, most challenging urban growing environments in the country,” the organization emphasizes.

Everybody Loves Agrivoltaics

Rutgers and Spaces of Opportunity went up against some stiff competition this year. The other nominees were:

Colorado State University, a low-maintenance, durable system of bifacial solar fence arrays enabling row crop production (specifically, corn) applicable to diverse regions around the US.

Lettuce Shine, Oregon, a first-in-the-state agrivoltaic microgrid in a region with hot, dry summers that are getting hotter and drier alongside climate change, focusing on lettuce, spinach, and other heat-sensitive crops.

Madison Fields Solar Project, Ohio, the first agrivoltaic operation constructed by the leading solar developer Savion, which has partnered with the Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences for crop testing as well as soil health monitoring, and trialing precision agriculture practices. The project also supports Savion’s “Between the Rows” initiative enabling utility-scale solar farms to create new opportunities for farmers.

Native Hill Farms Mobile Agrivoltaic Array, Colorado, a mobile, bifacial solar array that integrates seamlessly with the farm’s mobile greenhouse operation. The greenhouses move along tracks to enable cover cropping and other soil-based regenerative practices to take place on a rotating basis, while extending the growing season.

Ring Road Agrivoltaics Project, Massachusetts, a solar array over a cranberry bog that demonstrates how agrivoltaics can integrate with highly specialized heritage agricultural operations. The elevated panels help conserve soil moisture and shield the crop from heat stress while adding a new power generation resource to the electricity grid.

But Wait, There’s More

The 2025 NAAA program also opens a window into forthcoming agrivoltaic innovations in the US, with a “Solar Plan of the Year” award category covering the entire field of dual-use operations, meaning agrivoltaics, ecovoltaics, or both. With additional notes provided by NAAA, the 2025 finalists were:

Community Farm at Roundabout Meadows, Virginia: A small-scale, “yet deeply strategic installation that could have statewide ripple effects,” the project aims to identify shade-tolerant food crops with widespread application across diverse sites including rooftops, helping to launch agrivoltaic activity in the state beyond its current focus on grazing and pollinator habitats.

Denver Botanic Gardens, Colorado: This working farm hosts a 1.2-megawatt solar array shading vegetable crops, funded through Denver’s climate sales tax. When fully up and running the farm is expected to benefit income-qualified residents with up to 30,000 pounds of vegetables per year and discounted utility bills.

City of Detroit, Michigan: In a joint effort with the firm Lightstar, Detroit has introduced a multi-site urban farm project supported by agrivoltaic elements that decarbonize municipal buildings while enabling local communities to grow lettuce, kale, carrots, and berries among other crops. The program includes energy efficiency upgrades for local residents (see more details here).

The Plains Road Project, New York: Another Lightstar project, this 3.2 megawatt community solar project was enabled by an update to zoning laws, requiring dual-use projects to submit a farm plan. “This shift didn’t just pave the way for the Plains Road Project—it opened the door for other dual-use efforts in the region.” The zoning application included a 32-page farm plan developed by the firm Sol Ag Services.

UW Madison-Kegonsa Research Campus, Wisconsin: This “BadgerVoltaics” collaboration with Alliant Energy involves more than 130 faculty, staff, and students in dual-use research including both pollinator preservation and food production.

Washington State University Institute for Northwest Energy Futures: A $2.4 million grant from the state’s Department of Commerce supports this project in partnership with the European firm Sun’Agri. “INEF is addressing key challenges faced by orchardists—such as summer sunburn damage that can affect up to 50% of the fruit—while providing power for agricultural operations like irrigation and frost management…This demonstration site highlights the potential of agrivoltaics to reshape Washington’s apple industry, which accounts for 35% of U.S. domestic apple sales and spans over 50,000 acres.”

Next Steps For Farm Preservation In The US, Or Not

Against the backdrop of all this farmer-supporting agrivoltaic activity, a lot of bleating and braying over the wonders of coal has been heard from the Trump administration. It’s not clear how domestic coal producers can help US farmers, who are hanging by a thread, battered by the president’s tariff wars, inflation, worker shortages, extreme weather, and the shredding of financial assistance for clean energy projects.

On top of all that, this week has seen an abrupt halt to the basic Agriculture Department services upon which many farmers depend, a situation that will persist until the Republican majority in Congress decides to set the wheels of the US government in motion again. After all, they do hold the majority, with all the privileges, powers, and responsibilities conferred upon that status under our system of government.

It’s a partnership between several University departments: UNCG Parking Operations and Campus Access Management, Campus Enterprises, Housing & Residential Life, and the UNCG Green Fund administered by the Office of Sustainability.

They can be found on Grey Drive near Coit Hall and in Spartan Village near the Lofts on Lee.

The outdoor charging stations, manufactured and installed by EnerFusion, are completely self-contained, powered only by sunlight, and exist entirely off the electrical grid. They will provide lockable storage for up to four e-bikes, e-scooters, e-skateboards, or e-hoverboards at a time, with ambient lighting activated after sunset. Users need to provide their own locks and charging cables. It should take approximately two hours to charge the average e-bike battery.

EnerFusion specializes in sustainable, green charging stations and outdoor furniture for public spaces. The University previously worked with the company in 2023, when Middle College student Neil Kapileshwariu spearheaded the addition of their solar-powered picnic tables outside Moran Commons, also underwritten by the Green Fund.

“For safety reasons, we do not allow people to charge their electric vehicles inside campus buildings” says Sean MacInnes, sustainability specialist at the University. “We had great success with the solar-powered picnic tables and are thankful to EnerFusion for helping us with another sustainable solution that will help us meet a growing student need.”

Micromobility conveyances, such as scooters, e-bikes, and hoverboards, are increasingly popular among UNCG students. Eco-friendly bikes and scooters have been available for short-term rental on campus since April 2024 through the Bird company, with discounts on hourly rates available for students.

“Students and employees can get a discount if they register with their UNCG email,” MacInnes says. “Students who are Pell Grant eligible can get a deeper discount. More information is available on the POCAM website.”

The charging stations underscore UNCG’s commitment to sustainability, and the imperative to provide for the needs and preferences of its students.

The Green Fund, created in 2016 by the Student Government Association and supported by student activity fees, operates as a campus-based grant program to help meet the goals of UNCG’s sustainability mission. Through the Green Fund, students have invested more than $500,000 in various sustainability projects that have supported education, research, and professional development opportunities for students, and which will save UNCG $76,000 over the lifetime (nine years) of various energy efficiency projects.",https://www.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enerfusion-charging-station-337164-F.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 06:59:06.377980

Instead, they’re putting together their own incentives. BMW has stepped in with one of the most direct responses so far, offering a $7,500 purchase credit across its lineup, and in some ways the deal is more straightforward than the federal program ever was.

Read: BMW Exec Says “Combustion Engines Will Never Disappear. Never!”

BMW says the incentive applies across its full EV lineup, from the $57,900 i4 to the $169,675 i7 M70. Unlike the now-defunct federal credit, this deal doesn’t hinge on income caps or complicated tax liability math; it’s a straight MSRP discount at the time of purchase.

More Than Just a Credit

The move makes BMW one of the first luxury brands to replace the credit in full, and it’s not stopping there. According to AutoBlog, buyers also get access to 2.99% financing for up to 60 months. Returning or “loyalty” customers can also get up to $5,000 extra, with the biggest rewards reserved for buyers of the equally big i7.

For some shoppers, that structure makes BMW’s plan more useful than the federal version ever was. The tax credit never helped customers who didn’t owe $7,500 in taxes, and it locked out high-income buyers and expensive models. BMW’s deal skips the fine print and extends the benefit to anyone financing through its system.

Following a Familiar Formula

While BMW stands out in the luxury field, it’s far from the first automaker to go down a similar road. Hyundai slashed sticker prices on the Ioniq 5 in recent days.

With a capacity of 150 megawatts (MW) direct current, combined with a 75 MW alternating current battery energy storage system operating over four hours, the facility will supply electricity to the local grid under a 20-year power purchase agreement.

An infrastructure designed for demand management

The Milagro Solar+Storage project captures solar energy generated during peak sunlight hours and releases it on demand through battery storage. This setup helps meet increasing electricity needs during high-demand periods while improving grid stability. The infrastructure is built to mitigate curtailment, manage evening ramp-ups, and optimise the balance between generation and usage.

A large-scale project with local impact

The construction phase engaged around 200 workers at its peak, including 100 New Mexico residents. Blattner Energy, the contractor responsible for delivering the project, installed 282,000 solar panels, totalling 300,000 work hours with no recorded safety incidents. Over its operational lifetime, the project is expected to generate approximately $18mn in tax revenue for the county and its school districts, supported by the Industrial Revenue Bond mechanism.

Strategic regional development

The Milagro launch follows the commissioning, in March 2025, of a separate 10 MW solar plant in San Elizario, Texas, under the Texas Community Solar Program. Both projects form part of El Paso Electric’s broader regional strategy to enhance network resilience amid growing electricity demand across the southern United States.

Economic and energy benefits for 60,000 households

According to the project’s developers, Milagro is expected to provide reliable energy for approximately 60,000 average New Mexico households.

Atlas Agro, which has plans to construct a $1.3 billion plant near the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, was set to receive federal funds via the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub.

This week, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was terminating 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, collectively worth $7.56 billion, including a little more than $1 billion for the Northwest hydrogen hub.

The cuts affect six projects in Washington, eastern Oregon and Montana, including Atlas Agro.

In March 2023, Atlas entered a $9 million agreement to purchase 50 acres from the Port of Benton for a project that swelled in value to $1.3 billion. It remains the largest economic development deal in recent history.

$20M tax break from city

Atlas Agro was warmly embraced by politicians and by the city of Richland.

The city’s elected council awarded Atlas Agro $20 million in property tax breaks under Washington’s Targeted Urban Area program for new investment that generates jobs. Atlas is expected to employ 158 once the project is built and more during construction.

If built, Atlas Agro will use city water and vast amounts of electricity from an unidentified source to produce hydrogen for calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer for local agriculture. The project is also referred to as Pacific Green Fertilizer.

While it was initially billed as a carbon-free product that supported state and federal climate goals, officials acknowledged the priorities changed when Trump won a second term last fall. They hoped the plant’s “American-made fertilizer for American farmers” message would strike a note with the incoming leaders.

Neither Atlas Agro nor local economic development officials could be reached to comment on the status of the project.

U.S. Sen Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said stripping funds from the hydrogen hub will eliminate the potential for more than 10,000 jobs in the region.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt,” she said. She pledged to fight the cuts,

‘Not economically viable’

DOE said the termination of the funding came after a review that showed “projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Recipients have 30 days to appeal the termination decision.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson condemned the termination of more than $1.1 billion in funding for projects in the state, chiefly the hydrogen hub.

“The attack on these funds impacts almost entirely Democratic-led states,” he noted. Ferguson pledged to fight what he called an illegal action.

Blue state, red counties

The cuts affected blue states, but the pain is being felt in red counties.

Donald Trump handily won voter support in Benton and Franklin counties in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, typically with 55%-59% of the vote.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is a collection of projects meant to inspire investment in alternatives to fossil fuels. DOE approved it as one of a handful of such hubs in 2023, following a competitive process.

The $1 billion in federal dollars was expected to spark more than $5 billion in local investment in projects like the fertilizer plant in Richland.

In addition to Atlas Agro, the hub partners are Alare Renewables in Ferndale ($102.8 million), Northwest Seaport Alliance in Seattle and Tacoma ($11.8 million), Lewis County Transit in Chehalis ($36.4 million), Air Liquide in Boardman, Ore., Express Ranch Hydrogen in Baker City, Ore., and St. Regis Solar Hydrogen in St. Regis, Montana. The hub released a statement that it is disappointed by the decision to cut funding but will continue its work.

“There is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started,” it said. “The future of hydrogen is still being written by states, communities, and industries across the country. With or without federal support, this industry will continue to drive the innovation and infrastructure needed to fortify America’s energy economy.” The cuts affect non-hub projects across the state too: They include Nippon Dynawave in Cowlitz County ($46.6 million), PACCAR Inc. in Skagit County (two projects totaling $68 million), CleanFiber Inc. in Lewis County ($10 million), Spokane Edo LLC ($5.3 million), SilFab Solar WA Inc. in Skagit County ($3 million), Washington State University (four Whitman County projects totaling $9.8 million).

Money, power

Atlas Agro made its land deal for Richland in 2023 but has not finalized plans to move ahead with the project.

In addition to funding challenges, it faces a monumental task of securing the 300 or more megawatts it will need. That’s enough to power Richland three times over.

It has mentioned new nuclear as a source but no deals have been announced.

It’s unclear how much power the nearby Boardman project would need.

The Bonneville Power Administration has a 10 megawatt cap for new large users for its best Tier 1 rates.

LITTLETON, Colorado, Oct 3 (Reuters) – Although overshadowed so far by booming data center demand and the U.S. government’s gutting of clean energy policies, California’s rapid scaling of solar farms and battery systems may yet emerge as 2025’s most significant power story.

California’s mammoth solar farms have generated more electricity than the state’s fossil fuel power plants for a record-long stretch so far in 2025, setting a new marker for energy transition progress in the United States.

Topped up by batteries charged by excess solar output in the middle of the day, the swell in California’s solar-powered electricity supplies has triggered the state’s largest-ever year-over-year drop in fossil fuel-fired power output.

California’s electricity output from solar power vs fossil fuels

Even after years of historic growth, the jumps in California’s solar and battery system output are remarkable, and will likely act as blueprints for power roadmaps in other states even as U.S. federal lawmakers scrap support for clean energy.

CLEAN PUSH

California’s electricity supplies from solar farms during January to July jumped by 15% from the same months in 2024 to a record 54,709 gigawatt hours (GWh), Ember data shows.

That year-over-year jump of roughly 7,200 GWh of solar electricity supplies was supplemented by a roughly 75% rise in California’s battery storage capacity, according to LSEG, and allowed utilities to slash fossil fuel-fired generation by 21%.

In terms of the share of California’s electricity generation mix, solar farms accounted for a record 39% of total utility-supplied generation during January to July, up from 33% during the same period in 2024.

For comparison, the state of Texas, which has the second-largest solar power footprint in the U.S., secured 10.4% of its electricity from solar farms so far this year.

California’s electricity output from solar power vs fossil fuels during January to July

As the solar share of California’s electricity mix has climbed, the electricity generation share from fossil fuels has steadily fallen and hit new lows of just 26% so far in 2025.

That compares to a national average fossil fuel share of 55% so far in 2025, and cements California’s position as by far the leading state in terms of clean electricity deployment.

CRITICAL MASS

California’s utilities have rapidly built out capacity of battery storage systems alongside solar power output since 2022, so that the state’s abundant solar power can be deployed to maximum effect.

In previous years, California’s power system was frequently overrun by the massive solar output levels generated during the middle of the day, which was when solar output peaked just as total state power consumption neared its daily lows.

Thanks to a nearly threefold rise in battery storage capacity since 2022 to more than 14,000 megawatts (MW), according to data portal Cleanview, California’s utilities can now store some of that excess solar output and deploy it when demand peaks.

FOSSIL FALLS

The growing scale of California’s solar plus battery networks is allowing utilities to scale back fossil fuel reliance at an unprecedented pace.

Historically, California’s use of fossil fuels peaked during the summer when use of power-hungry air conditioners is highest.

Thanks to rapidly rising solar and battery capacity, however, California’s utilities have been able to make major cuts to fossil fuel deployment even during peak demand periods.

California’s seasonal electricity output from solar power vs fossil fuels

In July 2025, total fossil fuel electricity output was just 36,416 GWh, according to Ember.

That total marked a 40% plunge from July 2024, and was 36% below the July average from 2019 through 2024.

Such a steep drop in fossil generation had a commensurate impact on associated emissions, which in July 2025 were 2.1 million metric tons of CO2 less than in July 2024, and by far the lowest for that month on record.

PRICED IN?

Following the years-long retooling of California’s power system in favour of clean energy over fossil fuels, the state’s electricity costs are starting to reflect the hefty impact of solar power within its generation mix.

While still sharply above the national average, California’s electricity costs have climbed by less than the national average so far this year, posting a 1% rise compared to a 3.3% rise nationally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Going forward, the price-depressing impact of the hefty share of solar power within California’s generation system is expected to act as a drag on overall electricity costs, even as power bills are expected to keep climbing elsewhere.

California’s high levels of solar radiation and abundant areas of sparsely populated desert also mean the state is better positioned than most to deploy solar farms at massive scale.

Even so, several other U.S. states across the South and Southwest can expect similar cuts to fossil fuel reliance if they also rolled out large solar and battery systems.

And with supplies of solar and battery systems steadily rising just as system costs steadily decline, state utilities that can pull the trigger on expansions to solar and battery systems can expect quick returns on their investments.

At the same time, with benchmark U.S. natural gas prices this year averaging around 37% more than 2024’s levels, according to LSEG, states that can cut use of natural gas can expect significant savings in their fossil fuel purchase bills.

Few other states can match the scale of California’s solar and battery networks, but those that are looking to cut back on fossil fuel dependence and boost output of clean, home-grown power will use the Golden State as a guide.

But the state is set to face further delays in tapping into a key pool of federal grant money, and may not be able to address administrative issues because of furloughs at the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development.

Renew N.C., the program to repair and build single-family homes in western North Carolina, will “continue as normal for the near term,” confirmed David Rhoades, spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Commerce. The program, still largely in the planning phase, is currently relying on state dollars allocated by the legislature and contingency plans from HUD.

However, the state will not be able to draw down money from the $1.4 billion pool of federal grant money that will pay for the vast majority of the actual rebuilding effort. And any progress on administrative requirements will be put on pause.

“We hope the issues at the federal level will be resolved quickly so the people in western North Carolina needing housing recovery assistance can receive it without delay,” Rhoades said in a statement.

According to HUD’s contingency plan for the shutdown, review and approval of plans and amendments for that specific pool of money will continue. But those operations could face significant delays: 71% of workers at HUD are currently furloughed — on leave without pay — according to the New York Times.

Helene recovery operations at FEMA “will not be impacted” by the shutdown, Gov. Josh Stein said Wednesday. But his administration has requested the Office of Management and Budget to exempt all Helene-related action across federal agencies, as reported by the Asheville Citizen-Times. OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment; a White House automatic email reply said staffing shortages due to the shutdown would delay response.

The shift to a low-carbon economy represents an historic economic opportunity for Canada. The potential job growth from decarbonizing our traditional economy and creating new low-carbon industries is significant. The Royal Bank of Canada estimates that the shift to net-zero emissions could create up to 400,000 new jobs in Canada by the end of this decade alone.1

Through its Sustainable Jobs approach, the Government of Canada is putting people at the heart of its efforts to ensure Canadians – from workers and their communities to Indigenous Peoples and business owners – have the tools and supports they need to thrive in a net-zero future.

Canada is well-positioned to be a leader in the global low-carbon economy. For example, recent data indicates that Canadian exports of clean technology reached $17.9 billion in 2021,Footnote 2 marking a $3.2 billion increase from the year prior.

Canada’s emissions reduction plan for 2030 and its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 will create a wealth of new opportunities in a variety of vital sectors including:

Critical minerals and processing

Electricity

Electric vehicles and battery manufacturing

Renewable energy

Biofuels

Hydrogen

Nuclear

Sustainable forest products

Low-carbon buildings

Carbon capture, utilization and storage

Agriculture

With a highly skilled workforce; abundant energy and natural resources; and innovative industries, Canada can be a supplier of choice – in everything from clean technology, critical minerals, and sustainable forest products to renewable energy and clean fuels – while delivering good, well-paying, sustainable jobs for Canadians in every sector of the economy and every region of the country. The keys to our success must include collaboration and inclusion. That is why the Government’s approach to sustainable jobs puts Canadian workers and their communities at the centre, through meaningful engagement and consultation, to ensure that all Canadians can contribute to and participate in the low-carbon economy.

Daniel Boycott was absolutely loving the 2022 Tesla Model 3 he bought from a used car dealership in September, until he pulled up to a Tesla Supercharger, and his car wouldn't charge.

""That's when I found out it didn't work. I tried multiple stations. It's just not working,"" he said.

A Tesla representative told him on the phone and later in an email that ""the car is currently unsupported for supercharging and warranties are voided due to salvaged vehicle.""

""I was told it was clean. The CARFAX said it was clean, and I trusted that,"" he said.

The term ""salvage"" was a complete shock, but a deeper dive into the CARFAX vehicle history report, which he didn't pull until after the sale, uncovered a ""minor accident.""

Photos of the damage made it look more than minor, and a Tesla technician told him the repair work as shoddy.

""It was bad enough where they flagged it,"" he said.

Tesla said it's a safety issue connecting a damaged vehicle to the powerful superchargers.

""It's insanely frustrating,"" Boycott said.

Boycott said the network of 70,000 Tesla Superchargers across the country was one of the main reasons he bought the car. Without it, he said long distance trips are nearly impossible.

Fred Lambert, the editor-in-chief of Electrek, a news magazine about electric vehicles, said he's heard of at least one other case where a car with a clean title was labeled ""salvage"" in Tesla's system and blocked from supercharging.

Now Tesla is offering an inspection option for drivers trying to get back on the charging network.

""That's been somewhat controversial, too, because Tesla charges a lot of money. Last time I checked, it was $2,000, but it might have changed since,"" he said.

Boycott said, between the inspection and repairs, ""I want access to the Supercharger network.""

""You know, I don't want to pay like, $10,000 extra on a car that I already agreed to,"" he said.

He said he's still in negotiations with the Downers Grove used car dealership who sold him the vehicle. The owners said Illinois Secretary of State Police investigated and confirmed it has a clean title, and has never had a salvaged title.

In the meantime, he wants other used EV buyers to know, ""I would just take a deeper look into what you're buying, especially with EVs.

""People should trust what they're being sold,"" he added.

According to a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, Stellantis has sought a waiver or at least a reduction on a potential 25% tariff that could affect its medium-duty Ram pickups produced in Mexico. It added that the company’s lobbying efforts have intensified in recent days.

STLA’s stock rose 1.4% in midday trade, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘bullish’ territory. However, chatter fell to ‘normal’ from ‘high’ levels over the past day.

The report stated that General Motors and Ford have urged officials to deny Stellantis’s request. Ford has argued that exempting Stellantis would create a cost advantage over U.S.-assembled trucks that already contain imported components, which are subject to existing tariffs. GM warned that granting relief to Stellantis could set a precedent, prompting other automakers to seek similar exemptions for vehicles built outside the U.S., including Mexican-made Chevrolet and GMC models.

Ford’s stock edged 0.4% higher in midday trade, with retail sentiment dropping to ‘bearish’ from ‘bullish’ and chatter slowing down to ‘high’ from ‘extremely high’ over the past day. Meanwhile, GM’s stock gained 0.14% as sentiment simmered down to ‘neutral’ from ‘bullish’ amid ‘high’ levels of chatter.

The report stated that sources said it remains unclear when a decision on the tariffs will be finalized, or whether any reduction will be granted. The Trump administration has been known to provide tariff relief to companies like Apple (AAPL) and Pfizer (PFI) in exchange for commitments to increase domestic manufacturing.

The report comes as the October 1 deadline, given by President Donald Trump for imposing duties on heavy-duty trucks, has passed, and no official update has come from the White House.

Given this background, it becomes easy to understand how, in this scenario, China has become a global leader in the clean energy transition.
“China has often promised little and achieved much,” notes Andreas Sieber, associate director for policy and campaigns for the global climate nonprofit 350.org, suggesting that China might overdeliver.
On the carbon market Xi has declared his intention to expand the national carbon emission trading market to more emission-intensive sectors than today.
As senior advisor Bernice Lee of the think tank Chatham House notes, China invested $625 billion in the clean energy transition last year alone; that's nearly a third of the gobal total.","Speaking by video at the UN Climate Summit in New York last week, China's president Xi Jinping laid out his country's climate ambitions. While the stated goals may not have been aggressive as some environmentalists would like, Xi at least reaffirmed China's green commitment.

“Despite some countries going against the trend, the international community should stay on the right track, maintain unwavering confidence, unwavering action, and undiminished efforts,” he said. Any reference to Donald Trump and the United States was surely intended (though not explicit).

The march of the energy transition is a long one, but it has to start somewhere. And with this approach, China has already taken quite a few steps.

Beijing Stands (Mostly) Alone

Today, there is no race to be a climate leader. The world is a far fry from the COP26 conference in November 2021, when tackling the threat of climate change seemed like a global priority. A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine; the ensuing energy crisis and inflation kicked climate off of many political agendas.

While Joe Biden and the United States responded to soaring prices with the Inflation Reduction Act, which prioritized investment in renewable energy, Donald Trump subsequently withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement—an international accord to limit global warming—for the second time. The European Union has also stuttered: Too internally divided, it did not go beyond a drab declaration of intent at the UN Climate Summit. There hasn't been much movement from India, a country of nearly 1.5 billion people. And other nations' emissions are simply too small to matter.

Given this background, it becomes easy to understand how, in this scenario, China has become a global leader in the clean energy transition. Xi's speech did not go into much detail, but it did mention all the main points of China's strategy.

Cut Emissions Between 7 Percent and 10 Percent by 2035

In New York, Xi acknowledged the importance of the transition, and for the first time, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rather than simply promise to slow them down. China's stated goal is between 7 percent and 10 percent reduction by 2035.

How do you evaluate these pledges? While the commitment is vague, it's still significant; previously the regime had merely promised to reach peak emissions by 2030, tying the cuts to economic growth. In Xi's speech you can seen China transition from a developing country approach to a role more akin to that of industrialized countries, whose emissions have been declining for decades.

Slow Going?

It should be pointed out that reducing emissions at the pace promised by Beijing means a decline of about 1 percent a year. According to an analysis by William Lamb of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, this is a slower pace than that held by most industrialized nations. Italy, for example, has reduced them by an average of 3.2 percent every 12 months since their peak in 2006; the United Kingdom by an average of 2.8 percent since 2004; France by 2.3 percent.

“China has often promised little and achieved much,” notes Andreas Sieber, associate director for policy and campaigns for the global climate nonprofit 350.org, suggesting that China might overdeliver. The country's lack of democracy also means its policies are not at risk of reversal every election cycle.

On Renewables

Xi Jinping's speech included a commitment to reach 3,600 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035, six times the country's 2020 figures. This is already the leading country in terms of installed renewable power, and a giant on the technology front as well, with universities churning out environmental and climate tech research at full speed, and attracting scientists from abroad across numerous fields. He also announced a commitment to an energy mix with more than 30 percent renewables.

On Electric Vehicles

Mobility has long been an issue for China, which has moved from bicycles, ubiquitous until the 1990s, to the mass automobile. The images of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are unforgettable: A blanket of smog buried the city. The government has in recent years given a strong boost to electric mobility: At the Climate Summit it announced plans to make EVs “mainstream,” that is, prevalent in sales. It helps that it has ready access to rare earth minerals that are essential for building batteries. And for that matter, the country hosts giant automotive companies like BYD and Catl, which supplies batteries to some 50 global brands including Tesla and Volkswagen.

On the carbon market

Xi has declared his intention to expand the national carbon emission trading market to more emission-intensive sectors than today.

On forests

China made additional commitments on forests, which it says will reach an extent of 34 billion cubic meters.

China has reshaped the market for green technologies.

To skeptics expecting broader measures and the mantle of true global leadership from China, well, that's not a particularly coveted title these days—especially if the US continues to reverse course on climate science. As senior advisor Bernice Lee of the think tank Chatham House notes, China invested $625 billion in the clean energy transition last year alone; that's nearly a third of the gobal total.

Not only that: Research and massive adoption of renewable technologies have led to the dramatic drop in prices, and China's very large domestic market is a formidable driver in this regard. ""The rise of Chinese renewables is reshaping the global economy and replacing coal in the domestic market,"" Lee says.

The hope is that other countries, reassured by that commitment, will follow China's example rather than America's.","https://media.wired.com/photos/68defa39baf1f5d9a28509bc/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/2236754552",N,,2025-10-03 21:02:52.837636

Seven County reiterated that agencies are not “required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not exercise regulatory authority.” Id. at 1516; see also Dep’t of Transp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767-68 (2004).

Cumberland

In Cumberland, the court upheld FERC’s conclusions that market need was established by TVA’s promise to buy 100 percent of the pipeline’s capacity for 20 years, and that the pipeline’s benefits outweighed its harms. The court grounded the latter conclusion in its determination that FERC’s environmental impact statement sufficiently addressed the project’s environmental impacts, a conclusion made easier in this case where the pipeline resulted in a net emissions reduction due to the project’s fuel source migration from coal to natural gas.

The court rejected petitioner’s Sabal Trail argument because “it asks [the court] to demand exactly what Seven County says we cannot demand.” The court explained that FERC’s lack of jurisdiction over electric generation precludes the need to study the downstream emissions impacts in the pipeline’s EIS and subsequently recognized that Seven County “abrogated” Sabal Trail. Slip op. at *8.

Although not writing separately, it is noteworthy that Judge Pillard joined the court’s opinion except as to the parts that described Seven County’s effect on FERC’s downstream NEPA analyses and the conclusion that Seven County abrogated Sabal Trail. This indicates that a range of views may exist on the court as to Sabal Trail’s continued viability, which will likely need to be further borne out in subsequent opinions.

Closing Thoughts

Sabal Trail was controversial from the outset. See, e.g., Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1300 (11th Cir. 2019) (“[T]he legal analysis in Sabal Trail is questionable at best. It fails to take seriously the rule of reason announced in Public Citizen or to account for the untenable consequences of its decision.”). In reaching its conclusion, the court needed to reconcile a trio of 2016 liquified natural gas (LNG) cases in which the D.C. Circuit relied on Public Citizen to hold that FERC need not analyze climate-change impacts of LNG exports because the Department of Energy, not FERC, authorizes the export of LNG. The court attempted to do so by asserting that FERC is forbidden from considering the effects of LNG exports as a justification for denying an authorization under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) due to the nature of its delegated authority from DOE; whereas, under section 7, Congress broadly instructed FERC to consider the public convenience and necessity. Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at 1373 (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (explaining that an agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously if it makes a decision based on “factors which Congress had not intended it to consider”)).

However, the court’s reliance on State Farm to distinguish between FERC’s authority under section 3 versus section 7 of the NGA was always suspect because, as recognized in Cumberland, FERC is expressly precluded from regulating electric generators under the Federal Power Act. See 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1) (stating that the FPA does not apply to “facilities used for the generation of electric energy”). So, to the extent that FERC’s consideration of emissions from gas exports would run afoul of the factors Congress intended it to consider under its delegated NGA section 3 authority, FERC would necessarily do the same under NGA section 7 by considering emissions from generators over which it expressly lacks regulatory authority. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that authority to regulate for the public interest “is not a broad license to promote the general welfare,” but rather “the words take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.” NAACP v. FPC, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976). NAACP recognized that FERC’s authority under the NGA must be understood in light of Congress’ principal purpose “to encourage orderly development of plentiful and reasonably priced natural gas.”

In Cumberland, the D.C. Circuit took a major step in closing the door on the Sabal Trail era of its NEPA jurisprudence. It also merits noting that FERC has determined that Seven County obviates its need to consider downstream GHG emissions from sources over which it does not exercise regulatory authority.

A: We operate two natural gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration plants with a total gross capacity of 518MW plants in Mexico.
The two CHP cogeneration plants in Cosoleacaque, Veracruz and Altamira, Tamaulipas, play a vital role in stabilizing the Mexican power grid by delivering reliable and lower-emissions baseload power.
Mexico is avid for new generation; the private and public sectors need to work hand-in-hand to cover Mexico electricity scarcity.
Q: The nearshoring phenomenon is driving a massive increase in demand for industrial power and steam.","Q: ContourGlobal's two combined heat and power (CHP) plants in Mexico are vital assets in your global portfolio. How do these Mexican operations fit into ContourGlobal's long-term global strategy, particularly your company's commitment to becoming a predominantly renewable Independent Power Producer (IPP)?

A: We operate two natural gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration plants with a total gross capacity of 518MW plants in Mexico. These assets form part of our Americas region, where ContourGlobal manages close to 5GW of diversified energy assets and development projects spanning renewable, thermal, and hybrid (solar + BESS) technologies. Beyond Mexico and the Caribbean, our footprint in the region includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and the United States of America.

We are on a transformational growth path to become an independent power producer targeting an installed capacity of around 10GW by 2030. A key driver of this journey is the expansion of our renewable generation mix, which we expect to grow to around 70% of our portfolio at the end of the decade, up from roughly 30% at the time of KKR’s investment in 2022.

Q: In late 2024, ContourGlobal successfully completed a US$525 million refinancing of its Mexican portfolio. What does this vote of confidence from investors signify about the stability and strategic value of your assets in Mexico, even amid regulatory changes?

A: The strong interest by investors and lenders reflected high confidence in ContourGlobal portfolio’s robust operational track record and its strategic importance in Mexico’s energy landscape.

The two CHP cogeneration plants in Cosoleacaque, Veracruz and Altamira, Tamaulipas, play a vital role in stabilizing the Mexican power grid by delivering reliable and lower-emissions baseload power. With nearly 8 years of operational history on average, these assets contribute significantly to Mexico’s energy transition and economic growth, offering enhanced energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions compared to traditional thermal plants.

Q: ContourGlobal's CHP plants are classified as clean energy due to their efficiency. How does this classification position you to support the new administration's goal of doubling clean energy capacity by 2030?

A: ContourGlobal’s cogeneration technology uses 32% less fuel and produces up to 30% less CO2 emissions for the same energy output compared to conventional thermal power generation. This kind of cleaner and more efficient energy is needed to provide grid stability, but we of course applaud the government’s position to doubling clean energy capacity and increase the share of renewable power on the grid. In our view, there is no conflict between natural gas fueled plants and renewable technologies, as both are necessary for accomplishing the government’s energy transition goals.

Natural gas, as a low-emissions dispatchable source, is a crucial system to complement renewables penetration. This is recognized in all clean energy transition scenarios, including the IEA World Energy Outlook. Moreover, our plants are strategically located along the Gulf of Mexico, a region that serves as a key energy and industrial hub for the country. The plants cater to the energy demands of large industrial, commercial, and manufacturing customers, benefiting from Mexico's extensive natural gas pipeline infrastructure.

Q: The new Electricity Sector Law (LESE) reinforces the state's control and mandates CFE's predominance. How does ContourGlobal navigate this new legal framework while ensuring the continued profitability and operational stability of its plant?

A: The reform grants CFE the authority to generate 54% of national electricity without being labeled as a monopoly and mandates that the National Energy Control Center (CENACE) prioritize state-produced energy. As per today, it is not clearly defined how this 54% will be implemented in terms of dispatching, and SENER has mentioned that it will be per merit. Being a grid-critical efficient cogeneration plant we do not expect changes as a result of this new law. We look forward to working with the government to find ways to continue being a good partner and providing solutions to Mexico.

Mexico is avid for new generation; the private and public sectors need to work hand-in-hand to cover Mexico electricity scarcity. The private sector has the funds to support the Government on its goals. Any public-private collaboration model will need to be analyzed and ensure it has bankable terms and the rule of law prevails.

Q: The nearshoring phenomenon is driving a massive increase in demand for industrial power and steam. How is this trend creating opportunities for ContourGlobal, and what role can your plants play in helping Mexico meet the projected need for an additional 37GW of power?

A: Our plants are very efficient and help the industrial sectors with steam and electricity. Cogeneration plants like ours could support the location of industries in specific regions due to the access of steam for its industrial processes and the excess power generated could be sent to the open market to satisfy the need for electricity elsewhere.

To continue running and investing in this type of cogeneration plants it is critical that the new regulation considers that these plants have an obligation to provide steam for industrial processes, and therefore their electricity generation, which basically drives the steam-production volume, needs to be considered baseload.

While the transmission and distribution grid are undergoing much needed expansion and upgrade investments, local generation close to the consumption hubs will be fundamental, so the efficient cogeneration will continue to play a key role in attracting local industrial investments wherever these plants are located. For this reason, supporting investments in these technologies is a way to support the nearshoring.

Q: What are ContourGlobal's key strategic priorities for its Mexico and Caribbean operations for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026?

A: We are celebrating 20 years as a company and have been a reliable partner of Mexico since entering this market in 2019. We have a long-term focus on the region, and are mostly committed to investing to ensure the operational excellence of our existing Mexican assets to keep contributing to the system with reliable and cleaner power. In this historical moment for the country, we want to collaborate with the government by transitioning to the wholesale electricity market in an orderly manner, guaranteeing the actual interest of the company and its current self-supply partners.

Following the recent regulatory changes, ContourGlobal is closely evaluating ways to actively participate in the wholesale electricity market. We believe it is essential to keep open channels of dialogue to coordinate efforts and strengthen our role in the market. The clarity and certainty offered by the new regulation will be critical for cogeneration projects to sustain their operations within a framework that ensures their stable and reliable contribution as an essential component of the power generation system.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-10/Contour-Global-IMG-2025-Eva-Ribera-1-MBN.jpg?h=2cf283a5&itok=2Qs8GF1y,N,,2025-10-03 22:00:30.600817

CARB’s primary goal, as expressed in the proposed rulemaking, is to maintain vehicle emissions requirements already in effect or planned to go into effect at the time of Congress’ disapproval of the California CAA waivers.

Under the CAA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has exclusive and preemptive authority to set nationwide air pollution limits for vehicles; however, the CAA provides California the opportunity to establish more stringent standards if EPA grants a waiver of CAA preemption. This CAA provision was originally adopted to allow California to continue promulgating and enforcing its own stricter vehicle air pollution standards, which had predated the CAA, to address perceived unique and significant adverse air quality conditions in the state. Once granted by EPA, a waiver also allows other states to choose between either the EPA standards or California’s more stringent standards, and several other states have adopted California’s standards.

CARB’s emergency rulemaking comes as a response to two significant actions concerning California’s authority to enforce its own vehicle emission standards. First, on May 22, 2025, Congress adopted three resolutions purporting to disapprove waivers previously granted to California by EPA related to clean vehicle regulations. The State of California, along with 10 other states, subsequently filed a lawsuit on June 12, 2025, against EPA and President Donald Trump to challenge these resolutions. Second, in separate litigation, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed two complaints against CARB on August 13 and 14, 2025, regarding the state’s enforcement of emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and light-duty vehicles, which the DOJ alleges are preempted by the Clean Air Act.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,’’ Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,’’ said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace’’ for innovative energy technologies, he said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download.webp,N,,2025-10-03 22:00:40.601804

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Donald Trump had a warning to Democrats.

Soon he will decide what ""Democrat agencies"" he would cut and whether those reductions would be temporary or permanent.

He said the government shutdown, which began on Tuesday, had afforded him an ""unprecedented opportunity"".

""I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame,"" he posted on his Truth Social website on Thursday morning.

Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, may not be a household name.

But Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for governing put together primarily by former Trump officials like Vought when the Republicans were out of power, featured prominently during last year's presidential campaign.

Project 2025: The right-wing wish list for Trump's second term

Trump threatens axe over 'Democrat Agencies'

The 900-page policy document contained proposals for dramatic reductions in the size of federal government, expanded presidential authority, rigorous immigration enforcement, a nationwide abortion ban and other elements of an ultra-conservative social agenda.

It was frequently touted by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, as Trump's ""dangerous plan"" for the future if he was to win.

At the time, seeking to reassure undecided voters, Trump tried to distance himself from the policy document.

""I know nothing about Project 2025,"" Trump wrote in July 2024. ""I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.""

Now, however, Trump is using the conservative blueprint as a threat to get Democrats to agree to his budgetary demands. And he is holding up Vought, who authored a chapter on the use of executive power, as a kind of budgetary angel of death, ready to take a scythe to government programmes near and dear to Democrats.

In case that particular metaphor wasn't clear, on Thursday night Trump shared an AI-generated parody music video on Truth Social with Vought portrayed as the grim reaper, set to altered lyrics of Blue Oyster Cult's Don't Fear the Reaper.

On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders have echoed Trump's characterisation of Vought as the White House heavy.

""We don't control what he's going to do,"" Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. ""This is the risk of shutting down the government and handing the keys to Russ Vought.""

Why the US government has shut down and what happens now

Senator Mike Lee of Utah told Fox News that Vought had been ""preparing for this moment since puberty"".

That may be a bit of an overstatement, but Vought, who cut his teeth as a congressional staffer for Republican budget hawks and helped run the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has a wealth of experience digging through the intricacies of the federal budget.

The bean-counter behind the president

He spent a year as the deputy director of the White House budget office during Trump's first term, rising to be its director in 2019. Unlike many who served with Trump during those first four years, Vought had staying power - and was quickly reinstalled as head of the budget office when Trump returned this year.

""A lot of those who didn't come back represent an old way of thinking,"" said Richard Stern, a Heritage economic policy director who, like Vought, began his career in conservative congressional budget circles. ""Russ was ahead of his time in the first term and right on time now.""

Although Vought isn't one to shy away from controversial statements – he once said that he aspired to be ""the person who crushes the deep state"" – he doesn't exactly look the part of a Republican bogeyman.

Balding and bespectacled, with a greying beard, Vought's public statements typically have the measured cadence of a bean-counter or professor. He lacks the narrow-eyed glower and amped-up rhetoric of Stephen Miller, another longtime Trump adviser who oversees White House immigration policy.

Make no mistake, however, Vought has become an influential player in this White House, having turned the Office of Management and Budget – usually referred to by its acronym OMB - into the principal engine behind Trump's push to slash government spending and its workforce.

Earlier in the year he worked closely with Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or ""Doge"", as they cut a scorched-earth path through the federal government, shuttering multiple agencies and downsizing entire departments. And he carried on the efforts after Musk departed and Doge largely dropped out of public view.

""OMB is an intrinsically powerful position, but it has almost never been wielded as such,"" Stern said. ""Its people have tended to caretake and allow the bureaucracy to slowly grow. It is as influential as the person who wields that chair wants to make it.""

Seizing opportunity in shutdown

Now Trump has threatened to unleash Vought at a time when, because of the legal limbo created by the government shutdown, their cuts might be deeper and more durable than those instituted earlier this year by Doge.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a veteran of the big shutdown fights of the 1990s, told NPR that Vought and his team have been preparing for exactly these kind of circumstances while they were in the political wilderness during the Biden years.

""They all knew a government shutdown was possible,"" he said. ""I think they had decided early on that you're only going to get the scale of change they want if you're very tough and very determined and every chance you get, you take the opportunity.""

The opportunity this shutdown presents for budget-cutters like Vought is that, without congressionally approved funding, the government is operating in a legal grey area with fewer budgetary restrictions.

Four ways the US government shutdown could end

The White House can, in theory, slash funding and staffing deeper than it could earlier in the year, when spending was governed by baseline appropriation amounts. And while permanent layoffs would still have to abide by a 60-day notice, Vought could start that clock ticking whenever he, and Trump, so choose.

Vought already has announced major infrastructure projects in New York City and Chicago are on hold, citing the need for a review of potentially illegal racial hiring practices - a review that he said can't take place during the shutdown. He's also cancelled nearly $8bn in clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which backed Harris, Trump's opponent, in last year's presidential race.

Democrats and federal worker unions have promised to fight these reductions in court and claimed that Trump is making largely empty threats to try to pressure them into abandoning the fight.

Many economists have pointed out that the White House reductions have been accompanied by other deficit-ballooning policies, which could undercut their attacks on Democrats for being the party of fiscal irresponsibility.

""Republicans are increasing spending in other areas and cutting taxes at the same time,"" Brett House, an economics professor at the Columbia University School of Business noted. ""The notion that they're devoted to fiscal prudence is not borne out by their actions.""

Some Republicans in Congress have expressed concern that the apparent glee with which Trump is touting Vought-ordered cuts could turn public opinion against them if the shutdown stretches on.

Republicans have been warning of the dire consequences of the shutdown on government services - part of a concerted effort to portray Democrats as the ones to blame. Doing so while celebrating the new ways the administration is slashing programmes could derail those efforts.

""Russ is less politically in tune than the president,"" South Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, a member of the ""Doge caucus"", told the news website Semafor.

""We, as Republicans, have never had so much moral high ground on a government funding bill in our lives… I just don't see why we would squander it, which I think is the risk of being aggressive with executive power in this moment.""

Thom Tills, a North Carolina senator who has chosen not to run for re-election next year, warns that administration officials ""need to be really careful"" in how they present any new cuts.

The Doge-directed layoffs and programme cuts were largely unpopular, according to public-opinion surveys, causing a drag on the president's approval ratings. A reprise of that now could be perilous.

According to Stern, however, the White House, and Vought, may view the long-term benefits as well worth the short-term challenges.

""For Russ, for myself, for anybody who's in the budget space, this country is going bankrupt,"" he said. ""Whatever the political risks of trying to do the right thing, we have to do it. If we do nothing, this country will implode.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/323f/live/91f80ab0-a082-11f0-bb47-b30225268691.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 19:01:39.675863

The Democrat-led shutdown is halting paychecks for our troops and federal law enforcement, furloughing and risking the jobs of federal employees, jeopardizing flood insurance and healthcare services, and cutting off nutrition support for low-income mothers and children in need. Today, Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) and Subcommittee Cardinals warned these are not hypothetical consequences—everyday families are paying the price because Democrats are refusing to reopen the government with a clean, nonpartisan funding extension.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, ""What are Democrats achieving by instigating a shutdown and keeping the federal government closed? Nothing but pain, risked livelihoods, and throwing the entire nation into chaos and uncertainty. It’s absolutely reckless to do what Democrats are doing. I authored the clean legislation they rejected to keep the government open and working, and I know exactly what’s in it: no partisan provisions, no poison pills, no political gimmicks—just a short-term, responsible extension. If they can’t be for that, then they’ve abandoned the most basic duty of public service: keeping the government working for the people.""

Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) said, ""The cost of the government being shutdown is adding up to big losses, including potentially missed paychecks for FBI agents who combat violent crime, weakening national security and law enforcement operations that keep Americans safe. Meanwhile, we are setting back efforts to revive domestic manufacturing with unnecessary delays in licensing and critical economic data. Also, after a devastating year of deadly natural disasters, our National Weather Service employees who provide 24/7 lifesaving severe weather alerts will not be paid until the shutdown ends. House Republicans voted to keep the government open to avoid these setbacks, and it’s time for Washington Democrats to put the American people first.""

Labor, Health and Human Services, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Robert Aderholt (R-AL) said, ""Without the funding needed to process grants that support rural hospitals, we risk even more closures—and with them, the loss of essential care for millions of Americans in rural communities.""

Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, ""Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats have shut down the government due to their far-left, unreasonable policy demands. These political games have very real consequences for Americans, especially throughout the West. Whether it's jeopardizing wildfire preparedness, the partial or total closure of our public lands and national parks, or preventing the issuance of permits for continued economic growth and development, the American people should never pay the price for government dysfunction. As Chairman of the House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I wholeheartedly disagree with the Democrats' reckless decision. I am closely monitoring the impacts this shutdown will have on these agencies, and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to consider how their actions harm Americans.""

Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman John Carter (R-TX) said, ""The Democratic party has chosen to play politics with the American people and our heroes, and it’s unacceptable. This Schumer shutdown is delaying vital services for veterans, including transition program assistance and career counseling. It’s time for Senate Democrats to stop the political performance, vote for the clean CR, and get back to work.""

Defense Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA) said, ""American service members stationed here at home and deployed around the globe are already asked to make extraordinary sacrifices. The last thing we should ever do is play political games with the pay that they and their families depend on.

National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) said, ""This shutdown isn’t just a lapse in funding—it’s a lapse in our ability to effectively counter the deadly flow of illicit drugs into our country.

Under Chairman Tom Cole’s leadership, House Republicans did our job—we passed all 12 appropriations bills out of committee, including strong national security provisions in my subcommittee’s bill. This is just one of the many devastating consequences of Senate Democrats' failure to act.""

Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Steve Womack (R-AR) said, ""When Democrats blocked a straightforward funding extension to keep the government open, they voted to force air traffic controllers and FAA employees to work without pay, jeopardizing the safety of our national airspace. These critical workers deserve better as they ensure safer skies for our nation, and Americans deserve better than petty politics that puts air travel and public safety at risk.""

Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) said, ""Democrats’ stupid, unnecessary, and harmful shutdown needlessly jeopardizes our national security, energy dominance, and important work to modernize our nuclear deterrent. The childish political games that Democrats are playing put every American at risk and allow our adversaries to have strategic leverage over the United States while our government is shut down. It’s far past time for Democrats to end their tantrum and pass our clean, non-partisan CR to allow the government to reopen and get back to work.""

Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee Chairman David Joyce (R-OH) said, ""The Democrat imposed shutdown is having drastic effects on all the federal agencies throughout the government, impacting services critical for millions of Americans. The Small Business Administration isn't issuing new loans, the Federal Communications Commission cannot address consumer complaints, and federal employees aren't able to access human resources services.""

Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) said, ""The clean, House-passed CR fully funds WIC—a program Democrats themselves have demanded be protected at every turn. It is shocking the Democrats would now vote to shut down the government, threatening the very WIC funding they claim to champion.""

Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Mark Amodei (R-NV) said, ""The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security serve and protect our communities every day, knowing their families worry each time they leave home.

Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other law enforcement personnel will continue risking their lives for our safety, yet return home without pay for that service. These shutdowns don’t just disrupt government, they disrupt lives, leaving real people and real families to face greater uncertainty. It’s those who serve our nation who ultimately bear the cost.""

Legislative Branch Subcommittee Chairman David Valadao (R-CA) said, ""As Chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, I’m proud of the work my colleagues on the committee and I accomplished to keep the Capitol, Library of Congress, and other historic institutions open and accessible to students, families, and visitors from across the country and around the world. Unfortunately, because Congressional Democrats chose to force an unnecessary government shutdown, these doors are now closed.

Published 5:25 pm Friday, October 3, 2025

The neutering of the Environmental Protection Agency by those who are now running it will not end the fight to clean the air we breathe and the water we drink, but collectively, the actions are a devastating blow that will impact us, our children and grandchildren.

Protection of the environment is rarely, if ever, viewed as a profitable venture by business, and, given the opportunity, too many large businesses — especially those that can have the greatest negative impact on our lives — would rather look the other way than to acknowledge and correct damage they might be causing to the air above them and the waterways at their feet.

The announcements by the EPA this year include plans to end the declaration that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The agency has already redefined its interpretation of “Waters of the United States” in order to sharply reduce the amount of wetlands that it will try to protect in the future. And, most recently, the agency announced that power plants will no longer have to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

I was thinking about the EPA’s 180-degree turn as I was going through old Smithfield Times files to work on a column that ran a couple of weeks ago about George and Jane Webb.

At the heart of that research was the Kepone disaster that was discovered in 1975. It was a classic case of industry doing something it had to know was harmful, but highly profitable, and getting away with it so long as everyone looked the other way, including a local government.

Allied Chemical in Hopewell had concocted a chlorinated hydrocarbon that came to be known as Kepone. It was deadly effective in killing ants, cockroaches and most anything else you wanted to kill. Trouble was, it was also toxic to humans, so much so that Allied had a subsidiary, ironically named “Life Sciences,” set up a tiny plant in an abandoned service station in Hopewell to manufacture the stuff.

When a Life Sciences employee who lived in Hopewell developed uncontrollable shakes, the city started looking and found that its sewage treatment plant was malfunctioning because of slugs of Kepone entering it. From there, the stuff poured into the James River.

Events moved rapidly at that point. The State Water Control Board stepped in and, with assistance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, took samples of river bottom to determine how much of the stuff had escaped. Many tons was the finding. Kepone had contaminated the James River bottom all the way to Hampton Roads.

WCB officials went to Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr., who in December 1975 ordered the James River closed to all fishing for fear that people would ingest the poison.

Kepone levels were highest in resident fish, which were part of the James River food chain year-round, such as catfish, perch and crabs. Anadromous fish, which migrate into the bay and rivers each year and include striped bass, shad, croakers and spot, ingested lesser amounts.

However, the closure initially shut down the river to the taking of anything, and the effect was devastating. Watermen went bankrupt and commercial seafood companies suffered when people stopped buying Virginia seafood, no matter whether it came from the James River or elsewhere. Bait stores suffered, as did anyone else relying on sports or commercial fishing.

It took time and a lot of money to safely remove the Kepone sludge from the Hopewell wastewater plant and to demolish and clean up the hazardous waste site that had been Life Sciences. Meanwhile, nature slowly covered the Kepone in the bottom of the James with layers of silt.

Today, few people even remember what Kepone was. It should be an effective reminder that industry cannot always be trusted to do the “right thing” when the more profitable route does harm. Harm is most certainly not the intention of profit-driven industry, but whether intended or coincidental, harm to humans is just that.

In our rush to return to the 1950s, we might want to reflect on Kepone and the devastation it caused along the historic river we call the James.",https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/07/John-Edwards-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 18:03:10.578512

The Public News Service Friday afternoon update.

I'm Mike Clifford.

Today marks day three of the government shutdown.

NBC News reports the Senate will vote this afternoon on the Democratic and Republican short-term spending bills, which have failed to advance several times.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said if the measures are blocked again, the Senate will adjourn until Monday, extending the government shutdown into a sixth day.

NBC notes the majority of Trump supporters back tax subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans the new poll conducted in the days before the shutdown was found.

An extension of Obamacare subsidies, which expire at the year's end, is a key sticking point for Democrats in the fight.

Meantime, the government shutdown is getting attention, but farmers in South Dakota also wonder where things stand with agriculture programs now that the Farm Bill has expired.

Without new action, some critical programs will continue, but others are paused.

Michael Happ of the Midwest-based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy says Congress should know farmers are operating under a much different model than 2018, the last time a farm bill passed.

Input costs are through the roof.

Corn prices in particular are way down.

And then, yeah, we have the uncertainty from the tariffs.

Economists say tariffs were felt during President Donald Trump's first term, but now global customers like China are buying commodities from other nations.

I'm Mike Moen.

And federal tax credits for electric vehicles Vehicle standards ended yesterday.

Advocates say the end of the policies will put the US at a disadvantage.

President Donald Trump signed his budget reconciliation bill in July, ending federal EV tax credits and fuel economy standards.

EV sales represent 12 percent of cars sold in 2024, according to the Maryland Department of Transportation.

The end of the tax credits may also pump the brakes on the state's plan to have all model year 2035 vehicles sold in the state be electric.

Ingrid Malmgren with Plugin America says there's been a concerted effort to ensure vehicles in the U.S. are run on gasoline or diesel.

There's been a lot of money spent in the 2024 election cycle by oil and gas interests, and this appears to be the administration and congressional leadership's way of paying back for all of those donations and funding.

Republican lawmakers and Trump have railed against EV tax credits.

They argue the market should determine what vehicle consumers drive, rather than government incentives to prop up the industry.

I'm Zimone Perez.

Next to the Keystone State, where Philadelphia and Allentown are among the toughest U.S. cities for people with asthma, Anna Santos-Rushman of Villanova University says Allentown ranked first last year, while Philadelphia's situation is worsening.

There's the urban part of things, so you're seeing, you know, relatively large cities being listed.

Pollution is another of the big factors here, asthma.

By the way, Pittsburgh is faring better at 44th and Harrisburg at 15th.

According to the latest Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America report, more than 28 million Americans have asthma.

This is Public News Service.

As the contested case hearing for the Enbridge Line 5 relocation project wraps up today in Madison, supporters of the project are urging people to remember what's at stake for rural Wisconsin.

Environmental groups and the Bad River Tribe are challenging permits the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued to Enbridge in November for rerouting the pipeline.

After weeks of testimony, final statements are expected today.

Nate Zimdars with Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation emphasizes what's at stake for farmers who depend on propane, a byproduct from Line 5.

Oftentimes our farmers are forgotten about in conversations like this.

Just think about the food that's getting put on your table.

It's got to come from somewhere. comes from our farmers who are working really hard during this time of year and are dependent on that energy.

He emphasizes farmers are already experiencing the strains of the federal government shutdown and difficult economic conditions.

Opponents of the pipeline are just as determined saying rerouting Line 5 would be detrimental to the environment, increasing water contamination and threatening cultural resources.

I'm Judith Ruiz Branch reporting.

And the number of women behind bars in New Mexico and across the globe has increased by nearly 60 percent in the past 25 years, according to a new Prison Policy Initiative report.

New Mexico ranks 17th among the states, with women ages 29 to 49 making up 9 percent of the confined population.

Wanda Bertram with the initiative says many states are doubling down on prosecuting low-level offenses that women are vulnerable to when going through hard times.

Offenses that are associated with homelessness, right, like sleeping on the street, panhandling, trespassing offenses that are correlated with poverty, like petty theft, drug offenses.

Among U.S. states, South Dakota had the most women incarcerated, followed by Montana and Idaho.

I'm Roz Brown.

Finally, an environmental group is voicing concerns about the safety of drinking water in Tennessee.

According to the EPA monitoring data, 14 water systems in the state show PFAS levels that exceed federal limits.

Dan Firth with the Sierra Club Tennessee says the EPA issued a drinking water standard for what are often called forever chemicals.

And it was expected that the water treatment plans would need to remove them.

But under the Trump administration, Firth says the EPA is now delaying or scrapping those rules.

In regards to the reason why we still have them is because the EPA is not letting the rules go into force that would require the treatment of that water to bring it down to regulatory acceptable limits.

EPA data shows more than 172 million people have been exposed to these forever chemicals this year.

Quantum and fusion — both priority sectors under the California Jobs First Economic Blueprint — are key examples of California’s leadership, with the state leading the way in research and development, talent, and new discoveries.

Quantum: computing capability for the future

Quantum computing has the potential to solve equations in mere minutes that would take existing computers thousands of years to complete — enabling immense potential to enhance medication discovery, improve artificial intelligence tools, combat climate change, and model complex scenarios. Quantum sensing has the ability to revolutionize how we see the world, and quantum communication will usher in unhackable quantum networks.

California is the only state that is home to both National Science Foundation and Department of Energy quantum federal research centers — and is positioned as the strongest in this space. California is producing the nation’s top talent in quantum, is home to five of the world’s top 15 artificial intelligence programs (UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UCLA, Stanford, and Caltech) and leads in quantum computing research with centers at UC Berkeley, UCLA, University of Southern California, and Stanford, as well as the Google Quantum AI Campus affiliated with UC Santa Barbara, Microsoft’s Station Q lab with UC Santa Barbara, and the Amazon Web Services Center for Quantum Computing at Caltech.

✅ More quantum: Today, the Governor is signing Assembly Bill 940, authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) to drive California’s efforts forward by creating a statewide strategy to transform quantum research into industry output. Under the bill, the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development will publish a strategic framework, aligned with the state’s Economic Blueprint, to help grow the quantum economy in regions throughout the state.

The Governor is also announcing an additional $4 million budgeted to support quantum research and innovation. This funding was part of the 2025-2026 Final Budget.

“Quantum will define the future — and with AB 940, California is claiming its place at the forefront,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland). “By directing the development of a statewide strategy, this bill ensures we are positioning ourselves to lead in quantum innovation, create good-paying jobs, and capture the immense economic value this technology will generate. I’m grateful to Governor Newsom for signing this bill and to all the partners who recognize the urgency of investing in this transformative technology.”

Fusion: clean energy to fuel the future

Fusion occurs when two atoms slam together to form a heavier atom, releasing a tremendous amount of energy — the same energy that powers the sun. Fusion has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry, help achieve energy abundance and security, and help meet the nation’s growing clean energy needs.

California’s fusion ecosystem is the largest in the nation, boasting world-leading federal research facilities and private investment firms, which serve as primary drivers of the state’s fusion innovation system. California hosts both of the nation’s premier fusion research centers: the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego, the United States’ largest magnetic-confinement (tokamak) user facility, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the world’s most energetic laser for inertial-confinement fusion, where researchers achieved the first laboratory fusion ignition in December 2022, marking a critical step in fusion viability. California is also currently incorporating fusion into its energy goals through the California Energy Commission.

✅ More fusion: Today, the Governor is signing Senate Bill 80, authored by Senator Anna Caballero (D-Merced), which helps accelerate the development and growth of fusion energy by creating the Fusion Research and Development Innovation Initiative to distribute $5 million toward advancing research and development into fusion energy. This initiative and investment will help accelerate the deployment of new research and technology capabilities that support the commercialization of fusion energy, with the goal of delivering the world’s first fusion energy pilot project in the state by the 2040s, to help achieve the state’s 100% by 2045 clean electricity goal.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AB-30-signed.png,N,,2025-10-03 19:01:22.871609

But the project is now one of the casualties from the $7.56 billion in U.S. Department of Energy funding cuts to hundreds of renewable energy projects in mostly blue states, including New Jersey and Delaware. No projects were cut in Pennsylvania, a state that voted for President Donald Trump in November.

Delaware and New Jersey, however, stand to lose approximately $43.5 million from the cancellations, according to a list released by Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee.

“We’re now having to beg for internal funding to continue some of the work,” Birnie said. “The funds are short internally and so it’s hard to do what we had hoped to do with the DOE funding.”

Wednesday’s move to cancel 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects in 16 Democratic-led states appeared to show Trump’s administration taking advantage of the government shutdown to punish Democratic states.

“Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” said Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a post on social platform X.

Democratic New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone criticised the Trump administration’s decision on social media.

“The Trump Admin continues to steal billions of dollars in promised funds to communities in New Jersey and other states that Trump lost last year,” Pallone posted on X. “Congress should stand united against this ongoing illegal action, but Republicans continue to sit on the sidelines as Trump kills jobs and increases monthly energy bills.”

Rutgers’ agrivoltaics was initially awarded $1.6 million. But DOE nixed $602,180 of that, Schoolman said.

He said one of their partners was Delaware State University, a historically Black university. He said DSU used its part of the grant to do outreach activities and had planned to build its own experimental research site.

“They were really excited about it,” Schoolman said. “And the administration was very excited about it, and it was kind of a big deal for them to have this grant.”

DSU’s funding was cut by $67,000, Schoolman said. A DSU spokesperson confirmed their participation and said they have yet to receive a notice canceling the award from the Trump administration.

Rutgers had funding terminated for two other projects, according to the Appropriations Committee list, totaling $6.2 million for all three.

According to the Department of Energy’s list of project terminations, the University of Delaware, Chemours Company and Princeton University also lost funding.

Moment Energy, a company registered in Delaware, had their project in Texas defunded.

Delaware Democratic Congresswoman Sarah McBride said in a statement that the termination of these projects is a political ploy that will raise energy costs for Delawareans who are already facing high costs.

“These are mobster tactics — the Trump administration is illegally slashing programs during this government shutdown in an attempt to force Democrats to vote for their cuts to health care and other lifesaving services,” she said. “I will not be intimidated into giving this president a blank check to dismantle the very programs families rely on.”

Funding cuts affect red states too

DOE’s announcement and subsequent list includes the names of the recipient, but not the name of the project or the amount of money being eliminated.

But through DOE contract numbers and news releases, WHYY News identified several of the likely affected projects.

Moment Energy was awarded $20 million last year to build a factory in Taylor, Texas, to repurpose electric vehicle batteries. Democrats said the entire award was terminated. The company is headquartered in Canada.

Chemours, a chemical company headquartered in Wilmington, was given $60 million in 2024 for projects related to clean hydrogen energy production. The House Appropriations list of projects shows the company’s funding was cut by $10 million.

The University of Delaware suffered a total loss of $6.5 million for two projects, one was for developing large offshore wind blade spar caps and the other was related to using artificial intelligence to manufacture composite materials for products like cars and airplanes. The collaboration includes the University of Florida, South Carolina State University and Ohio State University.

Princeton University research on energy technologies, including solar, biomass, hydrogen and fuel cells, wind, hydropower and geothermal technology, was cut by nearly $2 million.

Requests for comment to Moment Energy, Chemours, The University of Delaware and Princeton University received no response.

In its news release Wednesday, the Trump administration said that “following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Despite slashing funds for two hydrogen hubs on the west coast, the Philadelphia region’s MACH2 clean energy hub, which includes a number of projects in Delaware, was spared.

All of the award recipients whose funding was eliminated have 30 days to appeal the decisions.

Mills,,,,,https://www.city-journal.org/article/ai-data-center-construction-worker-jobs,"But the surprise for our times is how those coders and computer scientists are driving a massive increase in demand for construction workers.
It’s hard to ignore the irony that ever-more clever code, especially AI, has resulted in a frenzied buildout of data centers.
The rate of private sector spending on data center construction has surpassed construction spending on all other U.S. commercial buildings.
How did the world of bits and bytes become the second-largest source of demand for construction workers, trailing only residential housing?
To Build, Baby, Build!","Remember all the excitement over “coding for kindergartners?” The belief that coding was a surefire path to a future job inspired everything from coding camps for high schoolers to coding classes for seniors.

Consider some recent headlines. “Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle,” read an August one in the New York Times. “The Computer-Science Bubble is Bursting,” warned a June headline in The Atlantic.

Coding was never going to become a dominant employment opportunity. The number of Americans working as farmers or ranchers is seven times greater than those toiling as coders or computer scientists. Both farming and coding constitute a tiny sliver of the total workforce, and while both excite certain demographics, neither is a primary vector for future employment. That’s because such specializations, while important, of course, will continue to be niche jobs.

In fact, coders and computer programmers, including those with AI skills, account for less than 1 percent of all STEM jobs. But the surprise for our times is how those coders and computer scientists are driving a massive increase in demand for construction workers.

In July, the White House released its manifesto, “Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan,” at a high-profile event that drew a who’s who of tech and industrial titans. It was a call-to-arms to “build and maintain vast AI infrastructure and the energy to power it,” and in that report we find the signature line: “Build, Baby, Build!” To do that, America will need construction workers, a cohort that constitutes about one-fifth of all skilled trade workers.

It’s hard to ignore the irony that ever-more clever code, especially AI, has resulted in a frenzied buildout of data centers. The rate of private sector spending on data center construction has surpassed construction spending on all other U.S. commercial buildings. It’s also more than current total spending on manufacturing facilities or power plants.

This surge carries big implications for jobs. All major construction projects draw from the same pool of skilled workers. Every data center that goes up means fewer workers available to build what many policymakers see as equal or higher priorities: reshoring factories, mines, shipyards, repairing roads and bridges, and new homes.

How did the world of bits and bytes become the second-largest source of demand for construction workers, trailing only residential housing? Two sets of facts hold the answer.

First, code runs on machines. Some are tiny, like smartphones and earbuds. But the cloud—thousands of data centers linked together across the globe—is where the real computing power lives. It enables everything from streaming sports to navigating cars, from banking to scientific research. Global sales of cloud services, the code in the Cloud, are nearing $1 trillion annually and climbing fast.

Those cloud data centers—enormous buildings packed with silicon processors—are what Google calls “warehouse-scale computers.” Each one costs as much as a skyscraper to build and consumes even more steel and concrete. It should come as no surprise, then, that erecting a warehouse-scale computer takes about as much labor as putting up a skyscraper or laying down a highway.

That brings us to the second set of facts. Most big projects—ships, bridges, power plants, or data centers—draw on the same kinds of skills: equipment operators, electricians, welders, carpenters, and the like. A rule of thumb: every $1 billion in construction spending requires 5,000 to 10,000 workers.

But, as Mike Rowe of Dirty Jobs fame points out, our culture “has glorified the ‘corner office job’ while unintentionally belittling the jobs that helped build the corner office.” Given the stampede to build data centers, we can revise Rowe’s aphorism: our culture has glorified coders while unintentionally belittling the jobs that helped build the machines that make coding possible.

The United States faces a shortage of skilled-trade workers. Those in the skilled trades sector are, on average, older than the rest of the workforce, and fewer young people are entering the pipeline. To Build, Baby, Build! as the White House exhorts, we’ll need lots more construction workers. What’s to be done?

Policymakers have only three tools at their disposal. First, they can encourage many in the aging workforce to delay retirement. Second, they can fill the pipeline with more people learning the skilled trades. Third, and probably most politically challenging, they can import skilled labor. Fortunately, technology itself plays a big role in the first two.

First, the aging workforce. Many on the front edge of the so-called silver tsunami are leaving the trades for a simple reason: construction work is hard. These are Mike Rowe’s dirty jobs—physically demanding and sometimes dangerous.

Innovators have perfected and are commercializing semiautomated and fully automated machines that augment human strength and reduce the heavy physical lifting. Consider, for example, the wearable exoskeleton that’s no longer the stuff of science fiction. Commercially available systems can minimize stress on specific joints and muscles or even the whole body.

Of course, with automation, the go-to focus has been on robo-trucks—many such have long been deployed at mine sites, with more becoming commercially available for public roads—which can free up drivers to be re-skilled for other construction tasks. Industrial automation is a long-standing solution for amplifying hard labor. Ask farmers. However, there’s far less automation across non-farm industries than most imagine, especially when it comes to robots. While nearly every construction-equipment maker is developing semiautonomous or fully autonomous machines, the barrier to adoption is always the need to realign processes and train workers. For the foreseeable future, most automation will still depend on skilled human operators.

AI can help—not only by making machines more capable, but by delivering faster, easier, and better training. Commentators who warn that AI will eliminate jobs often have it backward. True, AI can sometimes cut in half the labor needed for a task. But just as often, AI can make existing workers twice as productive—a particularly powerful advantage given the shortages in the skilled trades.

That brings us to the second tool for expanding the skilled workforce: convincing more people to pursue a career in the trades. Here, policymakers should tap into the vast potential workforce among young men released from prison for nonviolent offenses by expanding inmates’ access to vocational education. Only a small fraction of this group currently receives such training.

And to train more would-be tradesmen in general, we need to make training more effective—and more interesting. Technology can help here, too. Leading construction-equipment makers already use virtual reality and augmented-reality systems for their training simulators. Tests show VR training significantly improves users’ training-completion and employment outcomes.

Virtual-reality flight simulators have been the mainstay of the skills-centric aviation industry for a long time. While the heavy equipment “operator training simulator” market is already north of $10 billion annually, the technology remains greatly underutilized. Now, AI is taking simulators to the next level.

The third option, importing skilled labor, is a political third rail. But it shouldn’t be dismissed. One could imagine, for example, a visa program aimed at the trades—a “Steel Visa”—to fast-track qualified foreign workers into the U.S. Selectively expanding the labor pool this way could help avoid delays or cancellations of major construction projects and also mitigate inflationary wage spikes.

Expanding and enhancing the skilled labor pool will require both technology and capital. Instead of launching a massive federal program, Washington should expect deep-pocketed tech firms to provide both.

The American economy will continue to need students to pursue both STEM and skilled trade jobs, each of which represents about one-fifth of the U.S. workforce. That’s likely to be the case for a long time yet. And that’s a good thing.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/AI-data-center-construction-worker-jobs.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 22:00:46.019664

Dive Brief:

The lapse in government appropriations following the federal government shutdown this week will affect clean energy project developers and corporate tax credit buyers, according to a recent analysis from sustainable finance company Crux.

Crux, which connects clean energy tax credit buyers and sellers, said that it expects most functions of the Internal Revenue Service to continue normally if the shutdown lasts less than two weeks. But other agencies involved in clean energy grants and permitting are expected to be immediately impacted, it said.

“Public equity and debt markets do not appear substantially shaken by the shutdown, which may change if the shutdown lingers or triggers other significant economic harm,” Crux said.

Dive Insight:

With both political parties dug in and blaming each other for the shutdown, Crux said Wednesday that it is difficult to forecast how long it will last.

The last time the federal government shutdown was 2018-19, which lasted for 35 days and marked the longest shutdown on record.

While “essential” functions to maintain public safety, fulfill specific legal obligations or protect property will continue in the shutdown, all other activities funded through annual appropriations will be paused.

Crux said that while shutdown plans have been published for the Departments of Treasury, Interior and Energy, US Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Environmental Protection Agency, “it’s possible these become hard to implement” as agency staffing levels “are significantly lower than at the beginning of the year.”

“This makes it difficult to predict exactly how agencies will operate during this shutdown, though activities such as permitting, rulemaking, and grantmaking will likely see impacts and delays,” the company said in its analysis.

The IRS’ continued operations carries implications for calendar-year tax filers hoping to satisfy their 2024 tax liabilities through transferable credits, as well as clean energy developers who await the agency’s regulatory guidance on foreign entities of concern.

For corporate calendar-year tax filers, the extended tax filing deadline is Oct. 15, and any companies looking to use 2024 credits will need a pre-filing registration number. Crux anticipates that most companies already have received these registration numbers, and the portal awarding those registration numbers will continue operating.

As for pending guidance on FEOC provisions included in Republicans’ Congressional megabill, clean energy developers are expecting to receive instructions in “the coming weeks,” Crux said.

However, while the IRS is expected to continue to operate in a short-term shutdown, furloughed or affected staff at the Office of Management and Budget and other agencies could delay the release of the guidance.

At the Bureau of Land Management within the Department of Interior, permitting for oil, gas, transmission infrastructure and rights-of-way and new leasing for energy and minerals were included in President Trump’s January national energy emergency declaration. Also at Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will “cease all renewable energy activities,” and “non-time sensitive offshore conventional energy activities.”

Most activities are also expected to cease at FERC, while public safety and grid reliability functions will continue.

EPA will halt all operations of new grants, permits and interagency actions during the shutdowns, and Crux said DOE offices with multi-year appropriations or appropriations with no designated year “may operate for several days or even weeks with minimal disruption, but impacts increase if the shutdown persists.”

Crux said energy-related permitting, rulemaking and grant awards at those agencies are “most at risk” during the shutdown.

Typically, federal workers are furloughed during shutdowns and given backpay once the government reopens. However, OMB Director Russ Vought has asked agencies to submit reductions in force plans during the shutdown.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ICD-OOiALfNuieQGJ7--Z1OEPnqSnL9z0xnpiPRGA5k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UaHVuZV9zaHV0ZG93bi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-03 20:00:32.525005

In Connecticut, 12 projects were terminated, representing $52.3 million in direct federal support and about $64.8 million in total investment once required matching contributions are included. The cancellations halted work in hydrogen, fuel cells, grid resilience, and low-carbon building materials — areas the state has sought to position at the core of its clean-energy economy.

House Appropriations Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, D-CT, said the cancellations “weaponize policy for political revenge,” warning they would drive up energy bills, kill jobs, and strip Connecticut of federal investment it had already won. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-New Britain, called the cuts “a direct partisan attack” on her constituents.

“This will result in layoffs and rising energy costs. Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills,” Hayes said.

The cancellations spanned six Energy Department offices, covering nearly every part of its portfolio. They included Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Grid Deployment Office, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, ARPA-E, and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.

Connecticut’s $52.3 Million Federal Loss

Twelve Connecticut clean energy projects were terminated, including four totaling $14.54 million that RTX Corporation — formerly known as Raytheon — was working on.

Mott Corporation (Farmington) — $10.0M

Engineering porous transport layers to improve water electrolysis efficiency.

Linde Inc. (Connecticut operations) — $9.5M

Expanding hydrogen fueling infrastructure through a “refueling station of the future.”

RTX Tech Research Center (East Hartford) — $4.8M

Retrofitting large industrial gas turbines to run entirely on hydrogen.

Karpman Consulting (West Hartford) — $4.0M

Supporting stronger residential building codes under the International Energy Conservation Code.

Proton Energy Systems / Nel Hydrogen US (Wallingford) — $3.92M

Advancing anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis as a lower-cost alternative to PEM.

RTX Corporation (East Hartford) — $3.8M

Designing a conformable liquid-hydrogen storage tank for aircraft and heavy vehicles.

RTX Tech Research Center with UConn (East Hartford) — $3.3M

Designing a low-NOx ammonia combustor for advanced power plants.

Calcify LLC (Fairfield) — $3.03M

Developing carbon-sequestering blended cement that absorbs CO₂ during production.

FuelCell Energy (Danbury) — $3.0M

Developing reversible solid oxide fuel cells that can produce electricity or generate hydrogen for storage.

RTX Corporation (East Hartford) — $2.64M

Improving membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for hydrogen fuel cells.

University of Connecticut (Storrs) — $2.25M

Building “PROACTIVE,” an AI tool to forecast storm damage and accelerate grid restoration.

Karpman Consulting (West Hartford) — $2.08M

Creating software to automate compliance reporting for building energy codes.

Each of these was a live, funded grant with initial DOE payments already disbursed, supporting engineers, researchers, and companies at work across the state. Termination notices cited reasons such as “not economically viable” and “not advancing U.S. energy needs,” though Democrats described the sweeping cancellations as a “mass termination policy.”

The cuts came as Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, identified as a key architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 initiative to consolidate federal power in the executive branch, played a central role in implementing funding freezes and cancellations and publicly signaled aggressive measures regarding federal workforce management.

Just hours before the shutdown, Connecticut House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-Branford, reportedly urged Democrats to avoid the shutdown if they wanted to prevent President Donald Trump from gaining expanded control.

“I think the other piece of this the Democrats should be concerned about is I think it does shift a lot of authority to the president,” Candelora said.

Attorney General William Tong, who has filed 33 lawsuits against the Trump administration, said Connecticut would not accept the cuts. Just hours before the Oct. 1 terminations, a federal court handed Tong a victory on energy funding, striking down the administration’s attempt to cap reimbursements for “indirect” and “fringe” costs on state energy programs. The court ruled the policy unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires agencies to follow fair and consistent procedures.

“This is about protecting Connecticut’s right to chart its own clean energy future,” Tong said after the ruling. “We will fight these cuts the same way — and we will win.”

On Friday, the state’s Congressional delegation issued an equally defiant statement.

“These cancellations are a craven and illegal attempt by the Trump Administration to bully blue states like Connecticut, and we have one simple message for them: it’s not going to work,” according to the statement. “All this reckless and shortsighted announcement does is cut good paying jobs for people in Connecticut, raise energy costs for families, and hurt our economy. While Trump and his cronies make life harder for Americans, we are fighting as a delegation to lower household utility bills and to invest in energy independence.”",https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fuelcell-de-20251003-1200x900-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 20:00:00.942786

In conclusion, while Rivian's sales continue to struggle, the company remains a significant player in the electric vehicle market.","Rivian's sales continue to struggle despite the growing electric vehicle market. The company, which was once hailed as a leader in the space, has failed to meet expectations. Rivian's sales have been lackluster, and the company has yet to turn a profit. Despite this, Rivian remains a player in the electric vehicle market, with a strong lineup of vehicles and a commitment to innovation. However, the company's sales woes are a major concern for investors and the industry as a whole.

Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN.O) has reported a nearly 32% surge in third-quarter deliveries, beating analysts' estimates, as U.S. buyers rushed to secure tax credits before their expiry by buying new electric vehicles. Despite this surge, the company's sales remain a concern for investors and the industry as a whole, with Rivian yet to turn a profit despite the growing electric vehicle market Rivian tops quarterly delivery estimates as sales jump before tax credit expiry[ 1 ].

The expiration of federal EV tax credits on Tuesday has added to the uncertainty surrounding Rivian's future. Analysts had predicted a significant drop in EV sales and leasing after the tax credit ended, but the rush to purchase EVs before the deadline preceded the fall. Rivian delivered 13,201 vehicles in the third quarter, compared to an estimate of 12,690 vehicles, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha Rivian tops quarterly delivery estimates as sales jump before tax credit expiry[ 1 ].

Rivian's struggles are not limited to the expiration of tax credits. The company has faced high tariffs on auto parts, which have pushed up manufacturing costs and compressed margins. These duties have forced carmakers to reorganize supply chains and reduce foreign dependency, a policy emphasized by the Trump administration. The rise in vehicle costs could cause Rivian's margins to take a hit, particularly as the company aims to boost profitability ahead of the rollout of its more affordable R2 SUVs next year Rivian tops quarterly delivery estimates as sales jump before tax credit expiry[ 1 ].

Rivian's business model, centered on the design, development, and manufacturing of electric vehicles, has seen mixed results. The company's revenue is primarily generated from the production and sale of new electric vehicles, with a growing suite of software and services contributing to its revenue. However, the company continues to grapple with profitability and high cash burn, despite achieving its first-ever positive gross profit earlier in 2025 Rivian Automotive Inc.: Navigating the Electric Frontier Amidst Shifting Tides[ 2 ].

Rivian's stock performance since its IPO on November 10, 2021, has been a mixed bag. The company's shares opened at $106.75 and closed its first day at $107.50, but have since fluctuated significantly. Despite the company's struggles, Rivian remains a significant player in the electric vehicle market, with a strong lineup of vehicles and a commitment to innovation Rivian Automotive Inc.: Navigating the Electric Frontier Amidst Shifting Tides[ 2 ].

Rivian's future depends on its ability to navigate the shifting tides of the electric vehicle market. The company's strategic moves, such as the groundbreaking of a new multi-billion dollar manufacturing facility in Georgia and the anticipated launch of the more affordable R2 SUV in 2026, are critical for its future trajectory. However, concerns persist regarding Amazon's potential diversification of its EV fleet and ongoing product recalls and investigations Rivian Automotive Inc.: Navigating the Electric Frontier Amidst Shifting Tides[ 2 ].

In conclusion, while Rivian's sales continue to struggle, the company remains a significant player in the electric vehicle market.

It is the program’s 30th anniversary. The awards recognize extraordinary contributions in the arts, the environment, and the economy.

Sacoby Wilson, Ph.D., is one of the recipients being honored for his work on the environment. Wilson is an environmental health scientist and a leader in environmental justice. He’s the Director of The Health, Environmental, and Economic Justice Lab, or T.H.E. EJ Lab, at the University of Maryland. The Allegheny Front’s Kara Holsopple spoke with Sacoby Wilson about the award and his approach to environmental health and justice.

Kara Holsopple: Thank you for speaking with me, and congratulations on your Heinz Award.

Sacoby Wilson: Thank you. It’s great to be a winner of the 30th Heinz Awards. And it’s pretty overwhelming, quite humbling. Actually, when they called me, I literally cried, which I normally don’t do. But it is a huge deal. It is great when you’re honored for your work and with all the things that are happening in the country, the anti-environmental justice sentiment, this not just a recognition for me, but a recognition for the entire environmental justice movement. That we are on the right path, that we are doing God’s work, and that we’re having impact. So, it’s a great honor for me.

Kara Holsopple: Tell me a little bit about the work that T.H.E. EJ Lab does. What’s your mission?

Sacoby Wilson: Our mission is to do research that supports communities that are experiencing environmental justice issues. There are many communities around the country, populations due to their race or income, who tend to have a higher burden of environmental hazards, things like landfills, power plants.

What we do is provide scientific, technical assistance to those communities. One of my main buckets of work is really air quality monitoring. We build a lot of hyperlocal air quality monitor networks, and we do what we call community-based monitoring. Community members live in places with these stationary or mobile sources of pollution. They are the contextual experts. They have the lived experience; they know what’s going on. We want to make sure the monitoring is responsive to their needs and concerns.

We’ve done monitoring in Charleston, South Carolina, around the port expansion in North Charleston. We’ve done monitoring in Prince George’s County Schools, trying to educate young people about air pollution in their schools, to help empower them, educate them so they can do something about it. That’s one of our biggest areas of work is really helping communities get the tools and the data around air quality so they can translate to action.

[O]ne of our biggest areas of work is really helping communities get the tools and the data around air quality so they can translate to action.

Kara Holsopple: What’s your philosophy on engaging residents in your work, and what does that look like on the ground?

Sacoby Wilson: You know, early on in my career, usually community groups or residents would get to know us through a green group. They have this environmental problem or environmental health issue, and so initially they would contact the Sierra Club or a group like that. Then it would be like a referral process. But over time now people really got to know the EJ Lab and the work that we do. People contact us directly.

Most of the work that we do when it comes to engaging residents is in collaboration with a local grassroots organization. In many cases, they’re reacting to building a new facility. That’s usually what happens, or a facility is getting a permit. We built this network in the region where grassroots organizations are working together. Grassroots organizations are working with academic partners.

We also have community-university partnerships where communities are helping to build the study design. They develop the research questions, help drive the study, design, etc. So a lot of it is really ground-up research. They are working with partners like us, partners that they trust. And that trust has been built over years, in some cases decades of working together.

Kara Holsopple: President Trump and his administration are doing away with environmental justice funding, staffing and initiatives in the federal government. They are also targeting universities that work on racial and other disparities. What impact does or will that have on your work and others in the field?

Sacoby Wilson: It’s had a tremendous negative impact. We’ve had grants that I would say have been illegally terminated on the university side. I am, I was going to say was, but I am the co-director of the U.S. EPA Region 3 TCTAC. That’s the Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center. The idea behind this center is to provide technical assistance for front-line, fence-line groups that are impacted by environmental and justice issues to build a capacity to apply for funding, including federal grants.

It’s been a huge negative impact of the administration when it comes to the illegal termination grants, and shutting down the programs like the Community Change Grant Program. I think the Community Change Grant Program, was a $2 billion fund, probably one of the EPA’s best programs in its history.

That program would have provided monies, in some cases, $20 million for collaborations to look at climate action strategies. So think about putting in EV charging stations, putting in solar, training folks in how to do HVAC, putting in green infrastructure, tracking reduction of greenhouse gases, and those important co-pollutants like particulate matter. Improving people’s lives and also providing jobs.

But guess what? The EJ movement is about people and what can be disassembled could be reassembled.

That would have had many co-benefits and dividends, so that $20 million investment could have led to $100 million of return of co-benefits because of reducing pollution, improving health outcomes, and providing jobs. So you’re saving lives, saving money, and creating opportunity. That was a beautiful program. I think that’s a loss for the country. Many of the grants that have been canceled also impacted rural, low-income, white residents, and impacted folks who already had a lack of access to good infrastructure in rural areas.

Also, the dismantling of the environmental justice infrastructure at the federal level. The hard work of folks in the Office of Environmental Justice. A small but mighty team in the EPA for years that was really not provided the support until the last [EPA] administrator, Administrator Regan. [He was] probably the administrator who did the most on environmental justice, who really led with his heart and really provided the infrastructure and leadership. So having that infrastructure dismantled is problematic.

But guess what? The EJ movement is about people and what can be disassembled could be reassembled. So the movement, it’s not over. The movement wasn’t ended. It’s just a delay. Yes, the money is a problem, but what is the statement? The revolution will not be televised, nor will it be funded. We went for years without having money in the EJ movement and getting things done. I think it’s going to make the movement stronger because we have more power together. Let’s move forward better together in this moment.

Kara Holsopple: You’ve been in the environmental justice field for a while now. What changes have you seen in how environmental justice work is perceived and the impact that it’s made in these communities?

Sacoby Wilson: I was on the EPA, am I still on it? I’m not sure, but I was on the EPA Science Advisory Board. And for the first time at the EPA Science Advisory Board, they started focusing on environmental justice. I was part of the Fifth National Climate Assessment, a very important annual climate assessment that talks about climate change and what we need to do. We had environmental justice in the Fifth National Climate Assessment in every chapter. That’s huge.

[There’s] lot of work at the state level as well when it comes to building programs, initiatives, and passing legislation and policies that really help to advance environmental justice and address environmental injustices.

You see academic institutions focusing more on environmental justice. You still don’t have a lot of degree programs yet, which I think is problematic. But you see more classes, more people doing research. And also, there are many more nonprofits out there doing environmental justice work.

You have a lot of alliances and networks around the country where folks have come together. You see more community-based groups focusing on environmental justice, and you’re seeing more networks, alliances, coalitions coming together to really push on environmental justice. That’s been a change. And then you also see more intersectional work with climate change, reproductive justice, others. I think people see what environmental justice is as a framework.

And also you’re seeing more policy change. Let me not forget that. We’ve seen legislation across the country trying to pass at the federal level the EJ For All Act, which hasn’t passed, but I know they will keep at it, just like we kept at the Civil Rights Act.

At the state level, all the actions, of course, in California, around environmental justice, climate justice. We just had Governor Westmore over a month ago sign an executive order of environmental justice for the state of Maryland. Even in many of our red states, where you haven’t seen as much progress, some states have EJ commissions. South Carolina had an EJ commission. So you’ve seen a lot of work, not just the federal level, but a lot of work at the state level as well when it comes to building programs, initiatives, and passing legislation and policies that really help to advance environmental justice and address environmental injustices.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilson_Sacoby.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:02:23.600237

The sweeping tax and spending law passed by Trump and congressional Republicans this year canceled a federal rebate of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles, enacted by Democrats under former President Joe Biden.
To continue to spur EV adoption, Colorado will boost the incentives offered through its two-year-old Vehicle Exchange Colorado program, which provides rebates for Coloradans who trade in older, high-emitting vehicles for a new or used EV.
The state says more than 2,600 Coloradans have received rebates through the program since it launched in 2023.
“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” said CEO executive director Will Toor.","A state program to incentivize electric vehicle purchases will offer more generous rebates in the absence of federal benefits repealed by President Donald Trump’s administration, Colorado officials announced Thursday.

The sweeping tax and spending law passed by Trump and congressional Republicans this year canceled a federal rebate of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles, enacted by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. That incentive, which applied to domestically manufactured EVs, expired Sept. 30.

To continue to spur EV adoption, Colorado will boost the incentives offered through its two-year-old Vehicle Exchange Colorado program, which provides rebates for Coloradans who trade in older, high-emitting vehicles for a new or used EV.

“The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a press release. “Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost.”

“I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: get out there right now,” Polis added.

Under the state’s expanded rebates, eligible Coloradans can receive up to $9,000 towards the purchase or lease of a new EV, an increase from $6,000. The maximum incentive for a used EV was raised from $4,000 to $6,000.

To qualify for the vehicle exchange program, an applicant must trade in a gas-powered car that is at least 12 years old or fails an emissions test. Eligibility is also restricted to people with lower incomes, or who are enrolled in at least one state or federal financial assistance program. Full details are available on the Vehicle Exchange Colorado website.

The state says more than 2,600 Coloradans have received rebates through the program since it launched in 2023. The EV rebate program is one of several supported by the Community Access Enterprise, funded through new fees on gasoline sales, EV registrations, rideshare vehicles and more under a major 2021 overhaul of state transportation funding. The EV trade-in program is funded through at least 2032.

Overall, the expiration of consumer rebates and other clean energy programs under Trump and congressional Republicans is projected to cost the average Colorado household $500 a year by 2035, Polis’ office has said.

Officials with the Colorado Energy Office told lawmakers in August that it now projects fewer than 600,000 electric vehicles will be on Colorado’s roads by 2030, far short of the goal of nearly 1 million it first set in 2019. Fully electric vehicles have accounted for just under 20% of all new vehicle sales in the first half of 2025, a decline from their peak market share in the second half of 2024, according to the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association.

“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” said CEO executive director Will Toor. “Coloradans have made it clear that they want EVs, and with Congress revoking key incentives that save Coloradans money, we are stepping up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/electric-vehicle-charging-coloradocollege-092721-1024x7681759520639.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=zPVmUP7E,N,,2025-10-03 18:03:42.134750

“Given the harm coke ovens’ emissions cause to communities, we are gratified to see EPA acknowledge that these facilities can and should meet emissions standards now,” said Adrienne Lee, Earthjustice senior attorney.
“These coke ovens emit benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and many other toxic air pollutants; it is long past time that they took every effort to reduce these emissions.”","—

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed course on their plans to delay air pollution compliance for coke oven plants, after Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit on behalf of a coalition of clean air and community public health advocacy groups.

In western Pennsylvania, northwest Indiana, Ohio, Alabama and other states, coke ovens – which burn coal to produce a hard deposit that facilities use to make steel – emit lead, mercury, benzene, and other hazardous, cancer-causing air pollutants. In 2024, EPA finalized updates to the emissions standards for these toxic facilities after years of delay, which required monitoring for benzene in nearby communities and set caps on previously unregulated emissions. But in July of this year, in a move that catered to corporate pressure, Trump’s EPA issued an interim final rule, delaying compliance until July 2027.

The group’s lawsuit challenged EPA’s interim final rule, as it deprived nearby residents and communities of protection against toxic air pollution. Rather than defend the interim final rule in litigation, EPA reversed course. In a brief filed with the D.C. Circuit, EPA now affirms its prior finding that coke ovens are fully capable of complying with the 2024 rule, thereby acknowledging that the delay of compliance dates was never needed.

“Given the harm coke ovens’ emissions cause to communities, we are gratified to see EPA acknowledge that these facilities can and should meet emissions standards now,” said Adrienne Lee, Earthjustice senior attorney. “We hope that EPA will reconsider its similarly unjustified action in delaying air standards at steel mills, many of which are located in the same communities as coke ovens.”

Quotes from our clients and partners

“It is good news that that the Trump EPA is abandoning its unlawful attempt to delay the compliance deadlines for recently updated air pollution control rules for steel industry coke ovens,” said Haley Lewis, attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project. “Communities living near these facilities waited many years for these rules to be finalized by EPA in 2024 and putting them into action now is vital for reducing hazardous air pollution and protecting people living near these plants.”

“We welcome EPA’s withdrawal of its proposal to weaken the Biden-era coke oven rule,” said Jilisa Milton, executive director of Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution. “For our communities living near Bluestone Coke and ABC Coke, keeping stronger protections in place is another important step toward safeguarding public health after years of experiencing the effects of toxic pollution.”

“We fought for years to get these national regulations passed so that our communities would be better protected from the toxic pollutants that spew from coke oven facilities,” said Abby Jones, vice president of legal and policy at PennFuture. “While we fought against the Trump Administration’s efforts to delay their implementation, we are pleased that EPA has reconsidered its actions in light of the massive public response opposing the delay and the fact that the companies can comply within the original deadline. Allowing the 2024 coke oven regulations to take effect as originally planned will save countless lives and will provide much needed protection for frontline communities in Pennsylvania.”

“For communities hosting these coke ovens, today sees the withdrawal of a misguided attempt to excuse these terrible polluting facilities from the duty to reduce their cancer-causing emissions,” said Jane Williams, chair of the Sierra Club National Clean Air Team. “These coke ovens emit benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and many other toxic air pollutants; it is long past time that they took every effort to reduce these emissions.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-03 17:02:11.732604

That's more than any other GM plant — though Oshawa won its most recent award in 2013.
The Oshawa plant has a highly skilled workforce that makes GM a highly profitable truck, Gray says.
Ideally, he says it would be great if GM were to retool the Oshawa plant to build EVs.","General Motors has employed workers in Oshawa for generations. So while its presence in the city has been declining for decades, GM still looms large culturally, as hundreds of workers are expected to be laid off in the plant in the new year.

GM began its Canadian operations in Oshawa back in 1918. The auto giant has said it's working on a plan to keep building in Oshawa for another 100 years.

But in the face of U.S. auto tariffs, what's the future of the plant? Here's what we've been hearing during our reporting on the looming layoffs.

GM will still build trucks

As first announced in 2023, GM is spending $280 million to build the next generation of Chevrolet Silverados in Oshawa.

The associated plant upgrades are currently underway, spokesperson Ariane Pereira said in an email.

WATCH | Some 2,000 workers will be laid off when GM cuts a shift in the new year:

How GM’s job cuts in Oshawa loom large over one worker

September 29Duration4:25Oshawa native Todd Forbes is one of some 2,000 workers who are set to be laid off in January when General Motors cuts the third shift at its Oshawa, Ont., plant. Some are considering moving elsewhere, amid high unemployment rates in the city and an auto industry under threat from U.S. tariffs.

The plant currently makes heavy and light-duty Chevy Silverados on the same line — the only GM plant to do so, according to the company's website.

You might think it seems contradictory that GM is committing to building new trucks in Oshawa despite cutting a shift next year. But the additional product mandate is a really good sign for the plant's future, says Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian business history at the University of Toronto.

That's going to be a huge boost in confidence, he said.

GM is moving production from Oshawa to Indiana. Here's what they're saying across the border (new window)

Even if it does go down to two shifts, you've got a guarantee for the foreseeable future of significant production, which means significant employment, Anastakis said.

Chris Waugh, Unifor chairperson for the Oshawa plant, said he wouldn't comment on the impact of this production on workers.

Employment peaked in 1980s

CBC News has heard from some readers who say GM jobs are not important for Oshawa anymore. They've argued the city's auto industry has been in decline for decades, and the city has moved onto other industries, including health care and technology.

It's true the plant has dwindled in size over the past several decades, going from a peak of 23,000 employees in the 1980s to some 3,000 employees now.

Today, manufacturing industries only employ about three per cent of Oshawa's workforce, city data shows.

But the GM plant is still a major employer of well-paying jobs with benefits, says Jeff Gray, president of Unifor Local 222, which represents the workers.

Here's the autoworkers' case

Oshawa autoworkers also appear to be good at their jobs. The plant has won 9 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study awards, which study new vehicle quality. That's more than any other GM plant — though Oshawa won its most recent award in 2013.

It's also worth noting that pick up trucks — or as Anastakis puts it, big gas guzzling vehicles — continue to be in high demand in North America.

The Oshawa plant has a highly skilled workforce that makes GM a highly profitable truck, Gray says.

We make [GM] a lot of money, he says. We've been doing that for several decades.

Our business case is great, Gray says, and it's not just him trying to make this case. He says Lana Payne, Unifor's national president, is pressing the federal government to come to a trade agreement with the U.S. that would put Canadian auto workers back on a level playing field.

CBC News has also heard that representatives from all levels of government are in regular talks with GM.

Building military vehicles is on the table

One possibility for the Oshawa plant is it could begin building military vehicles — and there is some precedent for this.

In July 2024, the Canadian military awarded GM Defense Canada a $35.8-million contract to build 90 light tactical vehicles — although they were built in North Carolina, according to media reports.

GM says it cannot comment on future product planning in Oshawa for competitive reasons. Oshawa Mayor Dan Carter also declined to provide details on his meetings with GM and the provincial and federal government.

GM increasing production in Indiana as it cuts hundreds of jobs in Oshawa

October 1Duration4:52General Motors has added 250 temporary jobs to its plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., as it prepares to cut hundreds of jobs in Oshawa in the new year. CBC's Christian D'Avino visited Fort Wayne to learn more about where these jobs are going.

But the mayor did say he thinks there is an opportunity for the Oshawa plant to make military vehicles, which it did during the Second World War.

We want to make a case that the workforce, the technology, the lines, the history is here, and we can meet whatever demands that they're looking for, Carter told CBC News.

Still, awarding a military contract would be less of a solution and more of a possible bone thrown to the plant, says Greg Layson, digital and mobile editor at Automotive News Canada.

You're never going to make 60,000 military vehicles a year the way you make 60,000 pick-ups per year, he says. But it's some work on some level at some factories in Ontario.

Could Oshawa become a hub for EVs?

The auto industry as a whole is transitioning toward electric vehicles (EVs), Anastakis says. Ideally, he says it would be great if GM were to retool the Oshawa plant to build EVs.

But, he says U.S. President Donald Trump's policies have hurt this transition towards EVs (new window), putting North American companies behind Chinese and European automakers. Chinese manufacturers are far and away the leaders in EVs, says Greig Mordue, an associate professor of engineering at McMaster University and former Toyota Canada executive.

The world is going electric, and Canada is at a hinge point, he says.

We can continue to coddle the Big Three [Ford, General Motors and Stellantis] that make about one vehicle in Canada for every two or three they sell, or we can embrace the new manufactures and take a more global outlook, Mordue says.

Canada placed a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles last year. The federal government has faced calls to lift these tariffs and is looking at the possibility of doing so (new window), despite concerns from Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

But Chinese EVs are more affordable than other EVs because most are made by state-backed automakers with cheap labour under questionable labour practices, Layson says.

Most of the factories are powered by coal fired power plants that generate electricity, he says.

Letting in Chinese-made EVs would also undercut the North American auto industry, as these automakers are trying to build out their own EV infrastructure and produce affordable EVs, Layson said.

You have to ask yourself if you are willing to cut the tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, at what cost? he said.

It's not just monetary. It's moral, it's ethical and it's environmental.","https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_635/v1/ici-info/16x9/general-motors-third-shift-cut.png",N,,2025-10-03 17:02:33.230720

The change is really happening for the Jewel Streets.”","For decades, residents of a neighborhood that straddles the border of Brooklyn and Queens have dealt with the unique effects of living in a basin: swampy flooding, bumpy streets, overgrown lots strewn with trash and leaky septic tanks — because homes are not connected to the city sewer system.

With roads named for Amber, Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald, what some locals call the Jewel Streets area may be better known as The Hole. It’s a neighborhood unlike any other.

And it is now unique in another way: It’s becoming the first place in the five boroughs where the New York City government will offer to buy flood-prone homes from homeowners — proactively, instead of in response to a disaster.

The Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice on Friday will begin collecting information from homeowners possibly interested in the city purchasing their property, including one- to four-unit homes and vacant lots.

For some locals, the possibility of selling their homes and no longer dealing with the conditions in the neighborhood comes as a relief.

“I’ve had enough,” said Bart Aclin, a retired Fire Department inspector who has owned his home there for nearly 25 years. “I’d rather just sell the property, if they give us fair market value, what they claim the property is worth. We’ll see.”

Under the shadow of leafy trees, Aclin’s home is at one of the lowest points in the neighborhood. He loves the quiet seclusion. He has an above-ground pool in the backyard, and he feeds four stray cats daily. But even on a dry autumn day this week, pumps continually moved water from his permanently soggy basement through a tangle of hoses into the overgrown lot next door.

“I don’t really want to leave, but it’s getting to that point,” Aclin said.

While homeowners can raise their hands for a possible offer from the city, there’s no guarantee it’ll come through. The city will consider if the property could fulfill a particular use in the context of new development and drainage upgrades in the neighborhood. For instance, the city could turn the land into park space or a community garden, put pumps or stormwater storage systems on it, or build new, flood-resilient housing.

The Resilient Acquisitions program, as the new effort is called, is intended to be “a resilience strategy that preserves as much housing as possible and ideally expands it by using properties that are acquired to defend other parts of their neighborhood,” said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala.

Moving On

Acquiring property like the city is proposing in The Hole is a type of climate change adaptation known as managed retreat, where people, buildings and equipment move away from flood risks. But with the city’s housing crisis, taking places to live out of service is a thorny endeavor, and can have ripple effects throughout longstanding communities.

“We’ve designed a program that does really allow for us to have the targeted and necessary community conversation acquiring homes around flooding,” said Paul Lozito, deputy executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice.

After interested homeowners submit a form to the city, they can expect to get a call back in about two weeks’ time, he said. Then various agencies will talk to each other as well as to local individuals and community groups about uses for the land. Once the city decides what can be done with the property, homeowners can formally apply to sell their homes or lots.

Case managers will work with both property owners and tenants living in the buildings to help them move.

Making It Work

The Hole, sandwiched between East New York, Brooklyn, and Lindenwood, Queens, was built on top of marshland and has long dealt with neglect.

Even drizzles could cause standing puddles in the middle of streets, which attracted mosquitoes and made getting around difficult. Many homes aren’t hooked up to the city sewer system and rely on septic tanks, which also overflow when it rains. Floodwaters have at times seeped into or frozen gas lines, cutting off heat to homes.

Residents took matters into their own hands. They jerry-rigged a series of makeshift pumps to get water out of the street, and in some places, paved their own sidewalks. They invested tens of thousands of dollars in their homes to create protection from floods, and repair things when the water comes.

Some homeowners like Julisa Rodriguez have been advocating for many years for the city to buy them out. Now that that could happen, she’s both excited and a bit sad when she considers the uncertainty ahead.

“It’s a lot to think about. It’s really a lot,” she said. “I was surprised myself. I thought, ‘Aren’t you supposed to be happy, jumping through the roof?’”

Rodriguez said she’d have to figure out where to move, keeping in mind the schooling of her two kids, ages 5 and 10. On a recent sunny afternoon, they rode their bikes and played basketball in the front yard. Rodriguez called the area her oasis.

But she’s haunted by a memory from a decade ago of being pregnant with her son and the first floor flooding so badly she had to decamp to a hotel and then renovate. She said she recently got her house appraised and learned it was worth $1.3 million. How much the city can offer will determine her next steps, she said.

“I’m hoping that the city is fair and just. I think we do deserve it,” she said.

Floating Hope

The new program is designed to cope with not just coastal flooding — water comes from the ocean or bays during storms, which New York saw during Superstorm Sandy — but stormwater flooding, too, or what happens when the skies open up.

The environmental protection agency singled out the Jewel Streets area as one of 86 places in the city that need significant interventions because of stormwater flooding. And they came up with several ideas to fix it over the years.

The agency considered redoing the entire neighborhood’s sewer system, and connecting it to the rest of the city, but that would mean elevating streets up so high that they would bury the front doors of some homes. The city has also floated building a bluebelt — an engineered enhancement of a natural watershed to store and channel stormwaters — but would need more property to do so.

The city’s Housing Preservation and Development agency is working to create a neighborhood plan for the 12 blocks of the Jewel Streets area, as well as the surrounding, wider area that’s wedged between Conduit Avenue and Shore Parkway.

Along with other agencies — including the transportation and sanitation departments — the plan aims to better connect the streets, reduce flooding and develop new housing and open space. Already, agencies have cleaned up refuse that was dumped in some empty lots and began towing abandoned cars. The DEP in 2023 installed new storm sewers and catch basins, which residents said helped to cut down on the standing water.

While the acquisition program is limited to the Jewel Streets area for now, it may expand to other flood-prone neighborhoods as funding becomes available. The city will choose the areas based on where other strategies for preventing or protecting against flooding aren’t physically or financially feasible.

The Adams administration had proposed exploring an acquisition program for flood-prone properties in 2023 as part of the annual citywide sustainability report. That idea was built upon work from the de Blasio administration, which floated buying up properties soon after the floodwaters of 2021’s Hurricane Ida ravaged several low-lying neighborhoods. Some residents of repeatedly deluged homes in Hollis, Queens, asked the city for buyouts, but have never seen offers.

The government has bought out homes in flooded neighborhoods before, but all were done in response to Hurricane Sandy. And they were limited to certain coastal neighborhoods in Queens — including Edgemere on the Rockaway Peninsula — and in Staten Island, including in Midland Beach and Oakwood Beach.

That the Jewel Streets area would be the focus of the city’s first proactive buyout program was “awesome,” said Debra Ack, a member and co-founder of the East New York Community Land Trust, a community group that has been working with the residents since 2021 to push for improvements.

Ack was in a working group convened in 2023 to figure out how a buyout program could be part of the city’s strategy to become “rainproof,” and pushed for the neighborhood to be considered.

“This way you can condemn the land, make it undevelopable and put some nature back there,” Ack said. “It will still take time. At least we know it’s in the works, it’s doable now. The change is really happening for the Jewel Streets.”",https://www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1E2A2371-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 16:02:06.681244

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Ford Motor Co. and General Motors have developed a method through the IRS guidance to extend use of the electric vehicle tax credits, at least for leases, into the fourth quarter.

The Detroit automakers used their financing arms, called captive finance companies, to make down payments on EVs before finding customers, a move that allows those vehicles to qualify for the incentives beyond the Sept. 30 expiration.

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Stellantis has not publicly announced a similar program. In a statement, the company said it “will continue to be aggressive in the marketplace to support our customers and future customers considering an electrified option.”

Tax credit eligibility applies to retail leases only, according to documents outlining Ford's program obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Electric vehicle purchases and fleet vehicles do not apply.

Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters at a media event Sept. 30 that the automaker worked to implement the program because he believes the EV owner base is important for the automaker's future.

“We don't want to have a hole in our owner base because we have a lot of customers that are driving our electric vehicles,” he said. “So I think there's a period of time when we'll have to transition consumers out of the government's support. But as far as how long we do that, and how deep we do it, you know, we'll see.”

GM's program is similarly structured to Ford's, according to a GM spokesman. When a customer leases an EV through the program, their payment reflects application of the tax credit and the finance company gets reimbursed.

Both Ford and GM offered dealers $1,000 per vehicle in dealer cash to participate, according to GM spokesman Jim Cain. The credit will be available as long as there is inventory covered by the program, the GM spokesman said.

In a statement, a Ford spokesperson said that through the program, the automaker “is working to provide Ford electric vehicle shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31. “

President Donald Trump’s July legislation, called the Big Beautiful Bill, eliminated the President Joe Biden-era federal $7,500 tax credit on new EV sales and leases originating after Sept. 30.

The credit remained viable, the IRS said last month, if a vehicle is “placed in service” after Sept. 30, so long as a payment has been made on the vehicle.

“If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” per the guidance.

The IRS clarified a payment may include “a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in” and that the guidance applies to the federal commercial clean vehicle tax credit, which permitted automakers to pass on the $7,500 incentive to car buyers through a lease.

How it works:

Dealers opting in to the program received a $1,000 incentive per vehicle.

The automakers' financing arms selected vehicles with VIN numbers, meaning on participating dealer lots or in transit, and applied a payment toward them before the deadline. That payment is a percentage of the MSRP, but a spokesman would not provide specifics.

When the dealer actually writes the lease for the customer, the customer gets the value of the tax credit in the lease calculation.

The credit company gets paid back for its rebate, or down payment.

“The whole idea here is, it’s business as usual for the customer,” according to the GM spokesman. “Hypothetically, they can walk in on Oct. 1 or Oct. 31 and lease an EV and get the benefit of the credit if the dealer is participating in the program and still has inventory. It’s while supplies last.”

The GM spokesman also would not break out inventory, except to say, “We’ll be able to meet customer demand well into the fourth quarter.”

The Global Residential Solar Energy Storage Market size is expected to be worth around USD 292.1 Billion by 2034, from USD 51.3 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 19.0% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024 North America held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 44.2% share, holding USD 22.6 Billion in revenue.

The residential solar energy storage segment refers to battery systems co-located at homes with rooftop PV to shift, store, or firm up solar power for consumption later. As solar additions accelerate globally, pairing storage at the household level is increasingly viewed as essential for enabling self-consumption, resilience, and grid flexibility. In the U.S., for example, more than 28% of all new residential solar capacity in 2024 was paired with storage, up from under 12% in 2023.

The industrial scenario is characterized by rapid scaling of both utility and distributed storage, with policy and fiscal incentives playing a determinative role. Behind-the-meter residential batteries are expanding as part of broader battery deployment growth highlighted by international agencies; utility-scale battery capacity in the United States, for example, exceeded 26 GW in 2024 after a 10.4 GW increase during the year, illustrating the acceleration of battery deployment across segments and the technology spill-over that benefits residential adopters.

Key driving factors include cost reductions in battery cells and system integration, policy incentives, grid reliability concerns, and consumer demand for energy resilience. Fiscal support has materially affected uptake: the United States Residential Clean Energy Credit provides a 30% tax credit for qualifying home clean energy property through 2032, which has directly improved the economic case for pairing rooftop PV with home batteries. Such incentives have been complemented by declining levelised costs for solar and storage technologies, enabling shorter payback horizons for many owner-occupied properties.

The government programs and manufacturing scale are shaping residential storage prospects. India reported notable rooftop solar expansion—with rooftop capacity reaching approximately 17.02 GW within a total solar capacity of roughly 105.65 GW—supported by national schemes and enhanced module manufacturing; this expansion creates a substantive addressable market for residential storage solutions as residential and small commercial consumers seek to maximize on-site utilization.

Government and regulatory initiatives play a pivotal role in shaping uptake. In India, the government has introduced a viability gap funding (VGF) scheme worth ₹ 91 billion (US $1.09 billion) to support 43.2 GWh of battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, and a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) program to support manufacturing of 50 GWh of advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries with a budgetary outlay of ₹181 billion.

Further, India has proposed to escalate its VGF target to 13.2 GWh for subsidized battery capacity by June 2027. The government also mandates a rising “energy storage obligation” for entities like distribution utilities, growing from 1% in FY 2023–24 to 4% by FY 2029–30.

Additionally, under India’s 2024 budget, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana with an investment of ₹ 75,021 crore targets to deploy rooftop solar systems for about 1 crore households along with 300 free units of electricity per month—a move that may indirectly stimulate rooftop-plus-storage adoption.

Emerging Trends

Rising Pairing of Solar with Storage

One of the clearest and most powerful trends playing out right now in residential solar energy storage is how often new home solar systems are now being installed together with battery storage—rather than solar standing alone. Homeowners are increasingly seeing that adding a battery makes their rooftop solar more valuable, by shifting usage from daytime to evening, backing up during outages, and giving flexibility to manage energy costs.

In the U.S., for example, more than 28% of all new residential solar capacity installed in 2024 was paired with storage. That is a big jump from under 12% in 2023. This sharp rise shows that households are buying the idea of coupling storage with PV—not just as an add-on, but as part of the core system. It’s an important signal: solar is no longer just about capturing sunlight, but also about using it when you need it.

Behind that trend are a few intersecting forces. First, battery costs continue to drop. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), for a typical 5 kW / 12.5 kWh residential battery system, capital expenditure (CAPEX) is projected to fall by 17 % to 52 % between 2022 and 2035 under various innovation scenarios. As storage becomes cheaper, the incremental cost of putting one together with solar shrinks, making the pairing more attractive.

Second, changes in tariff structures, net-metering rules, and self-consumption incentives are pushing homeowners to maximize their own use of solar power rather than sending it to the grid. More utilities and regulators are imposing time-of-use rates, demand charges, or stricter export limits. These shifts make it more economical to store the excess solar rather than export it at low rates.

Thirdly, the trend is reinforced by government incentives and subsidy programs that encourage storage adoption. While I found detailed residential-storage incentives most clearly in regions like Germany and Australia (e.g. in Germany home battery sales are expected to grow 26% in 2024, pushing battery ownership from 1.2 million to possibly 2.0 million homes) , such programs validate for consumers that storage is a serious and supported technology.

Drivers

Cost Decline and Improved Affordability

One of the biggest and most human-relatable driving factors in the residential solar energy storage sector is the steep decline in battery costs, which makes these systems more affordable for regular households. Over the past decade, the price per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for lithium-ion battery systems has dropped dramatically. Around 2010, these batteries cost about US $1,100 per kWh; by 2020, that had fallen to around US $137 per kWh. This kind of sharp descent in cost makes it much less of a stretch for a typical household to consider installing a storage system alongside rooftop solar panels.

In India’s context, the government has recognized this driver and is actively fostering it. The Government of India has committed ₹91 billion (~US $1.09 billion) as viability gap funding (VGF) to support 43.2 GWh of battery energy storage deployment. Additionally, a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme with outlay of ₹181 billion (~US $2,181 million) aims to support manufacturing of 50 GWh of advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries. These policies help reduce the cost burden at the production or installation side, and pass a portion of that benefit to end users.

Also, the government is removing some extra cost barriers. For example, India has extended the waiver on inter-state transmission system (ISTS) charges for battery storage projects until June 2028, especially for battery systems co-located with renewable plants. That kind of waiver trims another “hidden tax” on stored or transported energy, making battery systems relatively cheaper.

Restraints

High Upfront Cost and Financing Barriers

One major restraining factor that often stands in the way of widespread adoption of residential solar energy storage is the high initial capital cost and weak financing options. Even though battery and inverter prices have declined over the years, the total cost to set up a reliable storage system still remains substantial — enough that many households hesitate to invest in it.

In India for example, a standalone battery storage system is estimated to cost about US $203 per kWh in 2020, and is projected to fall to US $134 per kWh by 2025, and further to US $103 per kWh by 2030 (in 2018 real dollars) per a bottom-up study. These figures are for utility-scale systems, which already benefit from economies of scale; for small residential systems, the per-kWh cost tends to be significantly higher, because fixed costs (installation, permitting, balance of system) are spread over smaller capacity.

Consumers often confront a long payback period. If electricity savings or avoided grid charges don’t cover the capital cost within, say, 7–12 years (or sometimes more depending on tariffs and usage), people may simply decide it’s not worth the risk. The fear of getting locked into an expensive system, or being stuck with deteriorating battery life before full return, is real and quite human.

This upfront burden is further magnified by import dependency and duty structures. In India, a large share of lithium-ion cells and related components are imported, exposing costs to foreign exchange fluctuations, customs duty or import tariffs, and supply chain risks. In contexts where import duties, GST, or tariff adders are high, these markups inflate the consumer’s cost significantly. Some reports note that battery systems being imported can face custom duty of 20-25 %, on top of the module and component costs.

Opportunity

Participation in Aggregated Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) by Home Batteries

One of the most promising growth opportunities in residential solar energy storage lies in aggregating home battery systems into Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). In simple terms, VPPs let many households pool their storage capacity and operate that pooled resource to provide grid services like demand response, frequency regulation, or peak shaving. That way, homeowners are not just saving on their own bills — they can actually earn extra revenue, while the grid becomes more resilient.

Imagine a thousand homes, each with a 10 kWh battery. Together, they act like a small power plant of 10 MWh. Utilities or grid operators could call on that resource when they need extra energy or to balance sudden fluctuations. For the homeowner, this means monetizing otherwise idle stored energy.

This opportunity is already visible in larger markets. In the U.S., residential storage had a banner year in 2024: more than 1,250 MW of battery capacity was added in the residential segment — a 57% increase over 2023. Out of that, in Q4 alone, 380 MW was installed. That explosive growth hints at how many homes could eventually feed into VPPs. When these homeowners band together, the collective capacity becomes meaningful to utilities.

From the policy side, governments are increasingly creating programs that nudge VPP models forward. In the U.S., the Energy Storage Grand Challenge by DOE fosters research and commercialization of storage technologies, which includes frameworks for aggregation and grid integration. From the policy side, governments are increasingly creating programs that nudge VPP models forward. In the U.S., the Energy Storage Grand Challenge by DOE fosters research and commercialization of storage technologies, which includes frameworks for aggregation and grid integration.

In India, the stand-alone storage market is seeing strong momentum. In just the first quarter of 2025, tenders totaling 6.1 GW of energy storage were issued, making up 64% of all utility-scale storage tenders nationwide. While those are utility tenders, many of the policies and cost reductions that support large-scale storage also benefit behind-the-meter systems.

Regional Insights

North America leads with 44.2% share and USD 22.6 billion in 2024 for residential solar energy storage

In 2024, North America held a dominant position in the global residential solar energy storage market, capturing more than a 44.2% share, equating to approximately USD 22.6 billion in value. This leadership is primarily attributed to the United States, which accounted for the majority of the regional market share. The U.S. solar industry installed nearly 50 GW of capacity in 2024, marking a 21% increase from the previous year. This substantial growth reflects the escalating demand for residential solar energy storage solutions.

Several factors have contributed to North America’s market dominance. The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 introduced significant tax credits, including a 30% federal investment tax credit for solar-plus-storage systems, thereby reducing the upfront costs for homeowners. Additionally, states like California and Texas have been at the forefront of adopting residential energy storage, driven by strong incentives and policies promoting renewable energy integration.

The move impacts some $550 million in already-approved grants for clean energy projects across the state of Colorado.

Today, U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper released the following statement after Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director and Project 2025 author Russell Vought announced the illegal cancellation of $8 billion of federal funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) to mostly Democrat-run states:

“The cancellation of this funding for political vengeance is blatantly illegal. Congress approved this funding to create jobs and to generate cleaner, cheaper power.

“Even if for some dark reason you are against cleaner energy, these projects are well underway. To abandon them now wastes the funds already invested, and needlessly cripples dozens of honest, hard-working small businesses that believed having a legal contract with our country meant something. The White House strategy during their shutdown is to punish Americans who dared to vote against them.”

The social media post by Office of Management and Budget’ (OMB) Manager Russell Vought was not just blunt, it was almost jubilant.

Calling development of clean energy initiatives a “green new scam funding the Left’s climate agenda,” Vought announced that his office had canceled grant funding across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Hawaii, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Some 98 percent of the projects cancelled are in Democrat-run states. This is despite the fact that Republican-run states have secured over three-fourths of all BIL and IRA investments.

The funding illegally cancelled by Trump comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and congressional appropriations. This funding has been contractually obligated, with contracts already signed between the Department of Energy and companies and universities, including in Colorado, for these projects.

According to industry data, good-paying, clean energy jobs are being created at three times the rate of job creation in other fields. Some 3.6 million Americans work in clean energy across 47 clean energy subsectors. So attacking it for what certainly appears to be ideological reasons does not make economic sense

Hickenlooper was pivotal in the negotiations and passage of both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a once-in-a-generation bipartisan investment in our nation’s infrastructure, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in climate rescue in the history of the world.

Clarifying his position regarding the republican moves to “punish’ Democratic-led states for their efforts to smash clean energy investment, Hickenlooper said he will always fight back against the Trump administration’s continued attacks on Congress’ power of the purse and investments for Colorado.",https://arkvalleyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4da610e2-6ed0-4481-a343-763d6b283762.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 16:01:53.914195

This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.
Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning.
By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects.","In support of the administration’s efforts to facilitate the development of data centers, on September 15, 2025, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced at a White House artificial intelligence roundtable that the agency plans to readopt a 2017 memo issued by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (the Pruitt Memo) concerning the Clean Air Act's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program. The Pruitt Memo, which was rescinded by the Biden administration in 2022, provided that EPA would not “second-guess” pre-project emissions projections made by permit applicants and/or state permit writers, providing applicants and state permitting agencies increased latitude in determining whether certain projects triggered NSR requirements.

Though presented as an effort to cut red tape for projects powering artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and data centers, readoption of the Pruitt Memo would have implications well beyond the AI realm, including the permitting of traditional sources typically subject to NSR. By potentially streamlining NSR permitting processes and shielding certain permitting decisions from federal scrutiny, the policy change could provide entities looking to modify sources that may have otherwise been considered a major modification increased certainty and flexibility by allowing them to work dependably alongside local environmental agencies to ensure projects are below emissions permitting thresholds.

There are at least two immediate impacts of this readoption—first, entities constructing new projects will have greater flexibility in the planning for permitting a new source to reduce the burdens and impacts of the permitting process required under old NSR guidelines. For instance, under NSR regulations, for existing sources contemplating a modification, an Actual-to-Project-Actual Applicability (APTA) test is utilized to determine whether a proposed project triggers NSR permitting requirements. The source would provide a comparison of pre-project actual emissions with projections of post-project actual emissions to determine whether any proposed construction would result in a significant emissions increase. Under previous regulations, a facility would estimate what its actual air pollution levels would be after a proposed modification, and EPA could question any assumptions made by the facility used in estimating those post-modification actual emissions. This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.

Second, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo means EPA will not second-guess project emissions projections provided by the applicant unless there is a clear error or violation of procedural requirements, providing the source with much greater leeway in avoiding the typical NSR permitting process for new projects. Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning. Project applicants will have greater certainty with respect to the timing of the process, and it will facilitate modifications where the state permitting agency and applicant agree on the calculations demonstrating no significant emissions increases.

Ultimately, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo appears encouraging for project proponents, who should experience more flexibility in developing applications that would not trigger NSR and should be able to receive permits in less time. If EPA is essentially precluded from second-guessing the emissions estimates and subsequent decisions of state permit writers who determine whether certain projects rise to the level of a “major modification” that would require additional NSR review absent clear error, there should be more certainty in the permitting process and less time spent waiting for EPA review.

Overall, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo may provide new opportunities for entities looking to complete source modification projects to do so with increased certainty and flexibility through cooperation with local environmental agencies. By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects. This decision by EPA, which is being described as a necessary catalyst for projects powering AI infrastructure and data centers, may therefore result in shorter process for not only AI-focused projects but for the entire industrial sector.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9266_0649.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 18:03:18.960786

Ukraine reported that its defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant lost power after shelling hit a nearby substation. Backup diesel generators are keeping the damaged reactor’s containment structure stable, according to the UN atomic watchdog.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned he could order strikes on Ukrainian nuclear facilities if Kyiv continues attacks on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya plant.

Asian and European Energy Shifts

Taiwan imported $1.3 billion worth of Russian naphtha in the first half of 2025, despite sanctions and political opposition to Moscow’s war.

South Korea boosted nuclear generation by 8.7% in early 2025, nearly tripling its target growth.

France detained senior crew from a Russian “shadow fleet” oil tanker linked to sanctions violations and drone flights near Denmark.

The initiative from Schneider Electric includes firms like Microsoft, Zurich Resilience Solutions and Sunrock Distributed Generation. Now, along with Sustainability Partners, the groups are joining forces to support public and private sector organizations with innovative solutions and funding to strengthen energy systems that impact communities.

“Sustainability Partners is poised to play a crucial role in the success of Schneider Electric’s new Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative,” said Jason Hewitt, managing partner of infrastructure. “Our unique Infrastructure as a Service® model allows clean, reliable energy to be quickly and efficiently deployed to facilities as diverse as federal and state agencies, municipalities, airports, K-12 education facilities, police and fire stations, and hospitals.”

The objective of Schneider Electric’s Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative is to rapidly deploy resilient energy infrastructure for communities while federal incentives remain available. With the confluence of rising energy demand and aging infrastructure, along with extreme weather and potential cyber attacks, communities are facing unprecedented pressure to maintain power that is both affordable and reliable.

According to Schneider, the U.S. power grid could reach a critical inflection point in 2028, where peak electricity may no longer meet peak demand. Therefore, the Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative will reduce grid stress and energy costs by scaling distributed energy resources (DERs) like battery energy storage, solar panels and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In this way, communities can reduce reliance on the centralized grid.

“With power outages costing the U.S. economy an estimated $150 billion each year, the need for resilient energy infrastructure has never been more urgent,” said Jana Gerber, North American president of microgrids for Schneider Electric. “This initiative brings together industry leaders to accelerate the deployment of local, future-ready energy solutions, helping communities reduce risk, control costs and ensure continuity of critical services.”

Sustainability Partners (SP) is a Public Benefit Company that facilitates funding, deployment, and ongoing care of essential infrastructure to help states, municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals meet their needs. SP can help solve any combination of funding, design, engineering, procurement, installation, and maintenance of essential infrastructure with no upfront costs.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-10-03 18:15:06+00:00,Indianapolis Business Journal,Steve Eberly: Patchwork of rules stalls clean energy's growth - Indianapolis Business Journal,"Steve Eberly, Daniel Bradley, Marek Mazurek, Daniel Lee",,,,,https://www.ibj.com/articles/steve-eberly-patchwork-of-rules-stalls-clean-energys-growth,"As someone who has spent much of my career working to bring opportunities to Indiana’s rural communities, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of renewable energy.
It’s easy math to see the wind farm’s immediate impact, but it’s almost impossible to believe that an energy project could do so much for us.

In a state where too many young people feel they have had to move away to find good jobs, renewable energy is helping keep Hoosiers at home.
Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one.","As someone who has spent much of my career working to bring opportunities to Indiana’s rural communities, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of renewable energy. The conversation about wind, solar and battery storage is more than sustainability and grid diversification. It’s about more than jobs, tax revenue and keeping Indiana competitive in a rapidly changing economy. The clean-energy conversation is about how we best serve our communities, our landowners and our people.

Here in Warren County, the Jordan Creek Wind Farm has been an incredible success for keeping our government well-funded so it can better serve our residents. The project put $6.7 million into the Jordan Creek fund over the last three years for our local government. This is increasing our local tax revenue, which is funding schools, road improvements and essential services without raising property taxes on residents. Warren County’s annual operating budget for 2025 is $12.2 million. It’s easy math to see the wind farm’s immediate impact, but it’s almost impossible to believe that an energy project could do so much for us.

Clean-energy projects start generating positive outcomes for their communities as soon as they start construction, and they continue to do so for years after they begin operation.

I look at the impact that the project is having on our local generational farm landowners. In today’s economy, a corn planter can cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, and an upgrade on that machine can cost almost $100,000. The confidence that comes from knowing that the annual payment from wind farms on a farmer’s property will help offset a significant portion of those costs is remarkable.

Clean energy has the power not only to keep farms viable but also to enable them to be more profitable and to survive the current depressed grain prices. The annual land lease payment income does more than just assist in affording farm equipment. Landowners don’t have to save for years just to take a trip to see their grandchildren. That’s all thanks to the checks coming in from energy projects on their land—checks that keep coming for years over the life of a lease agreement.

These projects mean new life for rural communities that have faced decades of population decline and shrinking tax bases. During construction, these projects create hundreds of jobs, from heavy equipment operators to electricians and engineers. The operations and maintenance roles they leave behind are well-paid, stable careers that don’t require leaving your hometown. In a state where too many young people feel they have had to move away to find good jobs, renewable energy is helping keep Hoosiers at home.

We all know farming isn’t for everyone, and these types of clean-energy careers offer new options, new opportunities and new futures for those who want to stay in Indiana but can’t find an alternative vocation that allows them to support their community.

The economic benefits extend far beyond the project site. Local restaurants feed construction crews, hardware stores see more sales, and hotels stay booked. Renewable-energy development has a ripple effect that touches nearly every corner of the community.

It is frustrating that despite all these benefits, Indiana’s ability to grow its renewable energy capacity is being held back by a patchwork of local siting rules that make it unnecessarily difficult to build. Every project must navigate a maze of differing ordinances, setbacks and permitting processes under rules that can vary widely from one county to the next.

This uncertainty drives up costs, delays construction and in some cases forces projects to break ground in other states. We need a smarter approach that respects local input but also establishes clear, consistent standards that make Indiana a welcoming place for renewable investment.

Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one. Indiana farmers have been supporting our communities, state and country for decades, and these wind and solar farms are now starting to return the favor. Energy development gives me hope that Indiana will be able to continue its agriculture heritage long into the future.•

… It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.” Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center.
Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy.
Regarding fusion energy, Wright said, “We are going to see meaningful breakthroughs.” And quantum computing, he added, was going to be a “game-changer” as well.

“I’ve always been in energy because I think it’s just far and away the world’s most important industry,” Wright said at the forum, which included a panel discussion with business leaders and a fireside chat with MIT Professor Ernest Moniz, who was the U.S. secretary of energy from 2013 to 2017. Wright added: “Not only is it by far the world’s most important industry, because it enables all the others, but it’s also a booming time right now. … It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.”

Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center. While the Institute has added many research facilities and buildings since Wright was a student, Kornbluth observed, the core MIT ethos remains the same.

“MIT is still MIT,” Kornbluth said. “It’s a community that rewards merit, boldness, and scientific rigor. And it’s a magnet for people with a drive to solve hard problems that matter in the real world, an enthusiasm for working with industry, and an ethic of national service.”

When it comes to energy research, Kornbluth added, “MIT is developing transformational approaches to make American energy more secure, reliable, affordable, and clean — which in turn will strengthen both U.S. competitiveness and national security.”

At the event, Wright, the 17th U.S. secretary of energy, engaged in a fireside chat with Moniz, the 13th U.S. secretary of energy, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Post-Tenure, a special advisor to the MIT president, and the founding director of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). Wright began his remarks by reflecting on Kornbluth’s description of the Institute.

“Merit, boldness, and scientific rigor,” Wright said. “That is MIT … to me. That hit me hard when I got here, and frankly, it’s a good part of the reason my life has gone the way it’s gone.”

On energy topics, Wright emphasized the need for continued innovation in energy across a range of technologies, including fusion, geothermal, and more, while advocating for the benefits of vigorous market-based progress. Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy. He also was the founder of Pinnacle Technologies, among other enterprises. Wright was confirmed as secretary by the U.S. Senate in February.

Asked to name promising areas of technological development, Wright focused on three particular areas of interest. Citing artificial intelligence, he noted that the interest in it was “overwhelming,” with many possible applications. Regarding fusion energy, Wright said, “We are going to see meaningful breakthroughs.” And quantum computing, he added, was going to be a “game-changer” as well.

Wright also emphasized the value of federal support for fundamental research, including projects in the national laboratories the Department of Energy oversees.

“The 17 national labs we have in this country are absolute jewels. They are gems of this country,” Wright said. He later noted, “There are things, like this foundational research, that are just an essential part of our country and an essential part of our future.”

Moniz asked Wright a range of questions in the fireside chat, while adding his own perspective at times about the many issues connected to energy abundance globally.

“Climate, energy, security, equity, affordability, have to be recognized as one conversation, and not separate conversations,” Moniz said. “That’s what’s at stake in my view.”

Wright’s appearance was part of the Energy Freedom Tour developed by the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), in coordination with the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University. Later stops are planned for Stanford University and Texas A&M University.

Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute, gave remarks at the forum as well, noting the importance of making students aware of the energy industry and helping to “get them excited about the impact this career can make.” She also praised MIT’s advances in the field, adding, “This is where so many ideas were born and executed that have allowed America to really thrive in this energy abundance in our country that we have [had] for so long.”

The forum also featured remarks from Roger Martella, chief corporate officer, chief sustainability officer, and head of government affairs at GE Vernova. In March, MIT and GE Vernova announced a new five-year joint program, the MIT-GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance, featuring research projects, education programs, and career opportunities for MIT students.

“That’s what we’re about, electrification as the lifeblood of prosperity,” Martella said, describing GE Vernova’s work. “When we’re here at MIT we feel like we’re living history every moment when we’re walking down the halls, because no institution has [contributed] to innovation and technology more, doing it every single day to advance prosperity for all people around the world.”

A panel discussion at the forum featured Wright speaking along with three MIT alumni who are active in the energy business: Carlos Araque ’01, SM ’02, CEO of Quaise Energy, a leading-edge firm in geothermal energy solutions; Bob Mumgaard SM ’15, PhD ’15, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a leading fusion energy firm and an MIT spinout; and Milo Werner SM ’07, MBA ’07, a general partner at DCVC and expert in energy and climate investments. The panel was moderated by Chris Barnard, president of the ACC.

Mumgaard noted that Commonwealth Fusion Systems launched in 2018 with “an explicit mission, working with MIT still today, of putting fusion onto an industrial trajectory,” although there is “plenty left to do, still, at that intersection of science, technology, innovation, and business.”

Araque said he believes geothermal is “metric-by-metric” more powerful and profitable than many other forms of energy. “This is not a stop-gap,” he added. Quaise is currently developing its first power-plant-scale facility in the U.S.

Werner noted that the process of useful innovation only begins in the lab; making an advance commercially viable is the critical next step. The biggest impact “is not in the breakthrough,” she said. “It’s not in the discovery that you make in the lab. It’s actually once you’ve built a billion of them. That’s when you actually change the world.”

After the forum, Wright took a tour of multiple research centers on the MIT campus, including the MIT.nano facility, guided by Vladimir Bulović, faculty director of MIT.nano and the Fariborz Maseeh Chair in Emerging Technology.

At MIT.nano, Bulović showed Wright the Titan Krios G3i, a nearly room-size electron microscope that enables researchers to take a high-resolution look at the structure of tiny particles, with a variety of research applications. The tour also viewed one of MIT.nano’s cleanrooms, a shared fabrication facility used by both MIT researchers and users outside of MIT, including many in industry.

On a different note, in an MIT.nano hallway, Bulović showed Wright the One.MIT mosaics, which contain the names of all MIT students and employees past and present — well over 300,000 in all. First etched on a 6-inch wafer, the mosaics are a visual demonstration of the power of nanotechnology — and a searchable display, so Bulović located Wright’s name, which is printed near the chin of one of the figures on the MIT seal.

The tour ended in the basement of Building 10, in what is now the refurbished Grainger Energy Machine Facility, where Wright used to conduct research. After earning his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, Wright entered into graduate studies at MIT before leaving, as he recounted at the forum, to pursue business opportunities.

At the lab, Wright met with David Perreault, the Ford Foundation Professor of Engineering; and Steven Leeb, the Emanuel Landsman Professor, a specialist in power systems. A half-dozen MIT graduate students gave Wright demos of their research projects, all involving energy-generation innovations. Wright readily engaged with all the graduate students about the technologies and the parameters of the devices, and asked the students about their own careers.

Wright was accompanied on the lab tour by MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, himself an expert in developing energy-efficient systems. Chandrakasan delivered closing remarks at the forum in the Samberg Center, noting MIT’s “strong partnership with the Department of Energy” and its “long and proud history of engaging industry.”

As such, Chandrakasan said, MIT has a “role as a resource in service of the nation, so please don’t hesitate to call on us.”",https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/post-images/MIT-Energy%2520Secretary-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 16:03:50.221988

“The only change [to manufacturing policy support] is really around whether a company is deemed a foreign entity of concern, because then they can’t claim the 45X tax credit, which gives us as domestic producers a competitive advantage,” Merfeld told us.

At next week’s conference in the San Francisco Bay Area, Merfeld will lead a presentation during the event’s opening session, “PV manufacturing at a crossroads”. She will join some of the leading figures in US solar manufacturing to deliver critical insights as the domestic solar industry navigates complex policy landscapes and new growth opportunities.

One of those is Alex Zhu, CEO of US-based solar cell producer ES Foundry. Zhu told PV Tech Premium that increased policy certainty would underpin a successful US manufacturing industry. He said the clarification of safe harbour regulations for the remainder of the Investment Tax Credit’s (ITC) lifespan creates stable demand over the next three to four years. That demand allows manufacturers to plan and invest accordingly.

ES Foundry has opted to produce passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells at its US facility, bucking the international trend away from PERC towards newer, more efficient tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology. Zhu said this was down to the litigious nature of the US industry and the rise of intellectual property cases over TOPCon technology.

“I really doubt anybody can produce TOPCon cells in the US without too many legal troubles,” he told us.

Richard Rast, CEO of polysilicon producer Highland Materials, is also pursuing unique US production technology. Rast will speak in San Francisco next week about his company’s methods for innovation in the US polysilicon space, which he told us last month could produce polysilicon more sustainably and cheaper than the industry-standard Siemens process.

Policy, trade and manufacturing reality

Day one of the PV CellTech USA conference (7 October) will begin with a discussion on “Policy, trade and manufacturing reality” in the US industry.

Industry leaders and policy experts will examine the impact of recent and proposed tariff measures alongside shifts in global trade dynamics that are reshaping supply chains across the sector.

To kick off our US manufacturing interview series, PV Tech Premium spoke to MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing at the American Clean Power Association (ACP), who will be speaking next week. He said US manufacturing was “at a crossroads”, where policy and industry action could see it thrive or flounder.

In contrast with Merfeld, Shiao said the policies emerging from Washington were more damaging to manufacturers than any other part of the US industry, as their overall cooling effect on the US market could shrink the opportunities for domestic suppliers.

But much remains to be learned and worked out. With the 2023 and 2024 events selling out, PV CellTech USA has established itself as the essential gathering for understanding gigawatt-scale PV manufacturing trends in the US market. This year’s agenda addresses all aspects of the domestic manufacturing ecosystem, from policy frameworks to production realities.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Vishay Intertechnology’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 1.7% on the news that the broader semiconductor sector rallied, lifted by growing optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and positive industry news. The positive mood was partly sparked by reports that Samsung Electronics passed Nvidia's qualification tests for its high-bandwidth memory chips, a key part for AI systems. This news helped boost the entire chip sector. The move was part of a larger trend where demand linked to AI has been lifting semiconductor stocks around the world, pushing several global stock indexes to new highs. Investors chased chipmaker stocks higher as the excitement around AI continued to build.

Besides the lease rebate, Rivian is also slashing $2,000 off the price of its All-Terrain package.
Due to their high price tags, the Rivian R1S and R1T were only eligible through leasing.
The most affordable model eligible for Rivian’s rebates is the Rivian R1T Dual with the Large battery and Performance Upgrade, which retails for $82,990 excluding the destination charge.
With the $6,500 rebate factored in, the price effectively drops to $76,490, but that’s without taking into account the usual leasing fees.","Rivian is offering a credit of up to $6,500 when leasing a new R1S or R1T.

Not all vehicles are eligible for the discount, though, with the most notable absentee being the quad-motor version of the two EVs.

Besides the lease rebate, Rivian is also slashing $2,000 off the price of its All-Terrain package.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric cars is dead, but there are still some good deals to be had, as several automakers are coming up with ways to entice potential customers.

After Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, it’s Rivian’s turn to come up with something that could land it some additional buyers, albeit just by the end of this month. The American EV startup is offering a rebate of up to $6,500 for leases on certain models, but only if the customers take delivery of their new vehicles by October 31.

The biggest rebate of $6,500 applies to the 2025 R1S and R1T in three specific configurations: the tri-motor, the dual-motor with the Max battery pack and the Performance Upgrade, and the dual-motor with the Large battery and the Performance Upgrade. In other words, Rivian is trying to get rid of its inventory, but it’s worth noting that neither the entry-level Dual version with the Standard battery pack nor the top-spec Quad variant is eligible for any of these discounts.

That said, buyers can get $6,000 off the lease price of a 2026 R1S or R1T with the tri-motor configuration, while the 2026 R1S and R1T dual-motor with the Max battery and Performance Upgrade are eligible for a $5,000 lease bonus.

What’s more, Rivian is slashing $2,000 off the price of its All-Terrain Package if the customer takes delivery of a new 2025 R1S or R1T by October 31. The All-Terrain package is a paid optional extra that has a list price between $3,700 and $5,700. It comes with all-terrain tires, a spare tire, a reinforced underbody shield and extra driving modes.

To reiterate, these offers are only available for leases, not cash purchases, but it was the same story when the federal tax credit was still around. Due to their high price tags, the Rivian R1S and R1T were only eligible through leasing.

The most affordable model eligible for Rivian’s rebates is the Rivian R1T Dual with the Large battery and Performance Upgrade, which retails for $82,990 excluding the destination charge.

Venture Global’s approach of building smaller, quickly-deployed modular LNG facilities and securing long-term contracts has accelerated its rise as a leader in the U.S. LNG industry, attracting considerable attention even as it manages high debt and arbitration challenges.

We’ll explore how Venture Global’s innovative modular construction strategy is shaping its investment narrative amid rapid LNG capacity growth.

Explore leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.

What Is Venture Global's Investment Narrative?

Venture Global’s latest move to kick off construction at its CP2 export facility puts a spotlight on the bold vision that investors must believe in: rapid scaling through modular LNG plants, long-term customer deals, and capturing a leading share of US LNG exports. The company’s ambitions have always hinged on accelerating revenue streams and staying a step ahead of rivals in adding export capacity. This news moves CP2 from promise to execution and could be a near-term catalyst, particularly as it positions Venture Global toward the top spot among US LNG exporters. However, investors still face the immediate shadow of ongoing legal disputes, questions about debt service amid heavy asset buildout, and the pressure of a young, largely untested management and board guiding these moves. While analysts maintain price targets well above current levels, recent price declines and high debt suggest execution risk remains front of mind.

But beneath the growth story, investors should not ignore unresolved legal issues.

Despite retreating, Venture Global's shares might still be trading 24% above their fair value. .

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects.
Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state's hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES.
The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can't be justified.
Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican's short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.""

""I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state's hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project ""vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.""

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden's agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can't be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, another environmental group, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also ""weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace'' for innovative energy technologies, he said.

At the heart of the offer is a $7,500 rebate on BMW’s entire lineup of fully electric models.
For October, the brand is offering 2.99% APR financing for up to 60 months on a selection of its electric models.
Extending a lifeline to EV buyers helps soften the landing from the loss of federal support.
When you apply BMW’s new $7,500 rebate, the offerings are enticing.","BMW is rolling out its own set of incentives just as the federal government recently pulled the plug on electric vehicle tax credits. For customers, it means the window to still secure significant savings on a new BMW EV hasn’t closed entirely. At the heart of the offer is a $7,500 rebate on BMW’s entire lineup of fully electric models. Buyers of the i4, iX, or i7 will see that amount taken directly off the MSRP, a figure that will feel familiar to anyone who followed the federal clean vehicle credit. In many ways, BMW is stepping in to replace what Washington has now taken away.

Things are more complicated for plug-in hybrids. The new 750e xDrive sedan qualifies for a $5,000 discount, but the deal doesn’t extend to the 550e or the X5 xDrive50e, both of which remain full-price despite their popularity.

How Does The Rebate Work

There are, of course, some strings attached. The rebate is only available on vehicles financed through BMW Financial Services, and customers who lease won’t see the benefit. Delivery also has to be completed by November 1, 2025, a deadline that puts added pressure on buyers to act quickly.

On top of the purchase rebates, BMW is also making financing more attractive. For October, the brand is offering 2.99% APR financing for up to 60 months on a selection of its electric models. The deal covers several versions of the i4, including the eDrive40, xDrive40, and the high-performance M50. It also extends to the i5 M60 and multiple trims of the i7, from the eDrive50 and eDrive60 to the flagship M70.

The timing is far from coincidental. For years, the federal government offered a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying EV and plug-in hybrid purchases, though the rules were notoriously complex. Automakers lost eligibility after selling more than 200,000 qualifying units, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act added even more restrictions, tying eligibility to where a car was assembled, where its battery materials were sourced, and even placing caps on MSRP and buyer income. Those changes alone had already knocked some BMWs, like the German-built i4, off the list of eligible models. Then, in September 2025, the entire program was sunset altogether, leaving no new EVs or PHEVs eligible for the credit.

In that light, BMW’s new rebate isn’t just a discount—it’s a bridge. By offering the same $7,500 figure the federal government once provided, BMW is keeping its electric lineup competitive in a market where rivals are also scrambling to replace lost incentives with their own rebates and financing offers.

More Backing Behind EVs

It’s also a signal of where the company’s priorities lie. With the Neue Klasse EVs set to debut in 2026, BMW needs to maintain momentum and customer interest in its current generation of electric cars. Extending a lifeline to EV buyers helps soften the landing from the loss of federal support.

When you apply BMW’s new $7,500 rebate, the offerings are enticing. The i4 eDrive40, for instance, effectively drops to around $50,400 and the i5 eDrive40 to $67,100.",https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bmw-ix-charging-00.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:11.876434

Darling Ingredients Investment Narrative Recap

Shareholders in Darling Ingredients are typically focused on the company’s role as a key supplier to the renewable fuels and specialty ingredients markets, where policy change and demand trends are crucial drivers. The announced sale of US$125 million in production tax credits is a factor in Darling’s efforts to support near-term cash generation and debt reduction, but has minimal direct impact on the immediate regulatory risks and industry margin pressures that currently overshadow the biggest near-term catalysts.

Among the recent company updates, the agreement to sell production tax credits generated from the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture stands out, as it directly addresses Darling Ingredients’ high leverage. While proceeds from this deal could allow greater financial flexibility, near-term earnings and cash generation remain tied to broader regulatory developments and market pricing for renewable fuels.

However, with the volatility driven by regulatory and policy uncertainty around renewable fuel obligations, investors should be aware that…

Darling Ingredients' outlook anticipates $6.5 billion in revenue and $673.1 million in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes 4.3% annual revenue growth and a $567.7 million increase in earnings from the current $105.4 million level.

She put that on the table.” Hall was unconcerned about the possibility of a legal challenge to the tax increase.

In total, the state’s courts will see $383.6 million ($276 million General Fund), a 2.7% increase from this year.","The 2025-26 fiscal year budget was finally put to bed after midnight days after the official start of the fiscal year and months after a statutory deadline earlier this summer as legislative leaders worked mostly behind the scenes for much of the week.

Thursday’s session unfolded in the same way much of this week has, with lawmakers mostly waiting to take votes. At around 9:45 p.m. the House passed the general omnibus budget, HB 4706, but more action wasn’t taken until after 1 a.m.

Unfortunately, the invocation given in the Senate when the upper chamber gaveled back in after midnight on Friday – “Dear lord, please help us pass this budget; amen” – didn’t make a specific plea to a higher power for expediency. The Senate would eventually act on the budget bills a little after 1 a.m.

Although the Senate took action on HB 4706 and passed SB 166, the education omnibus budget, after 1 a.m., it didn’t take up the marijuana wholesale tax increase or the road funding bills until after 3 a.m.

When the amended road funding bills arrived in the House shortly after 4 a.m., carried by Senate Assistant Secretary Margaret O’Brian, the chamber erupted into applause. House members been waiting to take concurrence votes.

The snag which caught the Senate was approving budget implementation bills, particularly HB 4951, the 24% wholesale tax on marijuana. Around 2:30 a.m. House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, and Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, were both on the Senate floor whipping votes for the legislation. The Senate eventually passed the legislation as part of a long-term road funding plan (see separate story).

The House voted 101-8 on the general omnibus and 104-5 on the education budget. Both budgets cleared the Senate 31-5.

The bills are headed to the desk of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who remained mostly sequestered in her office between the House and Senate chambers throughout the night, periodically pulling groups of lawmakers in for meetings.

Whitmer thanked the legislative leaders and mentioned her signature campaign issue to “fix the damn roads,” is addressed through bills passed Thursday.

“I ran for office in large part because I wanted to fix the damn roads. Over the past seven years, we’ve made historic progress, fixing 24,500 lane miles and 1,900 bridges,” Whitmer said in a statement. “With this budget, we’re locking in a significant, bipartisan investment to fix state and local roads for decades to come, creating and protecting thousands of jobs in the process. I’m proud to deliver on my promise and look forward to driving on safer, smoother roads long after my time as governor.”

Farhat said that although the budget process was ugly, in the end, the Legislature got both the appropriations bills and their implementation bills across the finish line.

“What’s important is that we’re able to put aside partisan differences when we’re coming together in good faith,” he said. “There were many moments throughout this process it looked like … getting a budget that made sense for Michigan was out of reach, but I’m really proud that we were able to come together and get that done.”

Senate Democrats praised the spending proposals that moved through the Legislature Thursday. Details of both bills were revealed later Thursday before being unanimously adopted by conference committees.

“This budget shows that we can work together across party lines and deliver for the people of Michigan,” Sen. Sarah Anthony, D-Lansing, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. “This budget keeps people front and center by protecting health care access, investing in our schools, and making everyday life more affordable. It also proves that we can come together, even when it’s tough, to deliver a responsible, balanced plan that meets today’s needs and keeps our state moving forward.”

Hall said that much of the grind to get the budget across the finish line was due to negotiations over transparency on legislative earmarks.

“The reason the government shut down is because the Democrats didn’t want to do this,” he said. “We took it all the way up to the brink, and then they did it, and we’re going to make it a permanent law change.”

Passing transparency legislation will solve the problems the Legislature encountered in this year’s 10-month long budget process, Hall said.

“We’re going to disclose the pork spending,” he said. “Once…this stuff is disclosed earlier in the process, I think it’ll be a lot easier, because hopefully we won’t see as much opposition and obstruction to the transparency. That was the hardest part.”

Farhat, however, said the process was delayed because House Republicans didn’t introduce their budget proposal until the end of August.

“That is an issue when you’re trying to negotiate – not knowing the positions of the people on the other side of the table,” he said. “But when the moment it happened, we saw serious conversations ignited right away.”

Farhat said that the budget needed to be a less partisan process.

“We focus more on the issues that the working families and residents are asking us to focus on and less on political games,” he said. “I hope everyone has learned a couple very important lesson from this process and that we use those to prevent being where we are right now. Uncertainty isn’t good for Michigan.”

Hall said that the budget process showed that lawmakers should be having more conversations about what’s being spent rather than just what cuts to make.

“It’s just what are we cutting versus what was budgeted last year,” he said. “What I want to do next year is really dig into the actual spend numbers and make sure we’re cutting even deeper into those.”

The bill funding the state’s departments and agencies moved through the House easily around 9:45 p.m.

It includes $51.8 billion in gross funding for the state’s departments and agencies. Of that, $12.5 billion is General Fund.

It passed 101-8. Rep. Gregory Alexander, R; Carsonville; Rep. Timmy Beson, R-Bay City; Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers; Rep. Jim DeSana, R-Carleton; Rep. Phil Green, R-Watertown Township; Rep. Jaime Greene, R-Richmond; Rep. Brad Paquette, R-Niles; and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City voted against the omnibus.

About four hours later and after passing several budget implementation bills from the Senate, the House passed SB 166, the bill authorizing funding for Michigan’s K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education.

The bill passed 104-5. Carra, DeSana, Paquette, Wegela and Rep. Regina Weiss, D-Oak Park, voted no.

On the Senate side, Republicans Sen. Thomas Albert of Lowell, Sen. Joe Bellino of Monroe, Sen. Jonathan Lindsey of Coldwater, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township and Sen. Jim Runestad of White Lake voted no on both bills.

Hall said using School Aid Fund for community colleges and universities was important to sustaining higher education, though Democrats were uncomfortable with the shift.

“While we increase per pupil funding to a record high of $10,050, that number remains well below the national average of $17,700, and at the same time this budget shift hundreds of millions of dollars to higher ed dollars that could be allocated to do even more for our K-12 students,” Rep. Carol Glanville, D-Walker, said during a floor speech prior to the passage of SB 166.

The budget for universities relies on $850 million from the School Aid Fund, up from $461 million in the current year. Community colleges received $493 million from the School Aid Fund, which is in line with recent years.

Still, Glanville said the School Aid Fund budget provided funding for important priorities, such as universal school meals, the special education foundation allowance, increased funding for English language learners and transportation in rural districts.

“We’re giving our schools the flexibility they need at the local level to ensure that each individual child has the unique support they need to succeed,” she said. “We’ve landed on a student focused agreement that we can all be proud of.”

Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Saginaw Township touted the additional funding for school safety and mental health included in the School Aid Fund budget.

“These are real, tangible improvements for families,” he said during a floor speech.

Both chambers also passed several budget implementation bills during the marathon session.

Among them were HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183, which make changes to the state’s fuel tax and redirect the funding to roads. The House concurred with the amendments made by the Senate early Friday morning.

The House passed bills modifying state fees and disbursement of funds including SB 579, SB 577, SB 574, and SB 578.

SB 579, the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, passed the House 104-5. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, and Paquette voted no.

SB 577, water fees, passed 103-6. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, Rep. Peter Herzberg, D-Westland, and Paquette voted no.

SB 574, tobacco settlement revenue, and SB 578, the Moveable Bridge Fund, passed 104-5. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene and Paquette voted no.

The House also passed SB 273, which would amend yearly fees pesticide distributors and fertilizer manufacturers and distributors pay the state. It passed 107-2, Carra and DeSana voted no.

Finally, the House passed SB 565, which amends the Michigan Trust Fund Act to lapse money in the Local Government Reimbursement Fund at the end of the fiscal year back into the General Fund. It passed 102-7. Alexander, Carra, DeSana, Greene, Herzberg, and Rep. Veronica Paiz, D-Harper Woods; and Paquette voted no.

Lawmakers completed work early Friday morning on passing a slate of budget implementation bills that will set up a long-term state road funding plan, including the enactment of a controversial wholesale tax on cannabis products.

Senators voted 19-17 to pass HB 4951 which will enact a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis. The vote came after leadership spent much of Thursday and overnight into Friday morning working to round up the votes needed to get the key component of the road funding plan across the finish line.

The marijuana proposal drew sharp backlash from those in the cannabis industry, who showed up to the Capitol by the hundreds this week demanding lawmakers oppose the tax over concerns that it could upend the industry in Michigan and result in job losses.

Members also voted 22-14 for HB 49161, which will enable the state to “decouple” state and federal business taxes as well as HB 4968, which is an attempt to preserve some form of insurance provider tax.

Work on the road funding plan was completed with the passage of substitute versions of HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183, which will implement a fuel tax swap.

Substitutes were adopted for HB 4180, HB 4181, HB 4182, and HB 4183 prior to final passage changing the start date for the gas tax swap to Jan. 1, 2026.

Exemptions for aviation fuel are removed under HB 4180 and HB 4182. Language providing a backfill for revenue lost to the School Aid Fund is included in HB 4180. All four bills were also tie-barred to SB 578, which deals with the Movable Bridge Fund.

The Senate voted 30-6 on HB 4180, 31-5 on HB 4181, and HB 4182, and 24-12 on HB 4183. The House later concurred in the Senate substitutes on all four bills, voting 102-7, 102-7, 101-8, and 98-11, respectively.

Three Republicans sided with the Democrats to pass HB 4961 and HB 4968: Sen. Mark Huizenga of Walker, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan, and Sen. Michael Webber of Rochester Hills.

It was a bipartisan vote in support of HB 4951, with 15 Democrats being joined by four Republicans.

Democrats voting for HB 4951 were Sen. Sarah Anthony of Lansing; Sen. Rosemary Bayer of West Bloomfield; Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks of Grand Rapids; Sen. Darrin Camilleri of Trenton; Sen. Mary Cavangh of Redford Township; Sen. Stephanie Chang of Detroit; Sen. John Cherry of Flint; Sen. Erika Geiss of Taylor; Sen. Veronica Klinefelt of Eastpointe; Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo; Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak; Sen. Jeremy Moss of Bloomfield Township; Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia; Sen. Sam Singh of East Lansing and Sen. Paul Wojno of Warren.

Republicans supporting the bill were Sen. Kevin Daley of Lum, Sen. Dan Lauwers of Brockway, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan and Sen. Roger Victory of Georgetown Township.

With this budget, Michigan will finally have a long-term road funding plan, House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, said.

“Republicans have been trying to do this sales tax swap since Jase Bolger, and we’re finally getting it done,” he said. “To dedicate all of the money collected at the pump to the roads, that’s a big deal. People understand that … that’s an important tax policy change.”

The 24% wholesale tax on marijuana was essential to the deal struck between the House, Senate, and the governor’s office for a budget deal and road funding, Hall said, and any of the heartburn the Senate had about voting for the increase was their own fault.

“Brinks provided options that she could do,” Hall said. “Democrats should have passed a roads plan, that would have made this a lot easier. By not doing that, they empowered Winnie Brinks to decide behind closed doors which revenue they could back. She put that on the table.”

Hall was unconcerned about the possibility of a legal challenge to the tax increase.

Cannabis was legalized in Michigan by a ballot proposal, and under Michigan law, a three-fourths majority is needed to amend an initiated act passed by voters. HB 4951, the bill implementing the tax and creating the Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act, fell short of that margin by five votes.

“When Brinks and the governor put this on the table, they did a legal review, and they came to the conclusion that you could do it this way,” he said.

In addition to road funding, House Democrats also touted record funding for transit.

“We’ve heard that for a long time now, that we need to fix the damn roads, and we did a great job of our state lines and our trunk lines, but we’re finally going to see money going straight to our neighborhood roads,” Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, said.

Rep. Jason Morgan, D-Ann Arbor, said the funding included for transit in the budget was a major win for Democrats.

The Transportation Funding Package agreed to for the final budget provides money for state trunkline roads and bridges, makes changes to the distribution formula in Act 51 for cities, villages and counties, provides money for rail grade separation, and local bus operations.

“This is going to be the largest investment in public transit, probably in my lifetime,” Morgan said. “This budget will include about $160 million a year for public transportation throughout our state … this is going to be transformational for Michigan.”

The debate over HB 4951 was more divisive.

Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, called the cannabis tax a terrible idea that will drive people to the black market and derail the marijuana industry in Michigan.

“This Legislature is trying to do an end-run around the will of the people and massively increase the tax on cannabis,” Irwin said. “This is going to drive Michigan customers out of the legal market. This is telling customers from other states ‘stop bringing your money to Michigan.’”

He said voters wanted the revenue from marijuana taxes to go not just to roads but to schools and local communities, adding the bill cuts out schools and communities.

McBroom spoke in support of the bill, saying he has seen communities in his district that have been swamped with marijuana businesses and a rise in crime.

“Where are the benefits?” McBroom said. “We have an industry that is out of control. It’s too large and it’s failing to deliver to the promises they gave to us when they said they come to our state.”

McBroom said he believed the tax may “do some right-sizing” of the marijuana industry.

Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, was also opposed to the proposal. He pointed to the effect it could have on small businesses and workers in the industry.

“I can understand the arguments about the practicality of the state believes that it needs more money, so we’ve got to tax something, and this seems like an easy target,” Lindsey said, adding he was disappointed in hearing comments this week from people wanting to hurt the industry.

Lindsey said he believed the bill would not accomplish its purpose to raise significant revenue for road funding.

Irwin was also opposed to the fuel tax swap package, saying it is not revenue neutral for those who drive electric vehicles and hybrids, spiking fees for both.

The bills would increase the fee for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to increase from $30 to $80, and for electric vehicles from $60 to $160.

“There is a huge problem in this package of legislation for K-12 schools and for our local governments,” Irwin added.

Irwin said local governments have raised concerns about the possibility of losing constitutional revenue sharing and not receiving the full funding that is lost from the Legislature.

Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township, said for years roughly $1 billion in revenue generated at the pump has gone to uses other than roads and that needs to end.

“It’s about time we take that promise to make sure every dime that hard-working taxpayers pay at the pump actually goes to fix our roads,” Nesbitt said.

Lawmakers unveiled the 2025-26 fiscal year budget and passed the proposal that balanced the House Republican priority that it include spending cuts and still provide key initiatives to keep the Democratic majority on board.

SB 166 and HB 4706 cleared both chambers on Thursday in votes that went into Friday morning after a protracted budget process that required a continuation spending bill to keep state government operating.

Boilerplate across the budget requires agencies to prioritize in-person work, but the Republican effort to prohibit diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives did not make the final version.

In total, the budget is about $75.9 billion with an additional $5 billion being held in contingency funds so not counted in the total. The General Fund is about $14 billion.

The education budget includes $24.12 billion ($1.56 billion General Fund) for K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education.

“House Democrats have been clear from the beginning that our priorities in this budget were collective wins that would benefit all Michiganders, from students to patients to working families, and everyone in between,” House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri, D-Canton, said in a statement. “We delivered on those priorities tonight, and we’re going to keep delivering the wins that the people of this state need to thrive.”

The K-12 portion is $21.29 billion ($73.15 million General Fund), a 2.5% increase from the current year (7.2% General Fund). Per pupil funding will rise by 4.6% to $10.61 billion, or $10,050 per pupil.

Overall, the K-12 budget maintains the traditional structure outside of the per pupil grant with several categorical programs supplementing those funds for specific purposes. House Republicans had proposed rolling most of the funds together and boosting the per pupil grant much higher, though school districts opposed that concept.

“I’m proud that Senate Democrats held the line and worked across the aisle to successfully deliver another historic education budget that puts the real needs of students front and center,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said in a statement. “By securing the highest ever per-pupil funding, continuing the widely successful universal school meals program, and boosting literacy programs and at-risk funding, this bipartisan budget illustrates our unwavering commitment to Michigan students, educators, and schools.”

There are 25% increases for at-risk students and English language learners. There are 4.6% funding increases for intermediate school districts, career, and technical education and isolated districts.

Michigan Virtual University also gets a $1.8 million bump to $9.8 million.

The bill also includes a $100 million reduction in reimbursement to school districts for the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System.

Education groups, however, noted the budget passed after the start of their fiscal years on July 1.

“No lawmaker should be celebrating or expecting gratitude for a budget passed more than three months beyond their legal obligation to get it done and with zero transparency to allow it to be reviewed until shortly before it was passed,” K-12 Alliance of Michigan Executive Director Robert McCann said in a statement.

For community colleges, there’s an overall 6.8% increase. The budget contains a 3% increase – labeled one-time only – for college operations using the performance funding formula. The overall operational increase is 2.1%. That translates to increases ranging from 1.5% to 3.2% among the 28 colleges. The rest of the increase comes from MPSERS related costs.

Total community college funding would be $493 million, all from the School Aid Fund. That is in line with recent history of School Aid paying for some or all of the community colleges budget.

Higher education will see a 0.5% increase, with a gross total of $2.34 billion ($1.48 billion General Fund). All of the state’s public universities will see increases to their state operational funding, but Michigan State University and the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor flagship will see comparatively smaller increases of 2.1% each than their peers around the state.

The higher education budget relies on $850 million from the School Aid Fund, up from $461 million in the current year.

The large increases to some universities and large cuts to Michigan State University and the University of Michigan’s main campus in Ann Arbor that passed the House were scrapped.

A road funding proposal that included a marijuana tax increase and the removal of sales tax on fuel purchases was the key component to a nearly 16% increase in funding for the Department of Transportation.

Total fiscal year 2025-26 funding for MDOT will be $7.89 billion, an increase of 15.8% over the last fiscal year. Under the road funding package of $1.14 billion, counties will be allocated $456.7 million, cities and villages will see $246.1 million, and the remaining $179.7 million will be placed in the State Trunkline Fund.

Revenue sharing saw a $70 million pot for public safety for cities, villages, townships, and counties. Traditional revenue sharing was reduced or remained flat.

Constitutional revenue sharing under the new budget is set at $1.01 billion, a reduction of $63.6 million from the previous fiscal year.

Revenue sharing to cities, villages and townships would remain at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ($333.5 million), as would revenue sharing to counties ($291.1 million).

The conference also included $50 million in public safety revenue sharing grants and an additional $20 million in one-time grants for public safety.

House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, touted the cuts made the cuts made to the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, specifically around the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Strategic Outreach Attraction and Reserve Fund.

“We eliminated a lot of waste, fraud and abuse in the budget,” he said. “No new money for SOAR. … The wasteful grant programs, you saw cuts to the MEDC, and then what was important is we capped a lot of these one-time spends.”

LEO indeed faced some steep cuts, with a $690 million cut from the previous year. The budget topline stands at just over $1.7 billion for the coming fiscal year compared to last year’s $2.4 billion.

The incentives for business investment in the state received major cuts in the Business Attraction and Community Revitalization line item, with the conference calling for a $40.7 million reduction, removing all general fund funding, leaving the 21st Century Jobs Trust Fund with $59.3 million.

The Revitalization and Placemaking Program, which provided access for gap financing for infrastructure development and real estate rehabilitation, was removed in the sunset of the program’s funding source under a $50 million earmark from Corporate Income Tax revenue authorized first in 2022.

The Going Pro fund, used for employers to assist in training in the trades, also cut around $22.9 million of general fund dollars and shifted the remaining $22.3 million from ongoing to one-time. The House had originally called for removing all funds.

The budget also cut 53 of the 60 one-time programs from last year’s fiscal year, resulting in $633 million.

Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, said the Legislature should pivot its focus to economic development issues once the budget is wrapped up.

“I think that’s a very serious issue that we’ll look at later,” Farhat said.

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s budget shrinks by 6.9% to a total of $967.7 million ($170 million General Fund).

Major increases made were a $13.4 million one-time appropriation for lead service line removal and replacement and $34 million in one-time funding for grants and loans to support local government water infrastructure projects.

The conference also agreed to include a boilerplate item requiring EGLE to report the number of permit application appeals filed each fiscal year, as well as the number of applications approved within 30, 60, and 90 days, 6 months, and one year after an application is determined administratively complete.

The Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources will see a 7% decrease, with a total of $145.8 million gross ($77.5 million General Fund) to be spent. Significant decreases contributing to that 7% include an $800,000 decrease to emergency management baseline funding with no change in FTEs and a $500,000 reduction to ongoing funding for emerging contaminates in food and agriculture, a smaller reduction than the $1.6 million initially proposed by House Republicans.

The Department of Education will see a slight cut with $164.7 million ($62.5 million General Fund), a $228,400 cut from current year ($1.4 million General Fund).

Among the changes in the conference report, the bill would eliminate the $100,000 for the state poet laureate.

The Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential will see a 2.8% increase. The $662.2 million ($201.6 million General Fund) is $18.2 million higher than last year ($65.1 million General Fund). Much of the increase is due to Child Development and Care caseload costs.

The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs also would see an increase with $290.2 million ($128.2 million General Fund), which is $14.3 million higher than last year ($10.5 million General Fund).

Key in the Military budget is the $26 million for infrastructure upgrades at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base.

The Department of Insurance and Financial Services will see $79.4 million, a $785,000 increase. The department receives no General Fund dollars.

The final budget does provide funding toward the statewide management system being developed by the state’s judiciary. In total, the state’s courts will see $383.6 million ($276 million General Fund), a 2.7% increase from this year.

The statewide management system will see $1.8 million ongoing and $2 million one-time with no additional full-time equivalent positions.

The Department of Attorney General is taking a 2.6% cut overall, losing around $3 million. The overall budget stands at over $126 million. The House’s proposal sported a 30% deduction. There is a significant swapping out of General Fund money in exchange for restricted funds.

The Department of Civil Rights is looking at a $28 million budget with a $723,800 deduction from last year. One major cut was $1.5 million in general funds for museum support across the state, but the department did see an increase in information technology demands with an increase in $767,800.

The Executive Office received an increase of $272,100 with a $9.6 million budget. The increase was in economic adjustments for negotiated salary and wage increases for employees.

The Legislature also saw an increase of $172,500 with an overall budget of $200.8 million. The jump came from legislature operations.

The Legislative Auditor General received an overall budget of $31.7 million with an increase of $468,600 in general operations money.

The Department of Corrections budget totals $2.16 billion ($2.12 billion General Fund). That represents a 0.8% increase from last year’s budget.

Michigan’s congressional Democrats said during a press call Wednesday that the ongoing federal government shutdown could end if health care costs are addressed.

This is the 15th federal government shutdown since 1981, but the federal government has not faced a shutdown in the past seven years.

After not being able to vote on a budget deal Tuesday night, the U.S. Senate Democrats also blocked a Republican proposal to keep the government at existing funding levels through late November. The bill did not hit the 60-vote threshold with only 55 affirmative votes.

In a press call with the delegation on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, said this is a “Republican shutdown,” and the holdouts are about making things affordable for their constituents, focusing on the health care.

The White House released a statement Wednesday calling it a “Democrat Shutdown,” calling the hold out from Democrats “unserious” and “shameful political gamesmanship.”

One of the major hold outs is for the health care tax credit that expires at the end of December, which could substantially increase health care costs, according to Dingell.

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, said that until there is some relief on premiums doubling and rising costs in general, she is “a solid no vote.”

McDonald Rivet said that she hears Republicans saying they want to restore the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act tax credits and want to put it on the floor.

“If they actually believe that, if they actually want that, put it on the floor and we open the government tomorrow,” she said.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, said the delegation always feels like they’re in the “emergency department,” having to triage when federal funding is threatened.

“We all know right now there is a health care crisis, and I think people don’t realize that we have to move with the urgency,” Tlaib said. “We don’t have time when folks try to push that deadline. But we know for weeks Trump has refused to negotiate on the issues around health care.”

Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, said one couple in her district making $82,000 a year would face a 200% increase in premium costs from $700 to $1,700, which she said is “untenable” with housing and food costs. But she said, with the federal budget bill, there can be $700 per day tax handouts to the top 1%.

Some of the criticism from Republicans on the health care negotiations is that Democrats want to give health care through Medicaid to those living in the country illegally. Dingell said this is strictly a diversion from real budget talks and Tlaib said they been unable to share evidence to support their claims.

When it comes to weighing the implications of the shutdown versus the decision to not vote on the budget, Dingell said they are talking to the government workers affected by this, and while it was not a decision they took lightly, the delegation goes home every weekend and hears issues of affordability and health care, needing ultimately to protect that over delaying a shutdown.

Looking at the budget crises across D.C. and their home state, Dingell said one of the overlaps between the budgets is looking to support WIC and other food programs that may not have large allocations in the state budget, wanting to find federal funding for the increased demand on programs that are seeing fewer resources.

Dingell said 42% of the state budget is made up of federal dollars, and they have close working relationships with the state legislators in their district, knowing that the cuts are all connected, federal decisions impacting what will be in the state budget, creating more uncertainty.

Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, directed the House’s chief administrative officer ahead of the shutdown that the House of Representatives withhold his pay if there was a lapse in appropriations.

“Members of Congress shouldn’t get paid while our federal employees and troops on the front lines go without,” Barrett said in a statement. “If Democrats shut down the government tonight, I’ll be withholding my pay until we get it back open for the American people. I voted with conviction to keep the government open. It’s time for Senate Democrats to put people before politics and do the same.”

The Michigan Strategic Fund Board approved projects Tuesday to bring an international automotive company’s regional headquarters to Wixom, provide millions for upgrades in water infrastructure and build housing development in Bay City.

Astemo Americas, Inc., a supplier of automotive systems, received a $2 million grant to bring a capital investment of $95 million to Wixom, combining their U.S. headquarters in Kentucky and technical center in Farmington Hills.

The company employs 320 employees in Michigan now, and this project would create 200 new jobs with more than 150 engineering and research and development positions, according to John Nunneley, senior vice president, design engineering and program management and general manager at Hitachi Astemo Americas.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer visited Astemo on her trip to Japan this past month. The project was announced by the company on Sept. 3 before approval.

Michelle Grinnell, chief communications and attraction officer for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, told reporters before the meeting that while it is not their “typical timeline” for projects, there is some flexibility when the governor has investment missions before the board has finalized the project.

“There are just these unique moments occasionally that come up where we want to take advantage of having Michigan leadership and company leadership in a room together in market to be able to talk about why we are working together and why these investments are coming to Michigan,” Grinnell said.

A deal with JR Automation, an automated manufacturing company, was also announced earlier this month with Hitachi before board approval at the Tuesday meeting. JR Automation will receive a $1.6 million grant for consolidation of West Michigan operations in Zeeland, which will lead to a $72.8 million investment with 150 new jobs.

The company had been considering consolidation in South Carolina instead but decided to land in Michigan due to its existing workforce and the incentive assistance, according to the project brief.

The company also received a local property tax abatement of around $9.5 million and a State Education Tax Abatement around $2.3 million.

“This project will unify three of the company’s existing facilities in Western Michigan into a single global headquarters facility in Zeeland with space for headquarters functions, manufacturing and enough room to grow and even double its footprint in the future, if needed,” Amanda Eisbrenner, business development advisor at the MEDC, said. “Moreover, the company views the project as a talent attraction and customer acquisition tool, as it plans to develop a world-class facility with a showroom for robots, AI, cobot demos and more.”

American Rheinmetall, a defense manufacturer with headquarters in Sterling Heights, was approved for a $7.52 million grant as well as an expansion with a relocation to Auburn Hills, consolidating other metro Detroit facilities as it upscales its engineering capability to sign more U.S. Department of Defense contracts.

This would also create 450 new jobs across four facilities including Lapeer, Lansing, and Plymouth with $31.75 million in capital investment. The positions would pay on average $25 to $56 an hour.

The company received a grant before for expanding its Sterling Heights facility in 2022 but changed course in its consolidation effort. The MEDC disbursed some $980,000 of the $1.5 million grant and are in good standing as of July 2025.

“This project helps position us as really, a true national leader in the defense sector and continues to help us diversify into new forms of advanced mobility, R&D, and engineering, which is what our greatest capability is here across the Detroit region,” Justin Robinson, senior vice president of business development at the Detroit Regional Partnership said. “Additionally, these high-paying jobs help us continue to retain that skilled workforce that’s here, right? Our core industry of automotive is going through transition. These defense sector jobs present very similar opportunities based on their skills to retain and attract those folks that are being laid off.”

Outside of the business, the board also approved nearly $22 million water infrastructure grant funding for 12 communities including Albion, Allegan, Benton Township, Big Rapids, Evart, Grayling, Hartford, Houghton, Ironwood, Olivet, village of Baraga, and the village of Hillman.

The funding can go toward projects such as sanitary and storm sewer lines, water lines, wastewater treatment plants, and related activities around treatment plants. Bay City will also see a new housing development with an economic assistance loan for Riverview Apartments on the north end of downtown. The building will include 90 housing units and two commercial storefronts.

Shellene Thurston, economic development marketing manager for Bay City, said these apartments will be transformative.

“Not only does this revitalize our downtown by creating walkable community, but also supports this attainable workforce housing, all of which are included in our local master plan, which has just been recently updated to include a significant emphasis on housing,” Thurston said. “This activates a key site in a gateway to the northern section of our downtown and turns contaminated property into a productive community asset.”

NextEra Energy Capital Holdings Inc. received a bond in an amount not exceeding $175 million for funding a renewable natural gas facility in New Boston to convert landfill gas into clean natural gas. Jay Frazier, senior attorney at NextEra Energy, said the company is established and is expected to make its returns.

Construction on the facility is set to begin in June 2026 and begin commercial operation in June 2027. Internally, the MEDC requested an extension of the memorandum of understanding for seeking reimbursement for administrative expenses. This year, the MEDC just requested the specification of responsibilities in administering the 21st Century Jobs Trust Fund initiative and other programs.

Usually, the MEDC requests allocation of funds for this, but did not this year because of budget uncertainty. Matthew Casby, chief board relations officer and MSF fund manager, said once there is a budget, the MEDC will request allocation.

Other approvals included an extension for the deadline for funds to Side Door Michigan, a venture capital investment fund, which has been approved twice in the past, and a state tax capture for Bay Valley Resort.

Whitmer championed the investments and housing development.

“Michigan’s economy is open for business and on the move,” Whitmer said in a statement. “We’re revitalizing our communities, investing in our workforce, and building affordable housing. I’ll continue going everywhere and competing with anyone to tell Michigan’s story and show more individuals, families, and businesses how they can ‘make it’ in Michigan. Let’s keep growing our economy, unleashing our innovators, and making our state the best place to live, work and play.”

MEDC Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer Jr. said in a statement that the MSF was committed to “executing the state’s ‘Make it in Michigan’ economic development strategy.”

“We continue to be grateful to have the legislatively appropriated funds to provide solutions for Michigan’s most-pressing barriers to growth and prosperity so that our 10 million+ friends, families, and future neighbors will have more reasons to realize their employment, entrepreneurial and housing dreams here in Michigan,” Messer said.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MI-capitol-flag.png,N,,2025-10-03 16:02:24.303352

According to the DOE, a review determined the projects did not “adequately advance the nation’s energy needs” or were not economically viable. We don’t know what is being cut yet, but the Natural Resources Defense Council anticipates losing some battery plants, hydrogen projects, carbon-capture endeavors, and perhaps most importantly, upgrades to the electric grid.

People living in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, assuredly already coping with rising electricity bills, will now be further harmed at the hand of a President who is out of touch with the modern energy paradigm and the place of renewables within it. The numbers don’t lie – despite all the roadblocks put up by the administration, solar and wind make up 90% of all new electricity capacity so far in 2025.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, moonlighting as the Grim Reaper in a bizarre AI-produced video pushed by Trump himself—a twisted homage to Blue Öyster Cult, seemingly celebrating the clawing back of federal funds—made no attempt to explain how the DOE came up with the list of targeted states.

ArcLight Announces $1B CPP Investment in AlphaGen

On Thursday, infrastructure investor ArcLight announced that Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) has entered into a definitive agreement to invest $1 billion for a strategic minority position in AlphaGen. AlphaGen boasts one of the largest independent power portfolios in the U.S., with more than 11 gigawatts (GW) of critical power assets located in strategic markets.

ArcLight and the AlphaGen portfolio are well-positioned to help deploy critical infrastructure that can provide capacity, reliability, and “time to power” this need in fast-growing markets like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other parts of the PJM Interconnection market. The investment is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

“As demand for electricity accelerates, these assets will play a vital role in balancing renewable growth with the need for reliable supply,” assessed Bill Rogers, Head of Sustainable Energies, CPP Investments. “Partnering with ArcLight, a highly experienced investor in power markets, positions us well to support AlphaGen’s strong operational performance to deliver sustainable, long-term value for the CPP Fund.”

Ampacity opens Distribution Center in Iowa to Support Power InFrastructure Projects

End-to-end structural and electrical solutions company Ampacity has announced that its new 300,000-square-foot distribution facility in Des Moines, Iowa, is fully operational. The warehouse is tailored to support construction firms, developers, and utilities building solar, wind, battery storage, and data center infrastructure projects across the United States.

It will serve as an operational hub, handling stocking, fulfillment, logistics, kitting, prefabrication, and material storage functions that keep large, complex projects running smoothly.

“It’s only been two years since we opened our Kentucky warehouse, and that facility is now running at full capacity. The industry is asking for more from us, and this new distribution center is a key part of our response,” explained Eben Russell, founder and President of Ampacity.

In addition to expanded handling and distribution capacity for Ampacity’s longstanding single-axis solar tracker business line, the Des Moines site houses the company’s largest-ever investments in handling and processing machinery for electrical goods. The warehouse features a three-to-one wire spooling line that simplifies cable installation by combining multiple reels into a single run. The team at the facility also performs custom cutting of medium-voltage cables and assembles modular kits that are pre-configured for specific phases of construction, helping reduce manual labor, limit installation errors, and enable customers to keep their projects moving with greater consistency and efficiency.

“We’ve gotten this facility off the ground fast. In this market, time is of the essence, and we’re already stocked with the wire and cable, termination kits, sectionalizing cabinets, and single-axis tracker material that our customers need to keep moving,” said Jeremy Haugen, Ampacity’s director of operations in Des Moines. “At this point, our focus is on scaling up the prefabrication and kitting work that we perform in the warehouse. Ampacity has a tradition of trusting people with years of experience in the field to create better ways of delivering goods. We’re bringing that spirit to Des Moines.”

CPS ENERGY Starts Operations on 2-hour Duration BESS

CPS Energy, the nation’s largest municipally owned electric and natural gas utility, has started operations at Padua 1, a 50-megawatt (MW), 2-hour duration battery energy storage system (BESS) in Bexar County, Texas.

Padua 1, owned and operated by Eolian, was part of an RFP seeking 50 MW of battery storage that the utility launched in 2020. CPS Energy entered into a storage capacity agreement for Padua 1 with Eolian in 2023. This project advances the utility’s Vision 2027 strategy, which emphasizes delivering reliable, resilient, and cleaner energy solutions to meet the needs of San Antonio’s growing population.

Padua 1 connects directly to the CPS Energy grid and is designed to charge during periods of excess electricity supply to provide capacity that would be readily available to deploy during the hours of highest system cost and needs. This added flexibility to both absorb and discharge electricity within seconds helps strengthen grid reliability, improves system operations during peak usage, and supports the integration of cleaner energy resources, especially during extreme weather and high energy demand days.

“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy D. Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. “It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead. Battery storage strengthens our ability to continue to serve our customers reliably now and in the future.”

Once completed in early 2026, the Padua Grid battery energy storage complex, which will total 400 MW and nearly 2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) when completed in early 2026, will be the largest battery energy storage deployment in Texas when completed.

“Padua Grid was sited years ago at a critical substation adjacent to the JK Spruce and retiring Braunig power plants and was specifically designed to reduce overloads on key transmission lines serving San Antonio,” recalled Aaron Zubaty, CEO of Eolian. “Battery energy storage projects of this scale enable the efficient utilization of existing transmission resources and are the lowest-cost and fastest solution to meeting the nation’s strategic need to grow electricity production by allowing baseload power plants to operate better.”

The completion of Padua 1 follows CPS Energy’s 2024 announcement of agreements for an additional 350 MW of battery energy storage capacity, which includes Padua 2, a 150 MW 4-hour system, and Ferdinand, a 200 MW 4-hour system; both projects were also developed by Eolian. Padua 2, also located in Bexar County, is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.

EDF and EPE Cut the Ribbon on Solar+Storage Project

Elsewhere in the southwest, EDF Power Solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) recently announced the start of operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The 150 MWdc solar photovoltaic project, combined with a 75 MWac/4-hour BESS, will supply electricity to EPE under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro Solar+Storage project enables EPE to manage evening energy ramps, mitigate curtailment, and stabilize its grid. The project created approximately 200 jobs during its peak construction phase, with 100 positions filled by New Mexico residents. Over Milagro’s operating lifespan, it is expected to generate around $18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County.

“For New Mexico, this project is especially meaningful,” said United States Senator Ben Ray Luján. “Our state is blessed with abundant sunshine, making solar energy a natural fit for our economy and environment. By pairing solar generation with advanced storage, you’re helping southern New Mexico communities gain more reliable access to power, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and supporting our state’s climate goals.”

“Launching our first solar and storage project in New Mexico is an exciting milestone, and we look forward to supporting EPE as this project delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions,” added Kate O’Hair, Senior Vice President of US Development for EDF Power Solutions.

“The start of commercial operations at the Milagro Solar+Storage project marks a significant step for our region,” shared Dave Hawkins, Vice President of System Planning and Operations Support for El Paso Electric. “It reflects our shared commitment to a cleaner, more resilient energy future – strengthening grid reliability and ensuring dependable service for our customers, even as energy demands evolve. We extend our sincere thanks to EDF Power Solutions for their leadership and partnership in bringing this transformative project to life.”

Lightshift Energy Microgrid Keeping Massachusetts Schools Powered During Outages

Virginia-based utility-scale battery energy storage provider Lightshift Energy, alongside the Wakefield Municipal Gas and Light Department (WMGLD) and the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC), recently celebrated the commercial operation of a 5 MW BESS that will power two Wakefield high schools and operate as a resilient, grid-connected microgrid.

Developed as part of WMGLD’s Energy Park Project, the battery system is designed primarily to reduce peak demand on the grid, which is expected to save local customers $20 million over the project’s lifetime. It will also provide backup power to Wakefield Memorial High School and Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocational High School during outages.

The battery displaces the need for diesel backup generators and uses peak shaving revenue to support full electrification of both buildings, enabling clean and reliable heating and cooling year-round.

“Energy storage was our first choice when identifying a more cost-effective and renewable solution to power the schools, compared to diesel backup generators that would have cost $1.2 million per generator,” said Peter Dion, WMGLD’s General Manager. “We are incredibly grateful to have the entire town’s support to deploy the Lightshift battery that will provide cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable electricity to our schools.”

This is the third project in a broader Lightshift-MMWEC partnership to bring energy storage systems to many of the joint action agency’s member utilities. The MMWEC program is estimated to provide more than $200 million in energy savings for residents across Massachusetts. MMWEC is the Commonwealth’s designated joint action agency for municipal utilities in Massachusetts.

“This project is such a great example of the many ways energy storage strengthens the communities we partner with. We are bringing clean backup power to schools and supporting their electrification while also providing WMGLD customers with major, risk-free savings,” said Rory Jones, co-founder and Managing Partner of Lightshift Energy.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT-Template-28.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:24.460707

That's why we're breaking down what a government shutdown means, how it could affect our families, why this matters in our fight to protect our environment, and what we can do now.
The Trump Shutdown is going to impact all of us.
From day one, Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the very protections for our air, water, and our public lands.
They are responsible for the harms this shutdown will cause our communities.","At midnight on Wednesday, October 1, Congress failed to reach a spending deal resulting in our federal government shutting down.

This shutdown is confusing and stressful to many of us. We rely on the federal government and the services it provides for our families, communities, businesses. That's why we're breaking down what a government shutdown means, how it could affect our families, why this matters in our fight to protect our environment, and what we can do now.

🤔 Why is this happening?

Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. Their gross mismanagement has led us here, with all of us suffering the consequences. Since day one, Trump has unraveled protections for clean air and safe drinking water, cut funding for clean energy initiatives that lower utility rates and costs for families, and fired or forced out hundreds of thousands of federal workers and civil servants.

In short, he has handed the keys to our government over to corrupt politicians, fossil fuel companies, and corporate polluters who paid to get him elected. Sadly, this shutdown is just the next illogical step in Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to dismantle our federal government.

Our democracy is very much at risk.

🤷🏽‍♀️ What does this mean for me?

The Trump Shutdown is going to impact all of us. Government workers deemed ""essential"" will be forced to work unpaid while others will get sent home. This will cause:

Social Security and other health and safety programs like nutritional assistance for families could see delays.

Air travel may become even more chaotic, dysfunctional, and potentially dangerous.

The FDA will likely reduce food inspections, while the EPA will suspend enforcement at hazardous waste sites, drinking water and chemical facilities that are breaking clean air and water laws.

Thousands of disaster relief workers, like those at FEMA, will face significant challenges due to funding shortages and delays in aid; many are expected to be furloughed.

🚨 What is at stake?

Because of Trump and Republicans, Americans are already paying through the roof for everyday necessities. Utility bills alone have gone up 10 percent in a matter of months. This shutdown will send prices for electricity, groceries, health care and more even higher.

National parks and other public lands are being forced to remain open, but with skeleton staffing, which will seriously harm these lands, wildlife, and nearby communities. What's more, federal disaster relief and aid programs, which are critical to protect and assist our communities even during ""normal"" circumstances, will be stretched by Trump's government shutdown, affecting long-term rebuilding efforts and leaving communities vulnerable if a major emergency occurs.

From day one, Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the very protections for our air, water, and our public lands. He’s gutted federal agencies, like the Department of the Interior, with layoffs and hiring freezes, leaving rangers and staff stretched thin.

Now, Trump and Republicans in Congress are holding our government hostage because they want to raise energy and healthcare costs to benefit their billionaire friends.

✋ How does it end?

Every day, Sierra Club works to protect people and the planet. To do that, we need a functioning democracy. Each Trump attack—from firing agency staff, to threatening local governments, to shutting down our government—pushes us further into an authoritarian future that I'm sure none of us want.

Right now, Democrats are working to protect our healthcare and lower costs, while Republicans are choosing to shut down the government. Trump and Congressional Republicans control every branch of the federal government. They are responsible for the harms this shutdown will cause our communities.

Trump and Republicans need to come to the table and negotiate with Democrats for a deal that doesn't escalate our healthcare emergency and other crises.

We all want this shutdown to be over as soon as possible, and we can't back down and trade our health, democracy, and future for their authoritarian demands.

🫵 What can we do?

Right now, the most important thing is to make sure the people in our communities understand what is at stake and who is to blame for this shutdown.

Trump is actively using illegal actions to punish his enemies, curtail freedom of speech and the media, and consolidate power. The overreach of the administration and ignoring the rule of law places all Americans at risk and makes it more difficult to fight for our environment and future.

(WEHT) – U.S. Senator Todd Young joined colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In the letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members wrote.

According to Sen. Young, in June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks. He says this is the import RIN reduction.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA’s policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

In addition to Senator Young, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin signed the letter. Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives, including Representatives Erin Houchin and Mark Messmer, also signed the letter. Other Tri-State representatives who signed it include Rep. James Comer and Rep. Mike Bost.

The news came from UAW Local 14 President Tony Totty, who confirmed that the decision was made last week and said no jobs will be affected.

“General Motors previously revised production plans at Toledo Propulsion to support additional capacity of ICE propulsion units in alignment with current market demand and manufacturing flexibility,” GM told WTOL in a statement.

The original plan was for Toledo Propulsion Systems, previously called Toledo Transmission, to be retooled to produce electric drive units for EVs. Back in 2022, GM announced a $760 million investment in the Toledo facility for this purpose, which would’ve made it the first GM U.S. powertrain facility retooled specifically for EV components. However, despite the hefty investment, no EV drive units have been produced for retail vehicles at the site.

The “previously revised production plans” the GM spokesperson mentioned refer to the automaker’s decision earlier this year to increase transmission production at the Toledo plant. The Toledo facility plays a critical role in supporting GM’s light-duty truck production, including vehicles assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana. With tariffs motivating General Motors to build more trucks in the U.S., those trucks need domestically built transmissions, and Toledo is building them.

The Toledo Propulsion Systems facility will also likely be a source of powertrain components for the Lake Orion assembly plant, which will soon be retooled to produce full-size trucks and SUVs. Lake Orion is another example of GM reversing course on its original EV plans. It was going to be used as an electric truck factory, but the demand isn’t great enough to expand production of BT1-based trucks and SUVs beyond Factory Zero in Michigan.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GM-Toledo-Plant-Ohio-EV-drive-unit-investment-announcement-September-2022.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 15:04:42.631106

The terminated awards were issued by six offices, including those for clean energy demonstrations, energy efficiency and renewable energy, grid deployment, manufacturing and energy supply chains, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and fossil energy.
Recently, DOE planned to return more than $13 billion that had been approved under the Biden administration to incentivize the development of renewable energy projects.
It added that the canceled projects did not adequately advance national energy needs, were not economically viable, and failed to demonstrate a positive return on investment.

The terminated awards were issued by six offices, including those for clean energy demonstrations, energy efficiency and renewable energy, grid deployment, manufacturing and energy supply chains, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and fossil energy.

Recently, DOE planned to return more than $13 billion that had been approved under the Biden administration to incentivize the development of renewable energy projects.

The DOE stated that the decision follows a detailed, individualized financial review to assess the economic and strategic value of projects funded through its various offices.

It added that the canceled projects did not adequately advance national energy needs, were not economically viable, and failed to demonstrate a positive return on investment.

Of the 321 awards, 26% were issued between November 6, 2024 (Election Day), and January 20, 2025 (Inauguration Day), a period DOE noted was marked by a rush of funding approvals. These awards alone were valued at more than $3.1 billion.

Chris Wright, the Secretary of Energy, stated that one of the department’s priorities was to review billions of dollars in financial awards, many of which were issued during the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation.

Wright said the cancellations reflect the current president, Donald Trump’s, directive to protect taxpayer resources while ensuring the expansion of affordable, reliable, and secure energy supplies in the U.S.

In May this year, Wright issued a memorandum titled “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” which established new guidelines for evaluating financial awards across the department.

The policy requires program offices to conduct case-by-case reviews of awards, request additional information from awardees when necessary, and assess projects against standards of economic viability, national security, and energy security. The new policy also prioritizes the safeguarding of taxpayer dollars while “advancing the administration’s commitment to affordable and reliable domestic energy.”

The DOE confirmed that, based on this evaluation framework, each of the 321 terminated awards was found to be inconsistent with its revised standards. As part of the process, award recipients have been granted 30 days to appeal the termination decision. The department noted that some of the affected projects have already initiated appeals.

In July, Trump signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to terminate the clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities and implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern restrictions identified in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Act.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-10-03T161714.723.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 17:01:54.834244

The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter and capacity of the project.
Indeed, FERC’s Environmental Analysis today concluded that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project proposed by Transco could technically, practically and economically eliminate the need for the proposed Southgate project.
With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Nov. 3, with no public hearings for residents along the route.
“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,“ said Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released an Environmental Assessment for the methane gas pipeline Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate, proposed for Virginia and North Carolina. The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s amendment request to change the route, pipe diameter and capacity of the project. Southgate would extend the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline from Pittsylvania County, Virginia, into Rockingham, North Carolina, and has faced significant opposition since it was originally proposed in 2018.

Project opponents contend a new application should be required, instead of an amendment, because the route, size and impact of this version of the project are different from the project for which FERC issued the original 2020 Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.

Adding to the significant concern about Southgate, the Williams Companies’ expansion of their Transco pipelines, called the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, is undergoing a simultaneous permitting process, with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality undergoing a Clean Water 401 permit review through Nov. 10, and FERC expected to release an Environmental Assessment of the project in early November. The pipelines companies have bickered publicly about their access to the area and the need for both pipelines. Indeed, FERC’s Environmental Analysis today concluded that the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project proposed by Transco could technically, practically and economically eliminate the need for the proposed Southgate project. The co-location of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines is of significant concern for local residents.

With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Nov. 3, with no public hearings for residents along the route. The lack of hearings and the limited comment period hinder meaningful public participation from those along the impacted route.

“Southgate necessitates a full application, not an insufficient amendment request and environmental assessment,“ said Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “Southgate’s developers inflicted harm on all communities within the path of their violation-riddled Mountain Valley Pipeline mainline, and should not be granted more permission to extend that harm into North Carolina.”

“During MVP Mainline construction, the pipeline’s developers were charged millions in fines for hundreds of violations,” said Dr. Crystal Cavalier-Keck, Co-Founder of 7 Directions of Service. “MVP's proposed extension of its pipeline into North Carolina — MVP Southgate — is now within half a mile of another dangerous proposed pipeline, Transco SSEP, and the burden on our communities will only be compounded. We deserve to be heard: FERC should extend the public comment period and reject MVP Southgate once and for all.”

“North Carolinians have never wanted Southgate,” said Caroline Hansley, Campaign Organizing Strategist with the Sierra Club. “The only ones who are pushing for this pipeline are the MVP developers who will make billions from polluting our communities’ air and water while harming our health. FERC must deny this amendment and protect our communities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:49.033735

The Gulf Energy Alliance, the American Petroleum Institute, and five Republican-led coastal states—including Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, and Mississippi—in January sued the Biden administration for withdrawing parts of the Gulf of Mexico and other waters from offshore oil and gas leasing. They said the withdrawal was unconstitutional and violated the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

President Donald Trump, shortly after taking office in January, rescinded Biden’s memorandum withdrawing those waters from leasing and has since reopened the eastern Gulf of Mexico and other coastal waters to fossil fuels development. Cain in May ruled the case wasn’t moot despite Trump reversing Biden’s withdrawals.

Cain ruled Thursday that Biden, and President Barack Obama before him, exceeded presidential authority when they withdrew large swaths of Outer Continental Shelf lands without an expiration date. He said the executive branch historically has only used withdrawal authority sparingly, and with expiration dates.

He partly granted the states’ motion for summary judgment, and fully granted a motion for summary judgment filed by the American Petroleum Institute, which argued the withdrawals violated OCSLA and the Supreme Court’s major questions doctrine.

Higher natural gas generation drove the slight increase in CO2 emissions, and a 3% increase in total nitrogen oxides (NOx). Total sulfur dioxide (SO2) decreased by 8%, according to the 2024 ISO New England Electric Generator Air Emissions Report.

The analysis, which draws information from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) databases and other sources, found that New England’s current power system emissions are well below those observed in the early 2000s and 2010s. Carbon dioxide emissions declined 20% between 2015 and 2024.

Report takeaways

Similar seasonal patterns between 2023 and 2024 kept year-over-year changes in carbon emissions relatively small.

Both 2023 and 2024 were characterized by mild winters and summers with few periods of tight system conditions. New England wholesale electricity demand was just 2% higher in 2024 than the historically low demand of the previous year. The region often relies on higher-emitting oil- and coal-fired generation to meet increased demand for cooling on very hot days, or to make up for natural gas pipeline constraints that can occur in very cold weather. These resources typically drive emissions higher.

Drought and extended nuclear outages in Canada contributed to a reduction in imports.

Ongoing drought in Québec, affecting hydropower, and an extended outage of nuclear resources in New Brunswick from April to December 2024 drove an overall reduction in Canadian imports. This contributed to an 8% increase in natural gas production year over year.

Increase in renewables continues, while nuclear returned to more normal operations.

Over the last 10 years, wind and solar generation in the region has more than doubled, making up 7% of the total energy generated in 2024. Wind and solar generation have now effectively replaced most coal and oil generation. Coal and oil generated just 0.5% of the total energy in 2024, compared to 3.6% in 2015. Nuclear, another key non-emitting resource type, returned to normal operations in 2024 after multiple planned refueling outages in 2023.

Emission rates for CO2, SO2, and NOx, which describe how many pounds of each pollutant are given off for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced, have seen double-digit declines over the past decade, dropping 20%, 82%, and 42% respectively. Emission rates were flat or down from 2023 to 2024.

By the numbers

The table below summarizes annual average emissions and emission rates for 2024, as well as the year-over-year changes from 2023. The table includes figures for emissions from New England generation, as well as data on emissions associated with New England generation plus electricity imported from other regions. More detailed results can be found in the report’s appendix.

About the data

The report’s emissions estimates for generation within New England are based on data from the EPA’s Clean Air Markets Program database and the agency’s eGRID database, New England Power Pool Generator Information System monthly data, or the ISO’s calculation of emission rates based on unit type and age. CO2 emission rates for imports are based on data from the eGRID database for the New York ISO and on Canada’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report.

“If the board decides to issue a positive declaration, we support that decision,” Terra-Gen attorney Robert Panasci said.

“We are confident in our application and confident that the comprehensive environmental studies that we’ve provided and the additional studies and information we can provide will lead to a full environmental review.”

Board members made the approval conditional on getting a letter with the promise that a state Environmental Quality Review Act positive declaration, which says the project is likely to have detrimental impacts, would not result in a court challenge. That requirement was met before the meeting was completed.

“Please be advised that (Terra-Gen subsidiary) Alcazar ESS, LLC will not commence litigation due to the fact that the Town Board is issuing a positive declaration under SEQRA,” Panasci wrote.

Under the now-expanded environmental review, there will be an information gathering period that will take in every concern that can be generated by the public in all potentially affected areas. Those concerns will go to the developer for responses, with the board then able to either draft a scoping document for action that is needed to be in a draft environmental impact statement, or declare that the response was incomplete because the developer did not provide enough information.

Among immediate concerns cited by the Town Board based on the application are:

• Potential impacts on threatened and endangered species, including proximity to a known northern long-eared bat hibernaculum within 3.5 miles of the site. That would require the developer to adjust its tree-clearing schedule.

• Possible historic and cultural impacts due to the former John A. Coleman Catholic High School being over 50 years old.

• Having a large-scale industrial energy facility immediately adjacent to residential neighborhoods.

• Potential visual, noise, and stormwater impacts that include grading, drainage and operational noise.

• Concern over public safety and emergency response capabilities to handle fire suppression and hazardous materials.

Town officials expect to meet with planning consultants to develop a timeline for when public sessions will be conducted and the period which comments can be submitted.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-052225-coleman-06-rotated.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-10-03 16:03:44.123336

The U.S. Supreme Court will be deciding a number of cases during the new nine-month session that begins Monday. These include issues like presidential powers, trade tariffs, transgender sportspeople, guns, race laws, campaign finance laws, gay ""conversion therapies"", religious rights, and capital punishment. The following are some of the cases that will be heard during the upcoming court term. Separately, the court has also acted in emergency cases involving challenges against President Donald Trump's policy. TRUMP TARIFFS A court has agreed that it will decide on the legality Trump's global tariffs. This is a major test for one of Trump's most bold assertions of executive authority, which has been at the heart of his economic and trading agenda. The Justice Department appealed the lower court ruling that Trump had overstepped his power in imposing his tariffs, which were imposed under a federal emergency law. This case could result in trillions of dollars worth of customs duties within the next decade. The lower court ruled Trump had overreached by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act in order to impose tariffs. This ruling was made in response to challenges from five small businesses as well as 12 U.S. States. A toy manufacturer will also be bringing a separate case. Arguments will be held on November 5. TRUMP'S FIRE OF FED OFFICIAL Justices will hear arguments about Trump's bid to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This is the first time a president has attempted to fire a Fed Official, as he questions the independence of the central bank. The court refused to decide immediately on a Justice Department's request to put a judge’s order temporarily blocking Trump from removing Cook. Congress created the Fed in 1913 and passed the Federal Reserve Act, which included provisions that shielded the central bank against political interference. The law required governors to only be removed ""for cause"" by the president, though it did not define this term or establish procedures for removal. The arguments are set for January but the exact date is not yet known. FIRE OF THE FEDERAL COMMISSION The Justices will hear arguments about Trump's firing a Democratic member from the Federal Trade Commission. This is a significant test of presidential authority over government agencies that Congress intended to be independent. The court allowed Trump to remove Rebecca Slaughter while the case is still pending. Slaughter filed a lawsuit after she was dismissed from the Consumer Protection and Antitrust Agency before her term expired in 2029. This case offers the court the chance to overrule an important precedent that dates back 90 years, upholding job-protection measures put in place by Congress for federal agency heads to have some independence from the presidential control. The judge rejected the argument of the administration that tenure protections illegally infringe on presidential powers. The arguments are set for December but the exact date is not yet known. TRANSGENDER SPORTS PARTICIPATION The court will hear Idaho and West Virginia's bid to enforce state laws that ban transgender athletes in female sports teams within public schools. This is another civil rights challenge against Republican-backed restrictions for transgender individuals. Idaho and West Virginia appealed lower court decisions siding with transgender plaintiffs. Plaintiffs argued the laws discriminate based upon sex or transgender status, in violation of U.S. Constitution 14th Amendment equal protection guarantee and Title IX civil right statute which prohibits sex discrimination in schools. The arguments have not been scheduled. The Justices agreed to hear the challenge of a Christian counselor on free speech grounds against a Democratic-backed Colorado Law banning ""conversion therapies"" that are intended to change a child's sexual orientation. The counselor appealed the lower court's ruling that rejected her claim that a 2019 Colorado statute violated the First Amendment by censoring her communications with her clients. The state claims it regulates professional conduct and not speech. According to court documents, the counselor is a Christian who believes that people ""flourish when they live in accordance with God's plan, including their biological gender."" Arguments will be held on October 7. HAWAII GUNS LAW The court took up the challenge of a Hawaii gun law that restricts the carrying handguns in public places, such as businesses. This gave the court the opportunity to expand gun rights. Three Hawaii residents who hold concealed carry licenses, and a gun rights group based in Honolulu appealed the lower court's ruling that Hawaii's measure is likely to comply with the U.S. Constitution Second Amendment right of keep and bear arms. Hawaii's concealed carry law requires that licensees obtain the owner's permission before bringing their handguns onto public property. The arguments have not been scheduled. CAMPAIGN FUNDING The court agreed to hear the Republican-led challenge, on free speech grounds, to a federal campaign finance provision that limits spending by parties in coordination and cooperation with candidates for office. This case involved Vice President JDVance. Vance and two Republican committees, both of whom were running for U.S. Senate at the time the litigation started, appealed the ruling by a lower court that limited the amount of money political parties could spend on campaigns, with the input of candidates they supported. The question is whether the federal restrictions on coordinated campaign expenditures violate First Amendment protections against government abridgment. The arguments have not been scheduled. LOUISIANA ELECTORAL DISTRECTS The court will again hear arguments in a dispute involving a Louisiana election map that increased the number of U.S. Congress districts with a majority of Black people in the state. The court will be assessing the legality a key element of the 1965 Voting Right Act that was meant to prevent racial bias in voting. Justices heard arguments on March 24, but ordered on June 27 that the matter be debated again. State officials and civil right groups appealed an earlier court ruling which found that the map of Louisiana's six U.S. House of Representatives district - now with two Black majority districts instead of one - was in violation of the Constitution's equal protection promise. Arguments will be held on October 15. CRISIS PREGNANCY COUNTER The court will examine whether to revive a New Jersey operator of a crisis pregnancy center's attempt to stop the Democratic-led attorney general's investigation into whether the Christian faith based organization misled women into thinking it offered abortions. First Choice Women's Resource Centers has appealed the ruling of a lower court that said the organization had to contest the attorney general's summons in state court first before filing a federal suit. The crisis pregnancy centers offer services to pregnant woman with the aim of preventing abortions. They do not promote their anti-abortion views. First Choice argues that it has the right to take its case to federal court, because it alleges a violation of First Amendment rights for free speech and freedom of association. The arguments have not been scheduled. EXXON CLAIMS CUBA COMPENSATION Justices will hear ExxonMobil’s bid to get compensation from Cuban state owned firms for oil assets seized by Cuban communists in 1960. The law allows Americans to sue foreign companies or individuals over confiscated property. Exxon appealed the ruling of a lower court that undermined its legal efforts to obtain compensation from Cuban companies who allegedly profited by stolen property. The lawsuit invoked a 1996 U.S. Law called Helms-Burton Act. The court also heard a similar request by a Delaware registered company that had built port facilities at Havana that were seized by Cuba in 1960. It wanted to reinstate $440 million of judgments against Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and two other cruise companies that used the terminal. The arguments have not been scheduled. RASTAFARIAN INMATES The justices heard a Rastafarian's case to sue Louisiana prison officials for shaven him bald and holding him down in violation of religious beliefs. Damon Landor's religion dictates that he let his hair grow. He appealed the lower court decision to dismiss his lawsuit filed under a U.S. statute protecting against religious infringements by local and state governments. Landor was not allowed to sue officials individually for damages under this law, according to the lower court. The law in question protects religious rights for people who are confined in institutions like prisons and jails. The arguments are scheduled for 10 November. DEATH ROW INMATES The court will hear the appeal of Alabama officials against a ruling that an intellectually-disabled man who was convicted of murder in 1997, but spared from death penalty. They are pressing ahead with their bid to execute the Republican-governed State. According to the lower court's analysis of Joseph Clifton Smith's IQ scores and expert testimony, he was deemed intellectually disabled. According to a Supreme Court decision from 2002, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unjust punishment is violated by executing a person with intellectual disabilities. The arguments are scheduled for 4 November. COX COMMUNICATIONS PIRACY VERDICT Justices heard a dispute over copyright between Cox Communications, a music label group and the court after a judge threw out an $1 billion jury verdict that had been pronounced against Cox Communications for alleged music piracy by Cox's customers. Cox Communications appealed the lower court decision that it would still be liable for any copyright violations by its customers despite the ruling overturning the verdict. Sony Music, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group are among the labels. The arguments have not been scheduled. CHEVRON AND XXON COASTAL POLLLUTION The court agreed to hear an application by Chevron and Exxon Mobil, as well as other oil and gas firms to move lawsuits filed by two Louisiana municipalities accusing them of damaging the state's coastline over a decade-long period to federal court. The companies appealed the lower court's decision rejecting their claim that the lawsuits should be heard in federal court, because the parishes Plaquemines & Cameron were suing for oil production undertaken during World War Two to fulfill U.S. Government refinery contracts. Federal court is regarded as a more friendly venue for such litigation. Arguments have not been scheduled.

Hotels are a major factor in countries' decision to skip the COP30 climate conference

Hundreds of hotel rooms are in short supply, and prices have risen to hundreds of dollars a night. Two European nations have said that they are considering not attending Belem at all. The organisers of COP30 are racing to convert cruise ships, love motels and churches into accommodations for the 45,000 expected delegates. Brazil held the climate talks in Belem because it has an average of 18,000 hotel rooms available. It hoped that its location at the edge the Amazon rainforest, would draw attention to the threats climate change poses to the ecosystem and its role as a sink for climate warming emissions. LATVIA SAYS THAT ROOMS ARE EXPENSIVE The Latvian climate minister said that the country had asked its negotiators if they could dial in via video call. Melnis stated, ""We've already decided that it is too expensive for us."" It's the very first time that it is so expensive. ""We have a duty to the budget of our country."" Lithuania, a second country in eastern Europe, has also indicated that it will not be staying after receiving quotes for prices exceeding $500 per person, per night. A Lithuanian energy minister spokesperson, who covers climate issues, stated that the quality and legitimacy of negotiations would be affected if governments were unable to attend due to the cost. According to a spokesperson for Brazil's COP30 Presidency, the decision is up to each country. COP30 HOTEL PRICE LEAVES DELEGATES OUT OF POCKET The website displayed rates ranging from $360 to 4,400 per night, just days after Brazil launched a booking platform at the beginning of August. The platform displayed prices starting at $150 per night this week. The host country rejected calls to move the summit, saying it would provide 15 hotel rooms at a price of less than $220 per night for each delegation from a developing country and below $600 per night for any wealthy delegation. The United Nations also increased their subsidy for low-income countries to attend. According to Brazil's Presidency of COP30, less than six weeks before COP30, there are still 81 countries in negotiations about hotel rooms, while 87 have already reserved accommodation. Evans Njewa is the chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, which represents the poorest countries in the U.N. Climate Talks. He said that the group was still assessing the attendance plans. Njewa said: ""We receive a large volume of concerns... and many requests for assistance."" ""Unfortunately, our capacity is restricted, which could affect the size and composition of delegations."" CLIMATE ACTION UNDER THREATEN The COP summit this year takes place as the U.S. president Donald Trump seeks to shift America's focus away from climate change and Europe's priorities are changing due to its struggling economies. Ilana Seid said that the lack of affordable housing placed her members at ""a severe disadvantage"". The small island states have taken advantage of previous COPs in order to get more funding for climate change adaptation. Seid stated that smaller delegations would not allow island nations to ""participate effectively in the negotiations that decide our future"" because they lack the expertise required.

Exxon's compensation claim to Cuban entities will be heard by the US Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear ExxonMobil’s request for compensation from Cuban state owned firms. These assets were seized by Cuban government-owned companies in 1960. This was done under a federal statute that allows Americans to sue foreign individuals and companies over confiscated property. The Justices heard Exxon's appeal against a lower-court ruling that undermined its legal efforts to obtain compensation from Cuban companies who allegedly profited by stealing property. The court also heard a similar request by a Delaware registered company that had built port facilities in Havana that were seized by Cuba in 1960. It sought to reinstate $440 million of judgments against Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, and two other cruise companies that used the terminal. On Monday, the Supreme Court will begin its new nine-month session. Exxon's dispute is about the former Cuban leader Fidel Cuba's confiscation all its oil and natural gas assets in Cuba. This loss, valued at over $700 million now, was caused by Castro. Cuba has not paid Exxon any compensation, but the Helms-Burton Act gives the oil company the opportunity to sue in a U.S. Court for damages. Helms-Burton Act gives U.S. citizens who own property in Cuba the right to sue any person who ""traffics property that was confiscated by Cuban government on or after 1 January 1959."" The Helms-Burton Act also allows the U.S. President to suspend this provision if it is deemed necessary to ""protect the national interest of the United States."" Exxon sued three Cuban state owned companies in 2019 for compensation, claiming that they continue to profit from their stolen property. These Cuban state-owned firms are Corporacion Cimex S.A., S.A., (Cuba), Corporacion Cimex S.A., (Panama), and Union Cuba-Petroleo. The litigation lasted for years, focusing on jurisdictional issues rather than liability. The U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, concluded that plaintiffs bringing Helms-Burton Act cases must satisfy an exemption under a separate U.S. law: the Foreign Sovereign immunity Act. This act shields foreign governments against lawsuits in the United States unless there is an exception. Havana Docks Corporation, in the cruise line dispute, sued four cruise lines in Florida federal court in 2019. Havana Docks constructed piers in the port before the Cuban Revolution, which took place in the 1950s. It is now seeking compensation from cruise operators for using the property between 2016 and 2019. Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader, nationalized and expropriated U.S. property shortly after he came to power in 1959. This included Havana Docks which held a concession granted by Cuba in 1934 for a 99-year period of construction and operation at the Havana port. Cuba has not paid compensation to Havana Docks. However, the Helms-Burton Act gives the company the opportunity to sue in U.S. courts for damages. A federal judge ruled the cruise lines were guilty of trafficking for docking their ships at the terminal. Each of the four companies was fined more than $100,000,000. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Atlanta, threw out these judgments last year. It found that Havana Docks did not have a viable claim because its concession would have expired in 2004, well before the cruise lines used the facilities. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Atlanta, threw these judgments out last year. It found that Havana Docks had no claim since its concession expired in 2004, long before cruise ships used the facilities. Both parties of the U.S. presidency chose to suspend the law. This meant that private lawsuits were not allowed to proceed. In 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, he lifted the suspension. This triggered a new wave of lawsuits in U.S. courtrooms against Cuban state owned entities and some American companies accused of trafficking confiscated property.",https://energynews.oedigital.com/img/energy-news-sqr.svg,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:14.487324

One particularly notable award is up to $1.2 billion that would go to advance hydrogen energy in California.
The Trump administration has been seeking to pressure Democrats to pass a bill to fund the government, including by threatening to fire federal workers.

The Energy Department announced late Wednesday it was cutting awards that funded 223 projects, axing about $7.56 billion in spending.

In a social media post ahead of the announcement, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the funding cuts would take place for projects in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought, in his post, categorized the projects as “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

All of those states went for former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election, and most of them have Democratic governors.

However, a breakdown released by congressional Democrats indicates some of the canceled funds are for projects located in states that did not vote for Harris: Tennessee, South Carolina, North Dakota, Iowa and Florida.

The funding being canceled was slated to go to a variety of recipients. One particularly notable award is up to $1.2 billion that would go to advance hydrogen energy in California.

That money was awarded as one of several regional “hubs” funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to promote energy that comes from hydrogen atoms.

“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned. Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), a likely 2028 presidential candidate, in a written statement. A press release from his office said the move threatens 200,000 jobs.

A major $1 billion in funding for hydrogen power in the Pacific Northwest was also canceled, but other hydrogen hubs in states including West Virginia and Pennsylvania appear to be untouched.

The cancellations come amid a government shutdown in which partisan tensions are particularly high. The Trump administration has been seeking to pressure Democrats to pass a bill to fund the government, including by threatening to fire federal workers. Meanwhile, Democrats are insisting on passing legislation aimed at bringing down healthcare costs along with any funding bill.

Among the companies losing funding are utilities such as Commonwealth Edison, Xcel Energy, Exelon, General Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric. Also losing out are companies that produce solar energy, electric vehicles and hydrogen power — among others.

In addition, funding is being canceled for the Gas Technology Institute, which has said it received significant government funding with the aim of reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production.

Sen. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the Trump moves “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful” in a written statement.

“These are projects that Congress already approved and funded — projects that create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward. Instead of working to help our families and communities, the Trump Administration is tearing these projects down, driving up energy bills for families, and putting hardworking people in New Mexico and across the country out of work,” Heinrich said.

The Energy Department said in its press release that the 321 awards which would have gone to the 223 projects were being canceled after a “thorough, individualized financial review.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress in May that previously-funded projects were being reviewed on a variety of criteria, including whether they align with the Trump administration’s agenda.

Now, Wright said in a written statement that the cancellations came as part of an effort to “protect taxpayer dollars.”

The department said that 26 percent of the awards it was cancelling were issued by the Biden administration between the election and President Trump’s inauguration – and that these awards alone were worth more than $3.1 billion.

It’s not clear what the administration will do with the funds it is clawing back, if anything. The department did not answer The Hill’s question about what would happen to the money.",https://www.wdtn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2025/10/Barriers_080825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-03 15:04:23.229319

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members wrote.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA’s policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

Speaking at Ford’s “Pro Accelerate” event in Detroit, Farley painted a scenario that feels more like a rewind than progress: electric vehicles could represent just 5% of the US car market, the same level seen back in 2022. That’s a sharp contrast to the optimistic 10–12% market share forecasted for this month.

The message is blunt. The sector may not just slow down but actually shrink, becoming “smaller, much smaller,” as Farley put it. The reasons? Not only the disappearance of the credit but also shifting emissions policies that make long-term planning a logistical headache.

For Ford, this translates into a giant question mark. How do you make use of factories and battery plants built for a demand that’s suddenly shaky?

This is what environmental justice — the idea that all people, regardless of race, gender, or income, have the right to the same environmental protections — aims to rectify.
“This is the first time that we've had a policy that we're going to put in place for environmental justice,” said Liat Meitzenheimer, the president of Fresh Air Vallejo.
“The people need to be informed [about environmental justice] to be able to make good decisions,” Diaz said.","VALLEJO – Vallejo is one step closer to incorporating environmental justice into its general plan — a comprehensive, long-term blueprint that guides how the city will grow and develop until 2040.

The new effort was announced Wednesday evening at an event hosted by the environmental justice organization Fresh Air Vallejo at the Norman C. King South Vallejo Community Center. The project, dubbed “EJ4Vallejo,” is a partnership with the city that will involve scheduling community meetings, brainstorming solutions, and collecting stories and data so that the needs of the community are reflected in any future land use projects and climate resiliency strategies.

The project will run until winter 2026. “The ultimate impact, we hope, is a more empowered community that’s capable of influencing city planning,” said Lorene Allio, a member of Fresh Air Vallejo.

This is all part of the city falling into compliance with California Senate Bill 1000, which went into effect in 2018. SB 1000 requires that local governments engage with the community to identify “disadvantaged communities,” which are areas that experience compounding health risks due to pollution exposure and issues like food insecurity, unsafe homes, and inequitable access to resources. The law also requires that local governments promote civic engagement so that these affected communities have input into future policy decisions.

The California Environmental Protection Agency has a tool that maps out these areas. The data shows that people of color, particularly Latino and Black people, disproportionately bear the burden of living in high pollution areas. The most impacted neighborhoods are 91% people of color, while the least impacted neighborhoods are 67% white.

The disparity is a result of decades of redlining and systemic racism, with communities of color often pushed to live by freeways or refineries. This is what environmental justice — the idea that all people, regardless of race, gender, or income, have the right to the same environmental protections — aims to rectify.

“This is the first time that we've had a policy that we're going to put in place for environmental justice,” said Liat Meitzenheimer, the president of Fresh Air Vallejo. “We want the city to improve, but we want all of the city to improve, not just certain locations.”

Meitzenheimer pointed out that the meeting was held in South Vallejo, which has inordinately high rates of asthma. According to the data agency the Population Reference Bureau, Solano County has the highest rate of childhood asthma in the state. And South Vallejo had nearly triple the rate of asthma emergency room visits compared to the state average in 2023, per the California Department of Public Health.

“You can't be in school and learn if you can't breathe,” Meitzenheimer said. “So it's important for us to identify the areas of the city and look ahead into the future and plan so we can mitigate some of these problems and make the quality of life better for all citizens.”

Louis Michael, the project coordinator for Fresh Air Vallejo and a public health student at Touro University, said these issues hit home for him because his wife grew up in South Vallejo and she has asthma, and now he has two kids here.

“Real people are being impacted by these issues,” Michael said. “It really is something I care about a lot because I want to create a community and a city that is addressing these issues so that in the future, my kids, and their kids, and my great grandkids, don't have to worry about going outside because the air that they're breathing is polluted.”

The event was attended by Councilmember Helen-Marie “Cookie” Gordon, as well as city long-range planning manager Hector Rojas. There were also several local organizations in attendance that have partnered with Fresh Air Vallejo to engage and inform the community.

One of those organizations was Diaz & Loera Centro Latino, founded by former City Councilmember Mina Diaz. As a longtime activist, Diaz was immediately interested in the initiative, and said it’s important to include the voices of immigrant and Latino communities, as well as youth. To that end, she advocated for having two Spanish translators at the event for the main presentation; the slides also had both English and Spanish text.

“The people need to be informed [about environmental justice] to be able to make good decisions,” Diaz said. “We need to have this information out in different languages because if a child gets sick, it doesn't discriminate by what race they are.”

Ken Szutu, the founder of the Vallejo Citizen Air Monitoring Network, was there to showcase one of their outdoor sensors, which measures how much particulate matter is in the air, like dust and smoke. Szutu said there are more than 25 sensors positioned around Vallejo, and they connect to the PurpleAir app, which residents can then use to check air quality.

There was also the NAACP Vallejo chapter in attendance. Patricia Hunter, the president of the Vallejo branch, explained that their organization will also be hosting meetings in partnership with this initiative.

Hunter said it’s important to have “trusted messengers” within the community to share information about issues like environmental justice. She said it’s especially important to educate the youth about these issues.

“That’s what we’re here to do, educate and advocate,” Hunter said.

That ethos was echoed by the Center for Urban Excellence, which empowers systems-impacted youth through art, wellness, and workforce development programs. Their organization is not only involved with getting youth engaged in conversations around environmental justice, but also in helping them see the possibility for a greener future.

“We know that green energy jobs, and jobs that focus on sustainability, are the future of not only Solano County and Vallejo, but really the nation,” said Reina Robinson, the CEO of the Center for Urban Excellence. “So we have shifted a lot of our career pathways and our focus is on helping people find those kinds of forward thinking careers.”

Robinson added that the “EJ4Vallejo” project resonates because she grew up with asthma as well. She said there were many times that she fell asleep as a kid and woke up in the hospital because her mom said she couldn’t breathe. “That happened more times than I could count,” she said.

She said that many of the families they serve often feel “voiceless” when it comes to issues as simple as asking their landlords to change out the air filters in the apartment so that they can breathe better.

“The messed up part of it is that as people of color, as poor people, we often know we’re going to get the worst of it because we don't have that political power,” Robinson said.

The “EJ4Vallejo” project is hoping to change that. “For the community to be healthy, we have to have both clear information and clear policy that really reflects the community experience and the community voice,” Allio said. “That's the basics.”",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/environmentaljusticemap_ejvallejo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:08.231262

Attorneys general in Wyoming, Montana and 14 other conservative states are alleging big-name tech companies are misleading consumers about their support for green energy.

In a letter to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft dated Sept. 24, the attorneys general accused them of using “environmental accounting gimmicks” to say they’re powered by renewables.

“These claims appear deceptive given the increasing electricity demands of those companies and the realities of the U.S. electrical grid,” the letter says, before requesting the companies answer a series of questions about their energy use, policies and claims.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.

“The attorney generals are questioning the longstanding way we’ve done things,” said John Rogers, associate director of energy analytics at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Rogers said companies don’t always have control over where utilities get power. So, they may buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar or wind farms to be more green and offset their energy use.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn’t make them “powered by” renewables. A spokesperson from Amazon said this reliance on RECs is temporary.

“Amazon purchases RECs as a temporary bridging mechanism while we wait for renewable energy projects to come online,” the spokesperson wrote via email.

Rogers said buying RECs fuels more demand for renewables.

“You can be forcing action elsewhere in the market,” he explained.

The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

“These utility commitments have helped contribute to the phenomenon of early retirement of coal and natural gas plants, which is raising state concerns and threatening the integrity of the electric grid,” the letter reads.

The attorneys general also say that this threatens President Donald Trump’s efforts to “unleash American energy.”

Rogers said these points may suggest the state officials have ulterior motives.

“Their interest may not be entirely about ensuring the integrity of renewable energy markets and more about propping up fossil fuels,” he said.

The letter asks companies to respond to Montana’s Officer of Consumer Protection by Oct. 27.

The spokesperson from Amazon said the company has received the letter and is reviewing it. A representative for Microsoft said no comment. Google and Meta did not respond by deadline.

INDIANAPOLIS — Attorney General Todd Rokita and Indiana Department of Environmental Management Commissioner Clint Woods are championing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to repeal climate regulations for cars and trucks that they say hurt Hoosiers and the economy. The regulations, which cost Americans $54 billion annually, rest on the Obama EPA’s 2009 decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Rokita said the regulations restrict Hoosiers’ ability to access affordable, reliable vehicles and hurt Indiana’s small businesses in the manufacturing and industrial industries.

“These rules are a bureaucratic power grab that burdens hardworking Hoosiers and families with unaffordable regulations,” Rokita said. “By scrapping it, the EPA would be restoring common sense, the rule of law and American energy independence. We fully support the rollback to restore polices that put our country back on the path to prosperity and protect Hoosier workers.”

The letter, submitted last week, argues the Obama EPA misused a statute that Congress designed in the 1960s and 1970s to tackle local problems like smog, not global warming. Recent Supreme Court decisions have been that EPA cannot regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases based on “speculative concerns about their indirect effects on the environment,” the news release said.

Rokita said the rule’s science is shaky, relying on outdated predictions that overstate CO2’s impact.

As Indiana’s lead environmental regulator, Woods emphasized IDEM’s success in balancing air quality gains with economic growth.

“The U.S. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding and its resulting greenhouse gas regulations exceed the agency’s limited authority under the Clean Air Act and suffer from significant scientific, procedural and legal defects,” said Woods. “Given Indiana’s primary responsibility for air pollution control, its proven track record of improving air quality, and its bottom-up success in reducing greenhouse gases without federal overreach, IDEM strongly supports reconsidering these heavy-handed standards that impose costs on Hoosiers without delivering measurable environmental benefits.”

McNeill said the same thing would happen in the US, given how popular EVs have become in the country. Motor Intelligence, an auto data firm, said in January that EV and hybrid vehicles made up 20% of new car and truck sales in the US last year.

""The market's established, and we're probably ready to have a market that can grow without subsidies,"" McNeill said on Thursday.

""We are offering lower-priced EVs, which is definitely having a positive impact on this market growing,"" he added.

McNeill did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In July, Congress passed President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which eliminated federal EV incentives. This included a $7,500 consumer tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for used EVs. Both schemes expired on September 30.

The ruling does not, however, insulate the Agency from future challenges, particularly if it denies or delays petitions seeking new biosolids regulations.","Overview

On September 29, 2025, the US District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a lawsuit brought by Texas farmers, multi-state environmental organizations, and Johnson County, Texas that alleged the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA or the Agency) failure to regulate polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sewage sludge used as fertilizer (biosolids) violates federal law, leaving communities vulnerable to ""forever chemicals"" in agricultural products and water supplies. The case, Farmer v. EPA, was originally filed in 2024 after farmers claimed their property, livestock, and health were harmed when PFAS-laden biosolids from neighboring fields migrated onto their land. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief compelling EPA to identify specific PFAS in biosolids as pollutants and regulate them under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The Complaint

The plaintiffs alleged that EPA had shirked non-discretionary duties under the CWA by failing to identify 18 PFAS chemicals (Table 1 PFAS) as pollutants in its most recent biennial biosolids review and by failing to regulate 11 PFAS previously identified in earlier reports (Table 2 PFAS). Table 1 lists eighteen specific PFAS that plaintiffs allege EPA failed to identify in its most recent Biosolids Biennial Report No. 9, despite available scientific evidence showing their presence in concentrations that may affect public health or the environment due to their toxicity, persistence, concentration, mobility, or potential for exposure. Table 2 of the complaint lists PFAS that, according to the plaintiffs, EPA identified as present in sewage sludge as early as its 2012-2013 Biennial Review (No. 5), but for which EPA has also failed to promulgate required regulations despite sufficient evidence of risk. They argued that the Agency’s omissions violate the CWA’s requirement that EPA review sewage sludge regulations at least every two years “for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutants” and were arbitrary and capricious under the APA.

The Court’s Reasoning

The court rejected those arguments, emphasizing the distinction between EPA’s biennial duty to review existing biosolids regulations and any subsequent obligation to identify or regulate additional pollutants. The statutory language, the court held, imposes a clear duty only to perform the review itself, not to identify or regulate new contaminants. Because Congress did not set a “date-certain deadline” for regulation, plaintiffs could not invoke the CWA’s citizen-suit provision to compel EPA action.

With respect to the APA, the court determined that neither EPA’s biennial report nor the Agency’s failure to include certain PFAS in that report constituted “final Agency action.” The report, the court noted, is informational in nature, expressly disclaiming any binding effect on regulated entities. A decision not to list a pollutant in the report does not amount to a refusal to regulate and carries no independent legal consequences. Plaintiffs therefore failed to establish the kind of finality required for APA review. Ultimately, the court dismissed the CWA claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the APA claims for failure to state a claim, and the plaintiffs’ “unreasonable delay” claims after plaintiffs themselves conceded dismissal was appropriate.

Broader Implications

EPA has identified PFAS in sewage sludge in past reviews but has not promulgated regulations specific to these substances and, in fact, has not identified new pollutants since 1993. While EPA has issued nine biennial biosolids reviews since 2005, identifying hundreds of chemicals, including 11 PFAS, it has not moved forward with new regulatory standards. The court’s ruling reinforces EPA’s discretion in the timing and scope of regulation, and also signals to stakeholders that meaningful legal challenges may only become viable after EPA denies a formal rulemaking petition.

The dismissal also leaves in place a regulatory gap concerning PFAS in biosolids, which some states have recently moved to close. Maine and Connecticut have banned the land application of biosolids, while Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Vermont have promulgated regulations that require sampling of biosolids and/or establish specific PFAS limits for land application.

Conclusion

The decision provides clarity for regulated entities that courts will not compel EPA to accelerate PFAS regulation through litigation premised on the biennial review requirement. The ruling does not, however, insulate the Agency from future challenges, particularly if it denies or delays petitions seeking new biosolids regulations. Moreover, EPA’s draft biosolids risk assessment, issued by the Biden Administration on January 14, demonstrated risks exceeding EPA’s acceptable thresholds for every human exposure pathway. If the draft risk assessment is finalized, which is certainly not guaranteed because of numerous criticisms concerning the draft’s modeling assumptions, it may require regulatory action. That, however, could be years away. For industries involved in biosolids management, agriculture, and wastewater treatment, the case highlights both the complexity of PFAS regulation and the importance of monitoring evolving state-level initiatives, as state biosolids regulation is likely to be driven by states for the foreseeable future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16215_5618.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:02:12.364896

Drill baby drill is not going to happen at these prices. U.S. firms need $70 oil to increase the search for new wells. In fact, the rig count continues to decline. Firms are already laying off employees. If Trump gets $50 oil, there will be massive layoffs. It will take years to rebuild the employee base. (We have seen this time and again in the Permian Basin).

Can you say more about what you were reported on, what this may mean for a solution for Settegast residents?","For the last three years, an air control monitor maintained by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has detected some of the state’s dirtiest air in Settegast, a northeast Houston neighborhood.

The monitor shows high levels of an air pollutant known as PM2.5, an extremely tiny particle that can lodge itself deep within the lungs.

Rebekah Ward, climate an environment reporter for the Houston Chronicle, spoke to Texas Standard about how the air effects the residents of Settegast. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So I understand PM2.5, some kind of particulate pollutant, is much smaller than a grain of sand, but can you give us a sense of how the size may factor into just how harmful this pollutant might be for residents?

Rebekah Ward: Absolutely. So PM2.5, sometimes just known as soot, is essentially very small particles of solid or liquid that are so small that they can penetrate deep into the airways. And because they can penetrate deep into your body, they can cause a lot more severe health effects than larger particles that you might more easily be able to see.

The components of smoke that are more visible might not be able to penetrate as deeply, whereas the ones that are so tiny you can’t even see them are actually able to penetrate more deeply and can therefore cause a lot more cardiac problems, lung problems.

Yeah, I was going to ask you about the health effects, because Settegast residents have been living under poor air quality conditions for years. Can you say more about what this means for those living in this neighborhood?

So it’s actually… It’s interesting because Settegast, it is an old neighborhood in Houston and it is the neighborhood with the lowest life expectancy in Harris County.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that that low life expectancy is because of this pollution. However, a lot of the things that people are dying from, including things like cancer, are worsened or made more probable when you breathe in large amounts of PM2.5.

The state has yet to have any answers for Settegast residents because of, as I understand it, some sort of technicality. Can you say more about that technicality and what it would take to improve the air quality for this community?

So many individual, small industrial facilities do need to seek permits from our state environmental agency. And that state environmental agency, when a county does have sort of an overage above the federal standard of the levels of PM2.5 that that county is emitting, they can take specific actions to control that.

That can include, you know, limitations on some of the producers of PM2.5, the industrial producers in neighborhoods like Settegast. But in the case of Harris County, because the monitor in Settegast is actually quite recent – it was only installed a little over three years ago, and it takes three years of continuous data to even determine if you’re out of compliance with the federal standard and then another potentially six years before they have to start implementing any plan to make it better…

That’s a long time for people to live with pollution after they realize how bad it is.

I understand, historically, Houston residents have had to deal with another air pollutant that causes health issues. Can you say more about what you were reported on, what this may mean for a solution for Settegast residents?

Another pollutant that Houston residents have long had to deal with high ozone levels. And ozone is a pollutant that forms in the atmosphere. So some of the same polluters contribute to both PM2.5 and ozone, such as car exhaust has both particulate matter and it has the [volatile organic compounds] VOCs that contribute to ozone pollution.

But the fact that for years, Harris County has been out of compliance with the federal ozone standard and has not yet since it fell out of compliance, been able to bring those levels back down, does not necessarily bode well for its ability to bring us under the threshold for PM2.5.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SettegastHoustonTXSign-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:00.519720

Key takeaways Demand is global: The conference emphasised a fundamental reframing of the UK's clean energy goals.

Place matters for ambition: South Yorkshire is a critical hub for the UK’s energy ambitions.","Leaders from government, industry and cutting-edge research gathered in South Yorkshire for a landmark summit showcasing the region's pivotal role in the nation’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.

Hundreds of delegates from across South Yorkshire and beyond joined the UK Clean Energy Summit 2025, hosted by the University of Sheffield and its Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), at the Magna Science Adventure Centre in Rotherham on 12 September.

With the Summit focussed on accelerating the journey to net-zero while capitalising on clean energy’s potential to boost the economy, create jobs and attract investment, Secretary of State for Energy, Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband set the tone with a special video message:

“My single most important message is that I accept your invitation to work with you to seize the huge opportunities clean energy presents in South Yorkshire, and indeed our country as a whole,” he said.

“Our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower is about delivering energy security, lower bills and the good jobs and growth that we know people want, and protecting our home for our children and grandchildren.”

With opening addresses from University of Sheffield Vice-Chancellor Professor Koen Lamberts and South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard, the summit delved into key challenges and opportunities in the clean energy sector.

Professor Lamberts said: “The government has a clear mission: to cement our country’s position as a global clean energy superpower. But this isn't just about hitting a net-zero target. It is about seizing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to turbocharge national and regional growth. To create high-value jobs, build thriving businesses and attract significant investment.

“Everyone in this room has a role to play in achieving that, and that is the focus of today. How can we maximise the power of collaboration to overcome challenges and turn our ambitions into reality?

“South Yorkshire may have powered the first industrial revolution with steel and coal, but it is now home to the largest clean-tech cluster in the UK. As a region, we stand ready to play our part in powering our country’s future growth and prosperity. And it is a role we take seriously at the University of Sheffield.”

Professor Lamberts also highlighted the many clean energy initiatives the University is leading or partnered in, which are already creating jobs and driving economic growth in the region and beyond. These projects span a range of areas, including sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and small modular reactors.

Ben Morgan, interim CEO at the AMRC, said: “When we set out to organise the UK Clean Energy Summit, our focus was on leveraging this once-in-a-lifetime clean energy mission to deliver tangible impact: more and better jobs, greater investment and a more prosperous future for the next generation.

“The summit has proven that the North has the assets, the skilled workforce and the ambition to be the engine of this new green industrial revolution.

“This is not the time for business-as-usual approaches but rather an extraordinary collaborative effort to translate that ambition into action, ensuring our supply chains are prepared, our skill pathways are robust and our communities can capture the full economic benefits of this moment.”

South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard praised the University and its AMRC for working “hand-in-hand” with industry to help develop and build the future of clean energy, while reiterating the importance of the sense of dignity and purpose that good jobs and a thriving economy can bring.

“Today, as we gather to shape the next chapter of the UK's clean energy journey, I just want to leave you with this: now is the time to be bold for places like South Yorkshire, to once again forge and power a new industrial revolution,” said Mr Coppard.

“We'll only do that by doing it together, and rooting that work in place. And I want to ensure that the clean energy transition is not just a national ambition but wherever you are in the country, a local success.”

Lively and informative panel discussions followed, focussing on building a globally-oriented UK nuclear energy and small modular reactor (SMR) supply chain, harnessing hydrogen technology and capitalising on the significant economic benefits of clean energy.

Steve Bagshaw CBE, Chair, High Value Manufacturing Catapult, said: “The clean energy transition presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform our manufacturing landscape, in South Yorkshire and the whole of the UK. To capitalise, we must harness innovation and collaboration across our supply chains so we can ramp up productivity and global competitiveness.

""With the ambition set out in the government's modern industrial strategy, alongside the support of Innovate UK, we can position UK manufacturers at the forefront of the global net zero revolution, driving economic growth, creating skilled jobs and reinforcing our role as a world leader in sustainable energy solutions, from nuclear SMRs to offshore wind and hydrogen.""

Key takeaways

Demand is global:

The conference emphasised a fundamental reframing of the UK's clean energy goals. Instead of focusing solely on meeting domestic needs, the primary ambition should be to become a global leader. This means aiming to capture a significant share of the worldwide demand to build a scalable, sustainable and export-led industry.

From projects to production:

To seize this global opportunity, the UK's industrial culture must evolve. This means a crucial shift from a project-based mindset centred on building bespoke, one-off solutions, to a production-based one that establishes repeatable, large-scale manufacturing processes needed to compete internationally.

The supply chain bottleneck:

Demand for clean energy technologies will soon outstrip supply. This is a direct call for the UK's industrial base to get ready now. It's about practical scale-up, capacity and modernisation to overcome inevitable bottlenecks and lean into the challenges despite competition for resources.

Place matters for ambition:

South Yorkshire is a critical hub for the UK’s energy ambitions. With over 250 companies in the region to supply into global markets and the presence of world-class institutions like the AMRC and University of Sheffield, the region has enormous capabilities to drive innovation in clean energy technologies.

As articulated by South Yorkshire Mayor, Oliver Coppard, this is about more than just a national imperative; it's about harnessing a regional ecosystem to drive the UK's broader greener, fairer, more secure vision. The political will is strong, both nationally and locally, and the time for delivery is now.",https://www.amrc.co.uk/files/img_cache/4922/1200_630_1759482647_CESlead.jpg?1759482734,N,,2025-10-03 15:03:20.747775

A new tool from a nonprofit climate coalition spearheaded by former Vice President Al Gore aims to help Louisiana residents see how the invisible threat travels — and who’s most at risk.

Introduced at New York Climate Week in late September, Climate TRACE is a new website that aims to show an inventory of emissions. The tool models the spread of particulate matter, tiny particles that can lead to heart and lung problems as well as premature death when inhaled.

On a given day, the map uses thousands of dots to show how the pollutants disperse into the air from facilities and into nearby communities. The tool also shows how much the same facilities contribute to human-caused climate change, as both the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels.

“The connection between the climate crisis and the public health crisis driven by particulate pollution from the burning of fossil fuels to make petrochemicals, power transportation or generate power has not often received adequate attention,” Gore said in an interview.

Gore teased the release of the tool at an August event in St. James Parish. His group first developed it to depict how pollution travels in Louisiana’s 85-mile-long petrochemical corridor along the Mississippi River, nicknamed “Cancer Alley.” After working with groups in the region, Gore said he was shocked by how severe health problems had become for local residents. Then, his group decided to expand the project.

“When we succeeded in visualizing the particulate pollution in Cancer Alley, it became apparent that this was something we should do all over the country and the world,” Gore said.

He said he hoped the new data and modeling will help community groups make their case to local officials and hold companies accountable.

“There could be some companies that want to swap out their supply chains so that they are not contributing to the disease burden in communities like the River Parishes,” Gore said.

Climate TRACE is already working with some subnational governments, business leaders and other organizations to choose suppliers with lower emissions, Gore said.

The tool itself was developed by Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, combining pollution and weather datasets to model the plumes of particulate matter as the prevailing wind changes. It also uses satellite data and remote sensing to more accurately track greenhouse gas emissions.

Amy Gottsegen with the CREATE lab said Climate TRACE is a much larger, global version of plume modeling her lab creates for the Pittsburgh area each day to help people reduce their exposure to bad air quality.

She noted the tool is limited by the data available. For example, facilities don’t report how much particulate matter they emit each day, so the team uses monthly data to create a daily average.

They’ve also estimated what pollution plumes look like on days with the greatest emissions. The visualization can’t be used to precisely say how much pollution a community is exposed to, but the denser concentrations of particles indicate where more pollution was modeled to be at ground level.

Eventually, Gore hopes this global plume modeling tool — which currently depicts pollution across 9,500 urban areas — will mimic CREATE Lab’s Pittsburgh model, providing new plume modeling as close to real-time as possible. The timeline for such a roll out would likely take years, though, Gore said.

When he announced the tool in St. James, Gore noted that this tool alone won’t help reduce pollution, but communities empowered with information could.

“The information doesn’t do anything by itself unless you turn it into action,” he said. “If you’ve got neighbors and friends to whom you’ve been talking about this, and you have not been able to strike a spark, show them this … Maybe it’ll make it easier to see clearly.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

$7.6 billion

The amount of clean energy project funding canceled by the U.S. Department of Energy this week. The targeted awards were for 223 clean energy projects — all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

$625 million

How much the DOE says it will make available for “beautiful, clean coal.” The funding, cast as an “investment,” is intended to retrofit and recommission coal plants, but the agency has not given details about the structure or source of the money.

$16.6 billion

The increase in revenue driven by data center load from PJM’s last two capacity auctions, according to a Monitoring Analytics, the grid operator’s market monitor. The number accounts for more than half of the total revenue, and the monitor called data centers the “primary reason” for high capacity prices.

40 MW

The decrease in total U.S. coal capacity from January to July, despite modest new additions and delayed retirements, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s latest monthly infrastructure report. Solar continues to account for most of the new generation capacity.

The Three Mile Island nuclear power plant on the outskirts of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is the site of the worst commercial nuclear accident in U.S. history. The 1979 calamity, which released radioactive material into the environment, cast nuclear energy as a dangerous endeavor that few organizations pursued. Now, after years of plants shutting down, nuclear energy is experiencing a renaissance.

Three Mile Island will be restarted in 2027 as the Crane Clean Energy Center, in part to power data centers after a power purchase agreement with Microsoft. Meta also saved a nuclear plant in Illinois that was in danger of closing after signing a 1.1 GW deal. These two major deals signal a growing trend of hyperscalers embracing nuclear power and driving forward expansive new growth.

While nuclear offers stable power with low-carbon emissions, the potential for it to truly reshape the energy market and fulfill the promise of a renaissance requires overcoming complex operational, financial and workforce challenges.

Data centers driving the demand

Recent policy support from the Trump administration has accelerated nuclear development at a new speed, but the increased investment has been on the horizon for years. In 2023, under the Biden administration, the U.S. joined more than 20 other countries in a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to reach climate goals. Countries have been trying to figure out how to feed a surging demand for energy across the world without hurting the environment, and they’ve turned to nuclear power to fulfill that need.

But what’s different about the surge we’re seeing now is the sheer pace at which companies want to get these plants up and running again. They’re trying to keep up with demand to power the data centers needed to support the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. According to Goldman Sachs, AI alone will drive a 165% increase in power demand for data centers in the next five years.

The demand for this power has created a unique dynamic where tech companies are willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrading nuclear facilities that have been offline for years in exchange for long-term power purchase agreements. Unlike traditional utility customers, these companies can sign decades-long contracts that justify the substantial upfront investments required to bring aging nuclear infrastructure back online.

The realities of bringing plants back online

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

There are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States and 18 reactors that are retired or are in the process of retiring. Almost half of the retired/retiring reactors are currently undergoing Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluation to restart. The rest are older and would be too costly to touch. But even so, the ones that could be restarted have been mothballed for years and require hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades and a lengthy project timeline to be powered up again.

Think about any building that has been boarded up for at least five years. No matter the condition, repairs, upgrades, and inspections are needed. That need is exacerbated at a highly specialized and sensitive building like a nuclear power plant. Decommissioned facilities need to restore operating licenses, meet regulatory compliance standards, and fix a major vulnerability: the lack of modern cybersecurity standards.

The environment we’re in now of sophisticated cyber threats is a whole new world compared to when some of these older plants last operated. Cyberattacks on U.S. utilities reportedly jumped 70% last year. Major upgrades need to be put in place so the plants aren’t left vulnerable to bad actors.

Another bottleneck is the supply chain. The capacity to produce uranium rods was scaled back during nuclear’s decline, and rebuilding this manufacturing infrastructure will take time. These are not components that can be quickly sourced from existing inventory; they require specialized facilities and rigorous quality controls.

An equally daunting challenge is human capital. Most experienced nuclear power plant operators retired when facilities shut down over the past decade, taking all of that institutional knowledge with them. Training new operators won’t happen overnight. These are highly specialized positions requiring extensive certification and experience with complex safety protocols. The situation is further complicated by competition from other sectors offering better incentives for nuclear engineers, making it difficult for utilities to attract and retain talent.

Why a broader energy mix still matters

Once the industry gets past these obstacles, even the most optimistic nuclear scenarios cannot eliminate the need for a diverse energy portfolio. Though some natural gas and renewable power projects back off during this time, we’ve also seen continued growth. In Texas, the state’s energy fund just approved its first loan to fund a 122-megawatt natural gas power plant that is projected to begin operations by 2027.

A surge of investment in nuclear power does not mean that it will take over all other resources. Different technologies serve different purposes for grid operations. Nuclear provides excellent baseload power, but grids also need flexible generation that can ramp up and down quickly to match demand fluctuations. Solar and wind, despite their intermittency challenges, remain cost-effective for many applications and will continue to play essential roles in the energy mix.

Even where nuclear development is feasible, the long lead time for a plant to become operational means that other technologies must fill the gap during the years-long transition period. Energy security requires multiple sources operating in concert rather than betting everything on a single technology.

Reshaping the energy market and future financing

Read More in Generation

Data centers have handed nuclear something it’s rarely had: customers willing to pay upfront for guaranteed power over the long haul. Instead of hoping subsidies stick around, companies are putting money behind their need for reliable electricity. It creates a financing model built on genuine market demand. If this proves successful, it could shape the future financing of projects from industries beyond tech companies.

With this demand bolstering the industry, the major concern is that projects to restart nuclear plants will be sped up to keep pace. But they cannot be rushed. Success will require policy support, sustained investment in workforce development, reinforcing the supply chain, and patience to deal with inevitable delays and cost overruns that characterize major infrastructure projects.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIdsAudTEAQ30lovdVYmOOsNwxVlhWu7zfHQLuo6vbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNTY3MTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-03 13:02:30.243510

30%: Americans May Continue Buying EVs: Poll

Analysts have projected that EV sales may decline significantly with the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit. Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has estimated that the EV market will be significantly smaller, possibly accounting for only about 5% of the overall car market, compared to 11% in the third quarter.

But a new Harris Poll published by Automotive News suggests Americans aren’t ready to give up on EVs just yet. The vast majority of the 2,000+ respondents surveyed in late September said they’d still consider an EV—if the price was right.

Here is more from the outlet:

The majority of the EV defectors surveyed—60%—would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider an EV, and nearly 30 percent would reconsider an EV with an incentive ranging from $2,500 to $4,999. Eleven percent would settle for an incentive of less than $2,500.

Incentives are important to EV adoption because affordability remains a top concern among buyers, said Greg Paratore, senior consultant at the Harris Poll. Affordability is the top concern for 64% of EV buyers, according to an August study by the Harris Poll and Urban Science.

Sept. 30 has come and gone, but the discounts still exist. Sales growth may not be as robust as it was before, but if automakers continue to offer technologically superior vehicles at competitive prices, buyers will not run away.

General Motors and Ford have extended the use of the federal tax credit by having their financing arms purchase EVs on dealer lots with initial down payments, which would qualify those models for the tax credit. It’s a creative arrangement that will lower purchase price or monthly lease payments.

The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 5 now gets an average price cut of over $9,000. That means the starting price of the Ioniq 5 is now $35,000 before destination. That’s on par with the Chevy Equinox EV and Toyota bZ, which are both competitive but not as advanced as the Ioniq 5, which gets rides on an 800-volt architecture with some of the fastest-charging speeds in the U.S. Hyundai will also continue offering $7,500 cash incentives on model year 2025 Ioniq 5s, which are on dealer lots through October.

Rivian’s lease deals have not vanished either. The EV start-up is offering a $6,500 rebate on select R1T and R1S models to customers who take delivery of their vehicles before October 31.

Also note that several affordable models are imminent. The all-new Nissan Leaf with over 300 miles of range and a $30,000 starting price is now on sale. The next-generation Chevy Bolt EV is around the corner, and it’s already leaked. Additionally, Tesla has a more affordable Model Y (or whatever it will be called) in the pipeline. The timing is ripe for these affordable EVs, and they might help the industry continue moving forward despite the broad attack on clean energy from the White House.

At the same time, the plan to continue growing the EV market share comes at the expense of automakers' bottom lines more than ever, right when they're getting slammed by tariff costs. That could end up being a toxic cocktail. As before, get the deals while they last.

60%: Some Tesla Investors To Vote Against Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Compensation

Some Tesla inventors aren’t thrilled about the prospect of CEO Elon Musk becoming the world’s first trillionaire. He already became the first half-trillionaire this week. This group comprises the SOC Investment Group and state treasurers from Nevada, New Mexico, and Connecticut.

Here’s more from Reuters:

The group cited what it called the board's ""relentless pursuit"" of retaining Musk, saying it has delayed progress on key goals set at the last annual meeting, and pointed to declining operational and financial performance and a ""failure to provide meaningful real-time oversight of management.""

The news comes as Tesla investors shrugged off record Q3 deliveries of nearly half a million EV sales globally. Tesla’s share price dropped by 3% as of Thursday afternoon, indicating that the company’s market value is closely tied to developments in AI and robotics, rather than vehicle sales.

But its sales declined for the first time in half a decade amid rising competition and government intervention to prevent predatory pricing.

Here’s more from Nikkei:

Since March 2025, year-on-year growth has slowed with each passing month. In August, sales rose just 0.1%, and they fell 6% in September to 396,270 units. Passenger cars, which account for over 90% of sales, were down 6% to 393,060 units.

Rivals Geely, Leapmotor, and Xiaomi have been rapidly growing in China, offering cutting-edge EVs at competitive rates. Additionally, the Chinese government intervened amid the price war, which was hurting smaller suppliers who were receiving delayed payments from car companies, sometimes as long as 200 days in some cases.

A regulatory change in June now forces companies like BYD to pay suppliers within 60 days of component delivery. Now BYD is seeking to make up for the slowdown in China by expanding in Europe, with a new plant under construction in Hungary. And it showcased several new models at the IAA Mobility 2025 motor show in Munich last month.

100%: Which Brand Will Win The Affordable EV Battle?

The $35,000 Chevy Equinox EV shot to the top of GM’s sales charts when it went on sale last year, proving that buyers will jump at an EV with decent range and a reasonable price tag. But the Equinox EV now faces serious competition. Hyundai is rolling out a similarly priced 2026 Ioniq 5. Nissan has opened orders for its new Leaf. And Tesla’s long-rumored affordable Model Y-based crossover is lurking just around the corner.

So who do you think is best positioned to win? Buyers want low prices, but also quick charging stops and the ability to occasionally take long-distance road trips. Will it be Tesla, Hyundai, or GM? Or could Nissan, Ford, or even Toyota stage a surprise comeback?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/4047AJ/s1/cm-nissan-leaf-8-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:08:44.686979

DETROIT – Tesla and General Motors are leading the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles, as consumers hurried to buy EVs before up to $7,500 in federal incentives for each purchase ended in September.

New data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence shows U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids, topped 1 million units through the first nine months of the year and set a new quarterly record of more than 438,000 units sold during the third quarter — achieving market share of 10.5% for the period.

That record market share is up from 7.4% during the second quarter and 7.6% during the first three months of the year, according to Motor Intelligence. Sales of all-electric models were estimated to be 1.3 million in 2024, with a roughly 8% market share.

U.S. EV industry leader Tesla, which does not report sales by region, is estimated to have retained its leadership position with a 43.1% market share through September, according to the data. That's down from 49% to end last year, as competitors continue to release new EVs.

GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September.

The sales data comes two days after GM estimated it leads the U.S. industry in EV market share growth so far in 2025, with the lowest incentives of any major automaker. It sold 144,668 EVs through September, which still only represented 6.8% of its total U.S. sales.

""No one is in a stronger position for a changing U.S. market than GM,"" Duncan Aldred, GM president of North America, said in a release. ""We have the best lineup of ICE [internal combustion engine] and EV vehicles we've ever had. Our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, and low incentives and inventory.""

Following Tesla, GM and Hyundai, Motor Intelligence data shows Ford Motor's EV market share was 6.6% through the third quarter, followed by Volkswagen at 5.4%; Honda Motor at 4.6%; and BMW at 3.6%.

Michael Wayland | CNBC

Despite sales increasing each quarter of this year, EV startups Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group continue to have a relatively small EV market share. Lucid remains under 1%, while Rivian was at 3% through September.

Major automakers reported third-quarter results this week that were led by EV sales. The rush to buy electric cars came ahead of the federal incentives for those vehicles ending as a result of the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Industry analysts and executives believe the incentives ending will create a boom-and-bust cycle for the sale of EVs in the U.S.

Ford CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from an industry market share of around 10% to 12% in September to 5% after the incentive program ends.

The end of EV credits for the U.S. comes as the country continues to trail other major automakers in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. The International Energy Agency reports China continued to lead EV adoption globally last year, with sales of 6.4 million all-electric vehicles, not counting hybrids, followed by Europe at 2.2 million units.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas on Thursday selected a route and authorized Entergy to develop the Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project, or SETEX, which includes a 145-mile, 500-kV transmission line and other associated equipment.

Entergy Texas operates outside of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid that serves most of the Lone Star State. The SETEX project aims to boost reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint.

The PUCT also on Thursday selected six projects to receive about $381 million in support from the Texas Energy Fund’s Outside ERCOT Grant Program. Of the grants, Entergy could receive about $200 million.

Dive Insight:

Texas regulators have approved about $4 billion in Entergy investments in the last month. The utility serves approximately 524,000 customers.

In September, the commission approved a pair of new Entergy gas plants with a $2.4 billion price tag. And the SETEX project will reportedly cost an estimated $1.4 billion.

“Growth in Southeast Texas is creating incredible opportunities for the communities we serve, and it’s our responsibility to ensure we build a resilient power grid that supports long-term economic expansion and future energy needs,” Entergy Texas CEO Eliecer Viamontes said in a statement.

The SETEX project includes two new stations: the Babel Switching Station in Newton County and Running Bear Substation in Montgomery County, the company said. The transmission line will pass through Jasper, Montgomery, Newton, Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, Tyler and Walker counties.

The route approved by regulators at Thursday’s open meeting will cross Lake Livingston, which had been a key point of debate.

MISO identified the SETEX project through its long-range planning process as critical to ensuring compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corp. baseline standards and the provision of reliable and cost-effective service as demand continues to grow, according to Entergy.

The selected route “affects the fewest number of habitable structures, has the lowest estimated cost of the focus routes, and was identified by Entergy as best meeting the criteria the Commission must consider,” PUCT Chairman Thomas Gleeson wrote in a memo ahead of the vote.

The PUCT also tapped six projects outside ERCOT to receive grants from the Texas Energy Fund. While the fund is best known for providing low-cost loans to support gas generation in ERCOT, it has multiple programs and the Outside ERCOT Grant Program provides funding for transmission and distribution infrastructure or electric generating facilities not in the organized Texas market.

The outside-ERCOT program “maybe didn’t get as much attention as the inside-ERCOT piece, but it is just as important,” Gleeson said.

Commissioner Kathleen Jackson noted that the grants are not final, and the PUCT and utilities must still reach execution agreements.

Entergy could receive over half the awards the commission approved yesterday, about $200 million.

“With these funds, the company will implement upgrades and replacements across the electrical system to improve resiliency and reliability — decreasing the number of customers impacted and the duration of outages following extreme events,” the utility said in a statement. Over 9,000 structures and about 400 line-miles of transmission and distribution will be hardened to address risks posed by hurricanes, wildfires and other events.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIURurA3QWk5-xX6PoCE3Dql4ok7oaYV7uX-NKBoaN4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc1BVQ1RBdWd1c3RfTGdUUnZhai5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:13.030109

Just last month, Rep. Gabe Evans (R-Colo.) toured United Power’s Mountain Peak natural gas peaking plant. It’s part of a move away from coal.

“This investment will help provide more reliable, safe, and affordable energy for #CO08,” Evans wrote on social media in September.

The Department of Energy canceled a $6 million grant for the rural electric cooperative Wednesday.

His office, along with numerous other Republican offices contacted for this story, did not respond to requests for comment.

DOE’s termination Wednesday of 321 financial awards worth roughly $7.56 billion was touted by White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as retribution against Democrats for the government shutdown and a chance to dismantle the “Green New Scam” — the Republican pejorative for Democratic legislation passed during the Biden era.

But according to details sent to Congress and compiled by Hill Democrats, the award cancellations include dozens of job-creating projects in congressional districts controlled by Republicans.

“This was obviously designed as a political attack by the White House targeting Democrats. But the sad reality is that Americans — the middle class, working class, and vulnerable — who voted for both Democrats and Republicans will be hurt by this,” said House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.).

Still, at least one Republican said he was OK with the cuts, even if they affected his district. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), a conservative with libertarian sensibilities, shrugged at the loss of three projects in his district totaling $110 million.

“Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money away from families that they have earned,” he said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

The three projects include a glass container plant, an electronics recycling operation and a biofuels power plant.

McClintock went on to cite a free-market French economist from the 1800s, Frédéric Bastiat, as backup for his stance.

“In the 19th Century, Bastiat called this ‘plunder,’ and it still is today,” he added. “I strongly support the DOE decision for all the reasons I outlined in my ‘just say no to subsidies‘ speech last year.”

Previous GOP support

In all, at least 28 GOP lawmakers would see spending tied to their districts canceled, while 108 Democrats’ districts would be hit.

Democrats raged against the cuts Thursday. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) called the administration’s actions “nakedly political, unhinged and unlawful.” He said his state lost $135.2 million in funding, with projects ranging from a carbon storage hub effort to a battery storage system.

The cancellations with the highest dollar amount were related to DOE’s hydrogen hub program, an effort made possible by the bipartisan infrastructure law. It was designed to create a national network of hydrogen fuel producers. DOE canceled funding for both the ARCHES hub in California and another hub in the Pacific Northwest.

The $1 billion Pacific Northwest project was slated to rope in three states: Washington, Oregon and Republican-led Montana. Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had heralded the Pacific Northwest project’s job-creating impact at the time of its announcement in 2023.

“Through its investment in St. Regis, the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub will create more good-paying Montana jobs and ramp up American-made energy in the Treasure State,” Gianforte said.

Four California House Republicans — Reps. Vince Fong, David Valadao, Jay Obernolte and Young Kim — had previously signed a letter urging DOE not to cancel funding for the ARCHES hydrogen hub.

The bipartisan letter sent to Energy Secretary Chris Wright in April asserted the project was a “strategic investment in American energy innovation,” that was part of “an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and energy independence and competitiveness.”

“[W]e respectfully request that you continue supporting ARCHES and provide time for the California hub and its member organizations to further justify their vital role in meeting the energy goals of the administration,” they wrote.

‘What took so long?’

Other projects appear to be targeted at companies in Democratic states but have spill-over impacts in red districts.

For example, Moment Energy, based in Delaware, had a $20 million award canceled for a manufacturing facility creating grid-scale batteries. That factory, however, was slated to be constructed in Texas — specifically in the district of Republican Rep. John Carter — and is expected to create more than 50 manufacturing jobs and 200 permanent positions.

Conservatives have been eager to see the Trump administration slash government funding for clean energy projects across the country. Trump ordered agencies to “terminate the Green New Deal” on his first day back in office.

Many on the right welcomed this week’s news, but at least one had a lingering question.

“What took so long?” asked Tom Pyle, president of the conservative and fossil-fuel-funded Institute for Energy Research.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/39/ef/fb10b8884d3cabf9af73dc9b25c4/u-s-congress-07624.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:17.292443

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

As it turns out, the Fort Wayne data center is not an exception: Approximately 44% of all data centers proposed in Indiana are in counties that have restricted or banned new renewable energy projects.
“The primary challenges are the size of the data center and the amount of space it takes to build renewables,” he said.
“They are moving from 20 megawatt or 40 megawatt data centers to 100, 200, 300 megawatt data centers.
In the end, it really does seem like data centers are being sited in places with renewable energy restrictions.","Data centers are being built in places that restrict renewable energy. There are significant implications for our future energy grid – but it’s unclear if this behavior will lead to tech companies eschewing renewables or finding novel ways to still meet their clean energy commitments.

In the previous edition of The Fight, I began chronicling the data center boom and a nascent backlash to it by talking about Google and what would’ve been its second data center in southern Indianapolis, if the city had not rejected it last Monday. As I learned about Google’s practices in Indiana, I focused on the company’s first project – a $2 billion facility in Fort Wayne, because it is being built in a county where officials have instituted a cumbersome restrictive ordinance on large-scale solar energy. The county commission recently voted to make the ordinance more restrictive, unanimously agreeing to institute a 1,000-foot setback to take effect in early November, pending final approval from the county’s planning commission.

As it turns out, the Fort Wayne data center is not an exception: Approximately 44% of all data centers proposed in Indiana are in counties that have restricted or banned new renewable energy projects. This is according to a review of Heatmap Pro data in which we cross-referenced the county bans and ordinances we track against a list of proposed data centers prepared by an Indiana energy advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana.

This doesn’t necessarily mean the power going to these data centers is consistently fossil. Data centers can take years to construct and often rely on power fed to them from a distributed regional energy grid. But this does mean it would be exceptionally costly for any of these projects to build renewable generation on site, as a rising number of projects choose to do – not to mention that on a macro level, data centers may increasingly run up against the same cultural dynamics that are leading to solar and wind project denials. (See: this local news article about the Fort Wayne data center campus).

Chrissy Moy, a Google spokesperson, told me the Fort Wayne facility will get its power off of the PJM grid, and sent me links to solar projects and hydroelectric facilities in other states on the PJM it has power purchase agreements with. I’d note the company claims it “already matches” all of its global annual electricity demand with “renewable energy purchases.” What this means is that if Google can’t generate renewable energy for a data center directly, it will try to procure renewable energy at the same time from the same grid, even if it can’t literally use that clean power at that data center. And if that's not possible, it will search farther afield or at different times. (Google is one of the more aggressive big tech companies in this regard, as my colleague Emily Pontecorvo details.) Google has also boasted that it will provide an undisclosed amount of excess clean electricity through rights transfers to Indiana Michigan Power when the tech company’s load is low and demand on the broader grid is peaking, as part of Google’s broader commitment to grid flexibility.

I reached out to Tom Wilson, an energy systems technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry-focused organization that studies modern power and works with tech companies on flexible data center energy use, including Google. Wilson told me that in Indiana, many of the siting decisions for data centers were made before counties enacted moratoria against renewable energy and that tech companies may not always be knowingly siting projects in places where significant solar or wind generation would be impractical or even impossible. (We would just note that Fort Wayne, Indiana, has an opposition risk score of 84 in Heatmap Pro, meaning it would have been a very risky place to build a renewable energy project even without that restrictive ordinance.) It also indicates some areas may be laying down renewables restrictions after seeing data center development, which is in line with a potential land use techlash.

Wilson told me that two thirds of data centers rely on power from the existing energy grid whereas surveys indicate about a third choose to have at least some electricity generation on site. In at least the latter case, land use constraints and permitting problems really can be a hurdle for building renewable energy close to where data is processed. This is a problem exacerbated when centers are developed near population centers, which Wilson said is frequently the case because companies want to reduce “latency” for customers. In other words, they want to “reduce the time it takes to get answers to people” via artificial intelligence or other data products.

“The primary challenges are the size of the data center and the amount of space it takes to build renewables,” he said. “They are moving from 20 megawatt or 40 megawatt data centers to 100, 200, 300 megawatt data centers. It’s really hard to locate that much renewable [energy] right near a population center. So that requires transmission, and unfortunately right now in the U.S. and in many other countries, transmission takes a significant amount of time to build.”

The majority of data centers are served by regional power grids, Wilson told me. Companies like Google, Meta, and others continue to invest in renewable energy procurement while building facilities in areas that have restricted new solar or wind power infrastructure. In some cases, companies may feel they’re forced to seek these places out because the land is just plain cheap and has existing fiber optic cable networks.

At the same time, there are large data centers getting energy generated on site, and how they each approach their energy sources varies. It’s also not always consistent.

For instance, Meta’s new Prometheus supercluster complex in New Albany, Ohio — potentially the world’s first 1 gigawatt data center — will reportedly have a significant amount of new gas power generation constructed at the facility, even though the company also struck a deal with Invenergy over the summer to procure at least 400 megawatts of solar from two projects in Ohio that already have their permits. One is in Clinton County and was fully permitted but resulted in a years-long fight before the Ohio Power Siting Board and included conservative media backlash. The other is in Franklin County and got its permits in 2021, before a recent wave of opposition against solar projects. Prometheus itself will be sited on the Licking County side of New Albany, where solar has been extremely difficult to build, even though most of this Columbus suburb is in solar-supporting Franklin.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI data center notoriously relies on a polluting gas plant in Memphis, Tennessee. The surrounding Shelby County had a solar moratorium until mere months ago that residents want to bring back. An affiliate company of xAI used for the project’s real estate is subleasing land near the data center for a solar farm, but it is unclear right now if it’ll power the data center.

In the end, it really does seem like data centers are being sited in places with renewable energy restrictions. What the data center developers plan to do about it — if anything — is still an open question.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY3MDUwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzM0OTIwNH0.R2bL8NHbYY3cBJ872x8jlNQIb-iWXY9o7upuQnet07U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:39.262211

Case Study: Panasonic’s $4 Billion EV Battery Factory in Kansas

As the global electric vehicle (EV) battery market is projected to soar to USD 661.98 billion by 2034, North America is emerging as one of the fastest-growing regions, driven by strong government incentives, domestic manufacturing initiatives, and rising EV adoption. A key milestone in this trajectory is Panasonic Energy’s decision to invest heavily in the U.S. to localize EV battery production.

The Challenge

Historically, the U.S. has relied heavily on imported EV batteries, leaving the domestic market vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and cost fluctuations. With increasing EV demand and stringent policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, there was mounting pressure on manufacturers to scale production locally, reduce dependency on Asia, and create a sustainable supply chain for battery manufacturing.

The Initiative

In July 2025, Panasonic officially opened its $4 billion EV battery factory in De Soto, Kansas, spanning 4.7 million sq ft (roughly 225 football fields).

The facility started mass production of 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion cells for EVs.

It aims for an annual production capacity of 32 GWh once fully operational.

The factory is expected to generate thousands of local jobs, boosting regional economic development.

This move directly supports automakers in meeting growing EV demand and aligns with U.S. policies encouraging domestic EV battery production.

Outcomes

Supply Chain Strengthening: By producing batteries domestically, the U.S. reduces reliance on imports from Asia, creating a more resilient supply chain.

Cost Competitiveness: Localized production helps lower logistics costs and mitigates tariff impacts, making EVs more affordable.

Job Creation: Thousands of new positions are being created in Kansas, contributing to regional economic development.

Industry Signal: Panasonic’s investment validates North America’s potential as a leading EV battery hub, encouraging similar moves by other global players.

Key Takeaways

The case highlights how large-scale private investments, backed by favorable government policy, accelerate market growth.

It demonstrates the real-world link between projected market expansion (as in your PR) and on-the-ground execution.

It underscores the U.S.’s strategy to lead in clean energy technologies by building localized, sustainable, and future-ready EV battery infrastructure.

The U.S. is a major player in the regional market, due to a combination of strong government support, substantial investments in domestic manufacturing, and technological innovation. Policies like the Inflation Reduction Act have funneled billions into EV production and battery development, incentivizing companies to build large-scale battery plants within the country. Major automakers and battery manufacturers are forming strategic partnerships to boost production capacity and advance battery technology, focusing on improving energy density, reducing costs, and increasing sustainability. Additionally, expanding EV charging infrastructure is accelerating EV adoption, further driving demand for locally produced batteries.

GM’s Q3 EV sales record of 66,501 units helped boost the automaker’s quarterly sales 8% YoY.
US EV market leader Tesla reported 7% growth in quarterly deliveries.
The brand’s EV sales grew 100% while hybrids were up 48%.
Kondrat offered a counterpoint to the gloom, pointing to California’s EV market maintaining stable sales rates after doing away with state incentives.","Time’s up.

A federal tax incentive that offered up to $7,500 off the price of EVs is officially dead thanks to President Trump’s tax and budget bill, a development that has prompted predictions of cratering demand from US auto executives.

“It’s a game-changer,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said at an event in Detroit this week. “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5% of our industry, from, probably, this month, 10% [or] 12%.”

Smashing records: With the clock ticking down to the Sept. 30 expiration date, Q3 saw a surge in EV demand. Cox Automotive forecast a record 410,000 sales, up 21.1% YoY and 30% over Q2. The EV boom lifted the entire new-vehicle market in Q3, according to industry analysts.

“The biggest driver of September’s strong sales pace is temporarily inflated demand for electric vehicles,” Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at JD Power, said in a statement. The firm’s data showed EVs reaching 12.2% market share in September, up 2.6 percentage points from a year ago, translating to a 27.5% increase in EV sales.

GM’s Q3 EV sales record of 66,501 units helped boost the automaker’s quarterly sales 8% YoY. “No one is in a stronger position for a changing US market than GM,” Duncan Aldred, GM senior VP and president of North America, said in a statement.

Ford’s 8.2% YoY sales gain got a lift from the automaker’s record electrified vehicle sales. Ford reported new sales records for both hybrids and battery-electric vehicles, with BEVs up 30.2%.

US EV market leader Tesla reported 7% growth in quarterly deliveries.

Hyundai had its best-ever Q3, with sales up 13% YoY. The brand’s EV sales grew 100% while hybrids were up 48%.

Sister brand Kia also reported a record quarterly performance, and said that its electrified vehicle sales grew 26% through September.

American Honda’s sales fell 2% YoY in Q3, but the automaker said that “record sales of electrified models” helped it navigate “challenging market conditions.”

Toyota reported a nearly 16% YoY sales gain and a 10.5% leap in electrified vehicle sales.

BEVs even outsold the popular hybrid segment in September, Tom Kondrat, global lead of advanced analytics for Urban Science, told Tech Brew.

Extended savings: Numerous automakers have made moves to extend EV deals past the credits’ expiration date.

GM and Ford introduced programs to effectively extend the $7,500 credit on EV leases, Reuters reported this week. And Hyundai announced Wednesday that it’s slashing prices across its 2026 Ioniq 6 lineup by up to $9,800, and maintaining $7,500 cash incentives for 2025 model year EVs.

“While the $7,500 EV credit has expired, our electrification strategy has always extended beyond incentives,” Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, said in a statement. “We invested in EV innovation well before the [Inflation Reduction Act] and remain steadfast in our commitment to affordability, quality, and customer care.”

Tackling affordability challenges will be key to maintaining momentum in the EV market, according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights.

“With $7,500 incentives eliminated, the case for EVs now rests on performance, technology, and total cost of ownership, rather than subsidies,” she wrote.

Kondrat offered a counterpoint to the gloom, pointing to California’s EV market maintaining stable sales rates after doing away with state incentives.

“There’s too much infrastructure that’s been invested. There’s too much production capacity,” he said. “I think the market will align. Automakers will find ways to make them more affordable, ways to make them more attractive, and we will see a continued trend upward.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/302eb655dc2823dcbda6752fdd2a6a78145d8026-700x467.gif?rect=0,49,700,368&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-10-03 10:59:46.879678

The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.
Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse.
So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.” But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.","A dozen federal grants that support energy projects in Connecticut are on the chopping block as the Trump administration cuts more funding in the early days of a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump has warned that his administration could wield executive power to make a shutdown painful for Democrats and “[cut] things that they like.” And he’s appearing to quickly follow through on that threat in mostly blue states — and Connecticut is among the targets.

The U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday it’s terminating nearly $8 billion that supports hundreds of clean energy and other climate-related projects across 16 states, including Connecticut. After reviewing all financial awards, the agency decided they “did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.”

The Department of Energy has yet to publicly provide a state breakdown of each affected project, and it didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the specific funding cuts in Connecticut.

The Energy Department did provide information to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s office on Thursday, but the Connecticut Democrat is still trying to track down the exact projects and funding amounts that will now dry up.

“I am demanding more information and specifics into this threatened cut for climate change projects, which are essential for Connecticut,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “We will not be bullied by this destructive and illegal withholding of critical support.”

The funding awarded to Connecticut came from two offices at DOE: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy. Between the eight recipients, they were expected to receive nearly $53 million for various projects, according to House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro.

RTX Corporation, Mott Corporation, Proton Energy Systems Inc., Linde Inc., Calcify Inc., Karpman Consulting LLC, the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy were awarded contracts. But the exact amount each will lose is unclear because some projects have been in the works for years and already received parts of the funding.

Some of the projects include funding for a Carbon Capture Machine, the development of a hydrogen refueling station for heavy-duty trucks, and the design of “coated titanium porous transport layers (PTLs) used for water electrolysis.”

At least one recipient doesn’t expect the termination to have much of an effect.

FuelCell Energy, which is headquartered in Danbury, has been working on performance improvements for fuel cell systems for several years. And because that effort has wrapped up, the company anticipates receiving the rest of the money from DOE, which it has worked with since the 1970s on various research projects.

“This particular project has been underway for nearly five years and is now at its conclusion. We have already received the majority of the contract compensation and expect the small remaining balance to be honored, as the work has been fully completed,” FuelCell Energy spokesperson Kathleen Blomquist said in a statement.

The initial news of cuts a day earlier sparked a wave of confusion since there was little information. The state’s congressional delegation was frustrated that the White House would try to “bully” them during the ongoing funding standoff.

About a quarter of the projects under fire were awarded during the final months of the Biden administration, following the November elections, according to DOE. Others date back from years earlier. The Energy Department said the award recipients have 30 days to file an appeal.

Hours into the shutdown, White House Budget Director Russ Vought started posting on social media the various projects and funding that would go away. He first posted that New York City would lose about $18 billion in infrastructure projects, specifically naming the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue subway.

A few hours later, he announced the $8 billion in climate funding cuts. Every state target by those cuts voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, and almost all are led by Democratic governors. They are also represented by Democratic U.S. senators who opposed the GOP funding bill.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Today’s cancellation’s delivers on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

Connecticut officials and lawmakers have received little, if any, information from federal agencies.

James Fowler, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said earlier Thursday that the agency has not received any notice from federal authorities about which projects will be affected by the decision.

“We’re working with what resources we have to figure [it] out,” he said.

Funding awarded to utilities in Connecticut appear unscathed. A spokesperson for Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating, confirmed that none of its projects have been affected by the cuts.

While the loss of funding will have real-life consequences in Connecticut, the underlying motives feel political to Democrats. Connecticut’s congressional delegation argues the administration is holding up Democratic priorities like clean energy as “partisan extortion.”

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment and eliminate jobs,” DeLauro said. “It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust.”

U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, also raised concerns about the potential for layoffs and higher energy costs.

“Connecticut residents are already dealing with the rising cost of living and cannot afford increasing energy bills,” Hayes said in a statement.

Since taking office, Trump has made federal funding cuts a centerpiece of his second administration, saying he wants to cut waste, fraud and abuse. But some of the initial cuts led to confusion and chaos earlier this year when he temporarily paused all federal grants. The administration has lifted freezes on certain funds.

But the issue has again gripped Washington, and the finger-pointing over the shutdown has only intensified in recent days.

The parties couldn’t agree to a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that would keep government agencies running at current levels.

“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said Tuesday. “And you know all you all know Russell Vought. He’s become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown.”

But the latest maneuver could have the opposite effect as Democrats dig in further over the energy funding cuts.

“Just naked and brazen corruption,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law.”

To learn more, my co-host Tim Levin and I spoke to Elaine Buckberg, who is a Senior Fellow at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. She's also the former Chief Economist of General Motors and a former senior U.S. Treasury official, so she's well-versed in the entire EV tax credit system, why it happened, where it was successful—and where it fell short.

One thing she cited as a miss for the credit: the leasing loophole, which was primarily designed to get corporate fleets into EVs but ultimately led more than 1 million people (including me, for transparency's sake) to net super-cheap lease deals. Why was that a bad thing?

""It undermined EV purchasing,"" Buckberg told us. ""Put income caps, put price caps on the tax credit instead. Why should we subsidize someone who's going to make the purchase anyway? We're trying to catalyze marginal purchases. If you ask me what to do to make the policy cheaper, I would have closed the lease loophole and not eliminated the credit.""

As reported this week by Energy-Storage.news Premium, Investor-owned utility Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) is requesting authorisation from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) to develop a new portfolio of eight self-build energy projects.

The portfolio features two BESS projects with a combined capacity of 472MW/1.88GWh, one in New Mexico and one in Texas, along with new solar, wind, and fossil gas facilities. SPS is pursuing expedited regulatory approval for these new assets to address what it describes as a “significant capacity deficit.”

In March, EPE and EDF also announced operations of the 10MW Chihuahuan Desert solar facility in San Elizario, Texas, as part of the Texas Community Solar programme.

In August, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) acquired full ownership of EDF’s 1GWh Beehive BESS in Arizona. That project also has a 20-year tolling agreement with Arizona utility Arizona Public Service Company.

Enlight secures US$340 million for 940MWh Arizona project

Also happening in Arizona, IPP Enlight Renewable Energy has closed two tax equity partnerships totalling nearly US$340 million for its 290MWdc/940MWh solar-plus-storage Roadrunner project.

The agreements were closed through Enlight’s US subsidiary Clēnera Holdings.

The initial agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank concerns the project’s 290MW solar component. It features a tax equity contribution at the commercial operation date (COD) and additional pay-go payments during the first 10 years of operation.

The second agreement with M&T Bank and First Citizens Bank offers tax equity financing for the 940 MWh storage component at COD.

Together, the two partnerships account for about US$340 million in tax equity commitments at COD, with expectations to rise to nearly US$390 million when pay-go contributions are included.

In December 2024, ESN reported on Enlight’s announced financing for Roadrunner, which totalled US$550 million.

That financing was split between a US$290 million term loan and US$320 million of tax equity funding on the project’s commercial operation date (COD).

A representative for Enlight confirmed with ESN that the US$320 million tax equity funding has increased to US$340 million.

All procurement contracts for Roadrunner are signed. The project has a 20-year busbar PPA with utility Arizona Electric Power Cooperative (AEPCO).

Roadrunner now involves a total investment of US$621 million. Enlight says the solar generation component has initiated production of test energy, and the project is expected to achieve full commercial operation by the end of 2025.

Once fully operational, it is expected to generate annual revenues exceeding US$50 million in its first full year of operation and EBITDA of approximately US$40 million.

The company also anticipates that the solar component will benefit from Production Tax Credits (PTC), while the storage component is expected to receive Investment Tax Credits (ITC). Additionally, the project is projected to qualify for the 10% Energy Community Adder.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Milagro.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:11:22.472297

The U.S. Department of Energy broke the law last month when officials attempted to cap the amount of federal funding states could receive to cover the staff and administrative costs of sustainable energy and energy efficiency projects, a federal judge found.

Federal Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other Democratic attorneys general who sued the U.S. Department of Energy and its leader, Chris Wright, in August over attempts to cut funding for such projects. Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal energy department.

Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench and no written order has yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new federal energy department rule mandating that “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — cannot exceed 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations. Officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Rayfield was joined in the latest suit by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/SolarInstallJBHouse1-2048x1536-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 11:00:29.792110

""When North Carolina’s GOP-led legislature nixed a key decarbonization deadline for Duke Energy in July, critics feared it would upend the state’s transition to clean energy.

Now, a proposal Duke just submitted to regulators shows they were right to worry as the utility, North Carolina’s largest, seeks to walk back its clean-energy ambitions and enact one of the most aggressive fossil-fuel expansions in the nation.

Without a mandate to cut climate-warming emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, the utility intends to build about half as much wind and solar capacity over the next decade compared to its previous trajectory. It also now aims to delay the construction of new nuclear power plants until later in the 2030s. Battery storage is the sole bright spot for clean energy in the blueprint — Duke wants to invest in about 1.5 gigawatts more than it did before.

Meanwhile, the company proposes to extend the life of aging coal plants and develop more natural-gas units, bringing its total build-out of new fossil-fuel plants to 9.7 gigawatts by 2035 and as much as 12.3 gigawatts by 2040.""",https://www.sej.org/sites/default/files/default_images/logo200x200_3.png,N,,2025-10-03 13:03:06.574941

The Port Authority is also studying whether hydrogen power could play a role in the transition.
Port Authority engages the next generation Mitchell also sees education as key to building a more sustainable maritime sector.
Through a partnership with the Detroit River Story Lab, the Port Authority co-hosts an annual career expo that introduces students to jobs in shipping and logistics.
“The Detroit River has always been a place for family,” she said.","This story was produced in collaboration with the Detroit River Story Lab, a University of Michigan initiative that supports local efforts to center the river as a site of connection and belonging. The Lab’s local journalism portfolio includes the Detroit River Stories podcast series, the 100 Years Ago Today blog, and the Detroit River Beat, a collection of student-authored stories about the river’s role in sustaining human and more-than-human communities throughout the region.

Taylor Mitchell grew up asking whether the fish and birds in the Detroit River were safe. As a child, she spent time on Belle Isle with her family and wondered what pollution meant for the wildlife she saw around her.

Now, as the Detroit Wayne County Port Authority’s first sustainability manager, Mitchell is leading efforts to cut diesel emissions from port operations that have long polluted neighborhoods like Delray.

Mitchell oversees the Authority’s Decarbonization and Air Quality Improvement Plan, which sets a goal of bringing 23 private terminals along the Detroit and Rouge rivers to net zero emissions by 2040. Much of that work focuses on reducing carbon emissions from diesel-powered trucks, ships, cranes, and other equipment used to move freight.

“I’m trying to be the voice of sustainability in a space that may not be ready to transition,” Mitchell said. “But I’m hoping others can see the benefit of this work, and that our government can contribute to the shift toward sustainable practices.”

From Detroit roots to career in sustainability

Mitchell’s path to this role reflects both local roots and national experience. She graduated from Grosse Pointe North High School before attending North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically Black college, where she studied environmental science.

Mitchell later earned a master’s degree in sustainable systems at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability.

Leaving Detroit for college gave Mitchell perspective, but coming back gave her purpose, she said.

“I love Detroit and was able to grow a lot here and develop the foundation for who I am, but leaving the state and attending an HBCU was pivotal,” she said. “I was able to really grow and develop as a scientist and a leader.”

Mitchell returned to her home state, where she attended University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability to obtain her master’s degree with a focus on sustainable systems.

In graduate school, Mitchell said she immersed herself in big-picture ideas about climate solutions.

“As a student, you get to dream big about how you are going to fix these issues and envision the impact you’re going to have,” she said. Now, working in government, she sees the real-life obstacles — funding, politics, and limited resources.

“I am trying to be the voice of sustainability in a space that may not be ready to transition,” she said. “But I am hoping that others can see the benefit of this work and also that our government can contribute to the assistance of transitioning over to sustainable practices.”

Port Authority builds momentum with federal funds

Mitchell’s position comes at a pivotal moment for the Port Authority, which recently received $24.9 million from the EPA’s Clean Ports Program. The funding will cover the cost of electric forklifts, gantry cranes, and other low-emission equipment at private terminals. It marks the authority’s first significant push to decarbonize freight operations in the Detroit region.

The Port Authority is also studying whether hydrogen power could play a role in the transition. Officials are exploring how hydrogen could be used in a maritime setting and what role Detroit might play in a broader statewide move toward hydrogen fuel.

To keep momentum, Mitchell helped form a Low Carbon Port Committee, where terminal operators share sustainability goals and discuss ways the authority can support them. “Some of the private companies we work with have been super engaged and very excited about this work,” she said.

While collaboration with private companies is key, Mitchell said much of her role also involves making complex sustainability issues understandable to a wide range of audiences.

“I won’t assume that even the government official or private terminal owner understands all of these concepts,” she explains, “but taking the pressure away and focusing on potential impacts keeps people engaged and interested in what it means to live in a clean, green world.”

Mitchell’s personal connection to portside pollution

For Mitchell, the work is more than technical. She has family ties to Delray, one of Detroit’s most heavily polluted neighborhoods, located next to the port and I-75.

“If we aren’t thinking about the people impacted by the port’s pollution, then what are we doing this for?” she said.

Studies have shown that residents of port-adjacent communities face higher risks of asthma and other health problems due to diesel exhaust and industrial emissions. Environmental health advocates have long pressed government agencies and industry leaders to do more.

Mitchell said that perspective shapes how she approaches her work. “Community members know air quality. They’ve lived through it for a long time. They know more about the day-to-day experience than I do. My role is to come into the room as both a teacher and a student.”

Equity, accountability on the river

Mitchell prioritizes open communication between the Port Authority and surrounding neighborhoods. She said she often slows down technical discussions to keep them accessible for residents and decision-makers alike.

“I won’t assume that even a government official or private terminal owner understands all of these concepts,” she said. “Taking the pressure away and focusing on potential impacts keeps people engaged.”

She said some of her most rewarding experiences have been meeting with residents who express cautious optimism about pollution-mitigation projects. “Knowing how this community has been historically impacted by industry and being able to engage with them is my favorite part of this job,” she said.

Port Authority engages the next generation

Mitchell also sees education as key to building a more sustainable maritime sector. Through a partnership with the Detroit River Story Lab, the Port Authority co-hosts an annual career expo that introduces students to jobs in shipping and logistics.

“People just don’t know about the maritime industry and the opportunities that exist — like working on a laker vessel and traveling the Great Lakes,” she said.

Other public events highlight the Detroit River’s role in the region’s history and economy. “Many people who live right along the river may not know the impact it has had on our state and country,” Mitchell said. “Learning that history builds pride and a stronger sense of connection.”

For her, that connection is personal. “The Detroit River has always been a place for family,” she said. “Just looking at the river and being there made us feel connected to it and to each other.”

The audit pointed to ""the potential for favoritism and misuse of public funds"" — but also detailed reforms already taking place.

The forensic audit, conducted by FTI Consulting, was prompted by a series of internal investigations conducted by the Braun administration and a report from the Hannah News Service published in April — it detailed allegations of ethics violations and self-dealing by staffers employed by IEDC-affiliated organizations, including Elevate Ventures.

The 127-page forensic audit detailed no criminal allegations. And it called the ongoing reform efforts a ""positive step towards enhancing transparency and accountability.""

Indiana Economic Development Corporation

The audit highlighted specific issues in the IEDC's policies on confidentiality and conflicts of interest, as well as transparency and accountability for the management of state funds by IEDC-affiliated organizations.

When FTI Consulting cross-checked conflict-of-interest forms with employment history, it found at least 10 instances that went unreported. The audit also found 30 entities that received IEDC funding and were connected to an IEDC board member or employee. Only one was reported to the Indiana State Ethics Commission.

One example of a potential conflict of interest involved the IEDC's former chief innovation officer. Dave Roberts left to become CEO of the Applied Research Institute in 2022. Upon his departure, the audit said Roberts did not obtain a post-employment waiver from the state ethics commission.

The audit said more than 80 percent of Roberts's salary was related to an IEDC contract and indicates a ""potential violation of post-employment restrictions."" Roberts was replaced as CEO during the review.

FTI Consulting also found the IEDC ""does not consistently apply due diligence procedures or competitive bidding processes to assess third-party vendors prior to contracting."" It highlighted Pure Development's selection for the state's controversial LEAP district.

Indiana Economic Development Foundation

The audit also found a ""symbiotic relationship"" between the IEDC and donors to its nonprofit arm, the Indiana Economic Development Foundation. Of the foundation's 107 donors during the review period, 46 received payments or tax credits from the IEDC.

The audit found that IEDC staff had a waiver process ""to ensure there is no quid pro quo"" — but was provided no documentation of that process during the audit.

The audit also highlighted travel expenses it calls ""excessive in nature."" All travel for the foundation and the IEDC were paid by the foundation and reimbursed by the IEDC. During the review period, that totaled more than $13.4 million.

The foundation paid more than $86,000 for international car race tickets and events. An IEDC trip to the COP27 conference in Egypt in 2022 budgeted $90,000 in airfare costs. The audit reported ""the credit card expenses suggest actual airfare costs incurred for the trip were at least $200,000.""

Elevate Ventures

When announcing the forensic audit, Gov. Mike Braun also announced funds allocated to Elevate Ventures would be frozen ""until further evaluation.""

The audit said ""the IEDC's limited communication with and governance of EV, along with a lack of transparency into EV investment level details, contributed to an environment that increased the risk that state and federal funds were being used in a manner that was inconsistent with their stated purpose.""

It also said Elevate Ventures had ""already taken significant steps"" to address the issues identified in the audit, including a comprehensive investment return reconciliation project for the state's 21 Fund. The fund was created by the Indiana legislature in 1999 to ""stimulate the transfer of research and technology into marketable products, diversify Indiana's economy by focusing investment in high technology industry clusters, and encourage an environment of innovation and cooperation among universities and businesses.""",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_pHof4a4l.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:23.241737

Critical minerals are characterised as materials which have economic and strategic significance to a particular country.
There is no universal definition for critical minerals.
Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies.
In 2023, India joined the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a group committed to building a secure supply chain for critical minerals.","The transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) is considered to be one of the most fundamental transformations the automotive industry has faced in decades. The EVs are seen as a key technological innovation for reducing CO2 emissions related to the transport sector. The transport sector accounts for about 23 percent of global life-cycle CO₂ emissions (8.8 Gt), with road transport making up the largest portion (6.5 Gt). Electric vehicles are considered to be a crucial technology that would help in the abatement of carbon emissions. They are considered to be cleaner than ICE vehicles over their lifetime. Several countries have announced targets to phase out ICE vehicles by the year 2050. Considerable literature exists on how various countries have promoted the use of electric vehicles. Norway is one country that has achieved a high level of EV penetration.

A major consequence of the current energy transition is the increasing competition over critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. Critical minerals are the foundational inputs driving the clean energy transition. “Critical materials” is a broad term which is used to refer to those minerals which have no viable substitutes, and the importing countries are open to supply chain risks as the supply is dominated by one or a few countries. Critical minerals are characterised as materials which have economic and strategic significance to a particular country. They are typically linked with a low degree of substitutability, high supply risk and their production is concentrated in a few countries. There is no universal definition for critical minerals.

Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies. Industries like automobile, electronics, manufacturing, defence, and aerospace today depend significantly on these minerals.

Minerals are formed as part of the process of long geological events, spanning over millions of years and are hence a finite resource. Critical minerals have become extremely crucial for new emerging technologies. Industries like automobile, electronics, manufacturing, defence, and aerospace today depend significantly on these minerals. A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that to achieve the net-zero emission targets globally by 2050, the mineral requirement would be almost six times the current inputs. A major portion of mineral reserves exists in developing countries. Recently, the geopolitical supply risks of these critical minerals have increased. The cobalt supply disruption in the 1970s due to political upheaval in DRC and Chinese export curbs on Rare Earth Elements (REEs) in 2010-11 are a few examples of supply risks. After the Chinese disruption in 2010, as a response, governments looked for other suppliers. As a result, the Chinese share of REEs production dropped from 97 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2014.

The Chinese have been accused of rent-seeking behaviour. The “ minerals for infrastructure” deal between the Chinese government and the government of the DRC is cited as an example of this behaviour. Chinese state banks provided loans to DRC for infrastructure in exchange for developmental rights of copper and cobalt mines. The Chinese have been able to increase their share in the global supply of critical minerals due to cheap labour, less stringent environmental regulations, and cheaper extraction of metals.The extent of Chinese dominance can be gauged from the fact that China processes 68 percent of global nickel, 40 percent of copper, 59 percent of lithium, and 73 percent of cobalt. Notably, in 2023, nearly 60 percent of global EV sales were in China, with the EU and the US following with 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

The extent of Chinese dominance can be gauged from the fact that China processes 68 percent of global nickel, 40 percent of copper, 59 percent of lithium, and 73 percent of cobalt.

The structure of the Chinese economy and the scale of its processing sector make China a low-cost supplier of processed minerals. As per the USGS report of 2022, 85 percent of rare earth and around 60 to 70 percent of lithium and cobalt are refined by China. This prolonged experience has provided China with significant advantages in processing these minerals. Since 2020, the EU and the US have looked to counter the offshoring of minerals with policies aimed at strengthening domestic jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act in the US highlights clean energy and infrastructure development. The EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan frames itself as a growth strategy.

India’s Challenge and Opportunity

The Government of India has a target of achieving a share of electric vehicle sales of “30 per cent in private cars, 70 per cent in commercial vehicles, 40 per cent in buses, and 80 per cent in two-wheelers and three-wheelers by 2030”. India is actively engaging in international partnerships, such as the Quad, to frame rules and norms for clean energy supply chains. It has been in talks with countries like Australia, which are rich in critical mineral resources. In 2023, India joined the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a group committed to building a secure supply chain for critical minerals.

However, India needs to enhance exploration within its territory and upgrade existing technology to explore subsurface deposits. India spends a negligible amount compared to China, the US and several others. While using EVs may contribute to lower emissions, when taking into account the manufacturing of EVs, emissions could be much higher than those of conventional ICE vehicles. A study found that emissions from electric vehicle manufacturing during the battery manufacturing phase negate any reduction achieved by EVs, unless the source of electricity generation is shifted from coal to renewable energy sources. A typical EV requires six times the mineral inputs when compared to a conventional car. Hybrid vehicles offer a medium-term alternative during the transition to electric vehicles.

A study found that emissions from electric vehicle manufacturing during the battery manufacturing phase negate any reduction achieved by EVs, unless the source of electricity generation is shifted from coal to renewable energy sources.

For India, securing reliable and affordable access to these minerals is not just a matter of industrial policy but also that of energy security. The global value chains remain heavily concentrated and are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. India should enhance South-South cooperation, as it is the only developing country present in forums like MSP. It is imperative that India speaks for the Global South and ensures access and affordability of critical minerals, resists exploitative and extractivist market practices, and promotes stability and predictability in global supply chains. A coherent policy approach must focus on three themes: diversifying imports through strategic alliances, investing in domestic exploration and processing, and blending renewable energy into the EV value chain. Electric Vehicles are going to alter the geopolitics of the world.

What Is American Resources' Investment Narrative?

For those considering American Resources as an investment, the big picture is all about whether you buy into the company’s long-term ambition to scale up refining and recycling capabilities in the U.S. critical materials supply chain. The recent expansion of the Marion, Indiana Supersite and the long-term partnership between ReElement Technologies and POSCO International America Corp signal tangible progress toward greater operational scale, which could change how short-term catalysts are viewed, particularly in terms of commercialization milestones and customer adoption. Historically, the company has faced financial hurdles, ongoing losses, and compliance challenges, including SEC filing delays and Nasdaq notifications. While these recent moves add commercial momentum and may ease some near-term risks around revenue generation, they do not eliminate the material concerns around profitability, negative equity, and cash runway. Investors need to weigh whether these catalysts now meaningfully offset the risks that have pressured shares, especially given the company’s history of volatility and funding uncertainties.

But despite these growth signals, lingering compliance and financial risks remain front of mind for investors. indicates American Resources may be overvalued.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Among the five community fair value estimates submitted to the Simply Wall St Community, projections span from as little as US$0.0035 to over US$41,800, illustrating just how wide investor opinions can be. With such divergent perspectives, the latest Supersite expansion and partnership may drive future debate, especially as concerns over ongoing losses and the need for reliable financial reporting sit in the background.

According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, about half of all states are pursuing some sort of net zero or “clean” energy goal, mostly in the Northeast or on the West Coast.
Perhaps if they are to prosper, they need not only an American style of energy policy.","Why does the US manage to produce cheaper energy? It’s not as though the laws of physics are any different on the other side of the Atlantic. Nor has there been any shortage of US leaders determined to adopt the kind of renewable energy targets that have done so much to disrupt UK energy markets.

Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission set national standards, while Congress has passed a series of laws to determine the overall national approach. Joe Biden’s dubiously-labelled Inflation Reduction Act unleashed vast amounts of federal subsidies to incentivise “clean” energy production.

But states retain significant control over their own energy mix and there is no single “net zero” law that must be followed across the nation. This has allowed, in the words of Louis Brandeis, a Supreme Court justice in the early 20th century, the US states to act as laboratories, trying out different approaches. It has also meant that the US has not followed Europe and the UK, locking itself into a single, economically calamitous energy policy.

According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, about half of all states are pursuing some sort of net zero or “clean” energy goal, mostly in the Northeast or on the West Coast. The other half, especially some Southern states but also the likes of Pennsylvania, have chosen a different approach, tending to prioritise energy production over emissions reductions.

The effects of this difference in approach are stark. Many of the states that are committed to phasing out oil, gas and coal are discovering that the so-called energy “transition” is not as easy as it’s been made out. Like Britain, some have ended up having to rely on imports to fulfil their energy needs. They are not importing energy from hostile foreign states, however. They are getting it from the likes of Pennsylvania, which was by far the top exporter of electricity to other states in 2023.

Differences in policy have, unsurprisingly, begun to show up in prices. According to official figures, in July, the average price of electricity for households was 26.18 cents per kilowatt hour (KWh) in New York (which is rushing to approve new renewable projects), 30.07c per KWh in Massachusetts (a net zero by 2050 state) and 32.58c per KWh in California (one of the nation’s so-called leaders in green policy). It was only 19.52c per KWh in Pennsylvania (rich in natural gas), 15.12c in Florida (which has been repealing renewable goals), and 13.46c in my home state of Mississippi (which is prioritising overall energy security to drive growth).

This cannot help but to influence decisions on where people want to live and where corporations want to do business. Yes, parts of the United States have suffered from deindustrialisation. But those jobs and factories have not necessarily moved to Mexico or China. Many have shifted South. In July, average industrial electricity prices were 18.06c per KWh in New England, but only 6.60c per KWh in Texas and 7.47c in Mississippi.

It is not just traditional heavy industry that stands to lose when energy costs are inflated in the pursuit of emissions targets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extremely energy-intensive, and it is hard to see how places without affordable energy will be able to build the AI infrastructure needed to remain competitive. In the US, Arizona has emerged as a leading location for data centres, and for good reason. Even the Left-wing media admits that the industry is booming in the state thanks to lower energy costs.

This doesn’t mean that renewables are entirely inappropriate forms of energy everywhere. A state like Texas, for example, has become among the nation’s leading producers of solar and wind, although questions remain about how much is sustainable without taxpayer subsidy. But it has done so without sacrificing other, more reliable forms of energy. Texas remains America’s largest oil-producing state.

To quote Justice Brandeis fully, he spoke about states being laboratories that would allow ideas to be tested “without risk to the rest of the country”. When it comes to energy policy, we can see precisely this.

America allows the iron-clad certainties of the renewable lobby to be tested by reality. Indeed, the country works so well because it has been built on the assumption that we cannot know for certain what approach will prove best. America is, to borrow the ungainly phrase coined by Friedrich Hayek, built on “evolutionary rationalism”, the idea that the right answer emerges through trial and error.

Europe and Britain have worse policies on energy and much else because they are governed by what Hayek called constructive rationalism, the assumption that we can build the best by deliberate design. Perhaps if they are to prosper, they need not only an American style of energy policy. They need a system of governance that allows trial and error. The alternative will be perpetual mistakes.

The Engineering Services Agreement (ESA), announced Oct. 2, 2025, tasks Hitachi Energy with delivering early-stage engineering services—including technical specifications for two HVDC converter stations, covering electrical ratings, valve hall layouts, control-system architecture, and harmonic mitigation studies. It also includes dynamic and steady-state system modeling and AC–DC interface definitions for integration with Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).

Grid United will advance corridor refinement, land-rights acquisition, stakeholder engagement, environmental permitting support, and supply-chain sequencing for long-lead items such as transformers, smoothing reactors, and converter valves. Procurement timelines will be aligned with the project’s permitting and construction schedule.

Bridging the Crucial East-West Gap

The project marks a significant advance for Hitachi Energy’s ambitions to bridge the Eastern and Western electrical interconnections, which federal studies have long identified as one of the nation’s most consequential grid vulnerabilities. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) October 2024 National Transmission Planning (NTP) Study found that “significantly more transmission needs to be built in the U.S.—roughly two to three times the current transmission system—to meet future demand growth, reliability requirements, and achieve existing and potential future public policy goals.” That expansion, the study said, would “enhance grid reliability as it allows more resources to be shared across regions and energy to be moved from where it is available to where it is needed,” particularly during “large-scale extreme weather events.”

A crucial structural gap, according to a January 2025 study from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), stems from the grid’s topology: the U.S. lacks coordinated interregional transmission planning and physical transfer capacity between its major electrical interconnections. The report found “a lack of comprehensive, multi-value interregional transmission planning processes… and no planning organization or authority responsible for interregional transmission planning.” It also concludes that “improving interregional transmission can enhance grid reliability as it allows more resources to be shared across regions and energy to be moved from where it is available to where it is needed.” That isolation, the authors caution, heightens system congestion, curtails low-cost renewable power in the Plains and Interior West, and undermines resilience “during large-scale extreme weather events,” when the ability to shift power between regions could avert outages and lower costs.

According to Hitachi Energy and Grid United, the NPC is designed to address that deficiency. The ±525-kV HVDC system will link eastern Montana and western North Dakota to create a controllable, bidirectional bridge between the WECC, MISO, and SPP to transport up to 3 GW in either direction between the eastern and western U.S. “NPC will help address fast-growing electricity demand driven by AI data centers and industrial electrification. It will play a key role in enabling the sharing of power between grids serving different parts of the country,” the companies said on Thursday.

The ESA builds on the companies’ first landmark announcement about the concept in March 2024. That announcement outlined a plan for Hitachi Energy to provide HVDC technology across multiple Grid United transmission projects. The companies framed the effort as a way to “dramatically boost transmission capacity across the U.S. to support the urgent need for smooth sharing of power between energy markets at a time of drastically increasing demand for electricity,” while “help[ing] overcome one of the most persistent bottlenecks in the energy transition in the U.S. by bridging the east–west divide.”

That 2024 collaboration, notably, also introduced a novel capacity reservation framework that allows Hitachi Energy to pre-allocate manufacturing capacity and streamline delivery across successive HVDC projects. Hitachi has said the mechanism echoes a business model the company had previously applied with European utilities to accelerate transmission build-out. Hitachi Energy executives characterized the approach as a supply chain innovation designed to “enable speed and scale in the supply chain” and “make important contributions to streamlining the development process to help accelerate the energy transition.”

Interregional HVDC Link Promises Major Reliability Gains

According to Grid United’s North Plains Connector website, the line is “entering the permitting phase and initiating regulatory filings, with approvals expected in 2026.” Construction could begin in 2028, and the line is expected to be operational in 2032. The company also notes that it is “coordinating with local utilities for long term operation and maintenance of the transmission line.”

In August 2024, the $3.2 billion HVDC project was selected to receive $700 million by the Biden administration under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. The DOE’s website indicates those funds have been awarded with a recipient cost share of $2.8 billion.

While the project is designed to be technology agnostic and bidirectional, a June 2024 independent reliability evaluation conducted by Astrapé Consulting and reviewed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that the North Plains Connector could deliver substantial reliability benefits across interconnections, with an effective load-carrying capability (ELCC) totaling roughly 3,550 MW (ceeding the project’s 3,000-MW transfer rating because of complementary seasonal load diversity).

The study found the project “provides significant reliability benefit in all zones” and quantified its value at about 1,800 MW for WECC—primarily from winter reliability improvements—and 1,350 MW and 400 MW for SPP and MISO, respectively, tied to summer peaks. Astrapé attributed those benefits to the ability of the project’s east–west connection to take advantage of regional diversity in seasonal loads and resources, which could reduce the probability of simultaneous shortfalls and increase the effective reliability of all three systems.

According to Grid United, the project could also respond rapidly to peak demand, extreme weather events, and dynamic load shifts between the Eastern and Western Interconnections. It noted that in addition to increasing demand, “at least three primary factors affect the ability of the U.S.’s electrical grid to reliably deliver energy to consumers and are hastening the need for significant transmission infrastructure investment.”

“Changes in public policy are reducing reliable baseload generation, rapid changes in the generation resource portfolio mix are affecting reliability, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events are impacting system reliability,” it says. “This high-capacity, bidirectional connection into regional generation and transmission hubs is intended to improve reliability and resiliency across both Interconnections by increasing transfer capacity and access to additional generation in new markets, and by providing the ability to shift power quickly and efficiently to address peak demand or extreme weather events.”

Still, while the ESA represents a key step forward in development, it does not constitute a final investment decision. Under the ESA, Hitachi Energy will deliver early-stage engineering services, including the development of technical specifications for the HVDC converter stations. “This approach reduces project risk, enables proactive supply chain management, and accelerates and streamlines project execution,” Hitachi noted.

A Historic Project—And Other Efforts to Bridge the Divide

On Thursday, company officials hailed the historic nature of the project. “North Plains Connector will be the first transmission system connecting three major U.S. energy markets, supporting a key goal of the U.S. Department of Energy for interregional transmission connections to enhance grid reliability and resilience,” said Allie Wahrenberger, vice president of Engineering for Grid United. “We are excited to be moving forward with world-class engineering from Hitachi Energy, a company committed to our shared goal of improving grid reliability and resilience for millions of Americans.”

“This new agreement with Grid United is a perfect example of how a long-term collaboration built on trust and a shared vision can accelerate the project and mitigate risk,” said Nathanael Occenad, Vice President, Regional HVDC Sales Manager for the Americas of Hitachi Energy. “We are proud to support Grid United to advance this project, which is so critical to the expansion of the U.S. grid in the face of skyrocketing electricity demand.”

The project, however, isn’t the first to explore bridging the East-West gap. The Tres Amigas Project, a project unveiled in 2009 by New Mexico’s then-governor, Bill Richardson, sought to unite the Eastern, Western, and Texas Interconnections with superconductor electricity “pipelines” (which combine conventional underground pipeline construction with DC superconductor power transmission cables and multi-terminal (voltage-source) AC/DC power converters). While the 73-mile, 345-kV, 750 MW–capacity line project received DOE seed grants and early engineering, it faltered in 2015 when Xcel subsidiary Southwestern Public Service (the Eastern grid gateway) withdrew its interconnection agreement, leaving ERCOT unwilling to join under FERC jurisdiction. Efforts that followed to downsize the project’s scope and revise business models failed to regain momentum, and the project ceased in 2017. Its demise, however, echoed key barriers—fragmented regulatory authority, uncertain offtake commitments, and high upfront costs—that have hampered the large-scale build out of transmission infrastructure for decades.

Efforts to bridge the East-West divide appear to be burgeoning—again—under the pressure of AI-driven load growth and industrial electrification. The Biden administration’s National Transmission Planning Study and PNNL’s interregional pathways analysis have identified multiple ±500 kV HVDC corridors—including NPC—as critical to unlocking resource diversity and cutting congestion costs by up to $490 billion through 2050. The Trump administration’s July 2025 America’s AI Action Plan directs federal agencies to enhance the efficiency and performance of the existing transmission system through advanced line upgrades and incentives, but it does not explicitly endorse or call for new HVDC corridors. In July, notably, the Trump administration halted a $4.9 billion loan commitment for the Grain Belt Express, an HVDC project intended to connect wind and solar across Kansas and Missouri.

IN THE NEWS

Congress failed to approve government funding legislation by its October 1 deadline, resulting in a shutdown. During this funding lapse, mandatory spending such as social security benefits and postal services will continue, and “essential” federal employees will remain at work unpaid but entitled to later backpay, while other employees are furloughed, or placed on a temporary, unpaid leave. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office reported that about 750,000 employees could be furloughed, although Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought reportedly suggested that the Administration would permanently fire some federal employees in lieu of furloughs. Vought previously directed federal agencies to identify programs “not consistent with the President’s priorities” and prepare plans for permanent firings in the event of a shutdown.

The U.S. Supreme Court deferred the Trump Administration’s request to immediately remove Lisa Cook from her position as member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Court’s order allows Cook to participate in upcoming Federal Reserve meetings and delays any change in control of its board. The Court set oral arguments for January 2026 to consider whether President Donald J. Trump may fire Cook for alleged mortgage fraud before she joined the Federal Reserve. Lower courts have blocked President Trump’s firing attempt, finding that his allegations likely do not satisfy the law’s “for cause” requirement that there be evidence of wrongdoing to justify a dismissal.

The Trump Administration announced a coordinated plan between several agencies to open 13.1 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to upgrade or recommission coal plants around the country. The U.S. Department of the Interior will open the federal lands and lower the rates companies must pay to extract coal. The U.S Department of Energy will provide the grants to extend the lifespan of existing coal plants and improve electricity reliability. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will delay deadlines for coal-fired power plants to comply with wastewater pollution limits. This coordinated plan follows an executive order issued by President Trump earlier this year aimed at boosting the coal industry.

The Trump Administration announced a deal with Pfizer to sell its drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices through a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, set to launch in 2026. Under the agreement, Pfizer pledged to match prices for new drugs in the United States to those in other developed countries and extend similar price-matching terms to Medicaid. Experts cautioned, however, that savings may be limited because discounts apply only to uninsured patients and are based on high list prices. In return for the deal, the Trump Administration granted Pfizer a three-year exemption from proposed tariffs.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended barring Harvard University from receiving federal funding or entering into contracts with the federal government. HHS’s Office for Civil Rights previously claimed that Harvard had acted with “deliberate indifference” toward discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students. HHS began formal administrative proceedings to decide if Harvard will be deemed ineligible for federal funds and stated that the university has 20 days to notify the agency if it will exercise its right to a hearing. Suspension and exclusion from funding and contracts apply across all agencies.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland sued to stop President Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, an action the President characterized as protecting the city, and particularly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, from “domestic terrorists.” The lawsuit accuses the President of federalizing the Oregon National Guard for the illegal purpose of civilian law enforcement and of trampling constitutional principles by singling out “politically disfavored jurisdictions” for retribution. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the deployment in a memo directing U.S. Attorneys in the District of Oregon to prosecute “every person suspected of threatening or assaulting a federal law enforcement officer” to the greatest extent possible.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new generic version of the abortion pill, clearing a drug manufacturer to sell tablets of mifepristone that are equivalent to the long-available drug Mifeprex. The move is expected to expand access to medication abortions, which make up about two-thirds of all U.S. abortions. The approval produced sharp criticism from anti-abortion groups and Republican lawmakers, who urged the Trump Administration to reverse policies that allow abortion pills to be distributed by mail.

A new California law strengthens protections for employee whistleblowers at major AI companies and requires companies to disclose their safety protocols and report critical safety incidents. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who vetoed a stricter AI bill last year, commended the new law in a public letter. Newsom stated that future AI regulation will involve collaboration with the federal government, and the new law allows federal regulations to replace some of its own provisions in certain cases.

A federal court ruled in favor of Meta, ending a lawsuit that alleged that the company misled Facebook users about its privacy protections. The plaintiffs argued that although Facebook is free to use, they were nonetheless financially harmed by Meta’s misrepresentations because if users had known what data they were providing, Meta would have paid users $5.00 per months in a competitive market to access that data. U.S. District Judge James Donato rejected the plaintiffs’ expert testimony in support of this theory, ending the lawsuit. Meta still faces a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging that the company strategically acquired competitors such as Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain a monopoly on personal social networking.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

In a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, Cavit Baran, a professor at Sabancı University, and several coauthors examined the effect of electric vehicle use on air quality and child health. Using county-level data from 2010 to 2021, the Baran team compared electric vehicle registrations to levels of nitrogen dioxide—a harmful pollutant linked to vehicle emissions—and several health measures including low infant birth weights, preterm births, and asthma-related emergency department visits. Baran and his coauthors found that a one-unit increase in electric vehicles per 1,000 vehicles led to significant declines in pollutant levels and reduced negative child health outcomes. They recommended increasing investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage adoption of electric vehicles and further improve health.

In an essay in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Raúl Carrillo, Academic Fellow at Columbia Law School, examined how financial technology (“fintech”) companies such as Venmo, Cash App, and other “platform money” providers rely on data collection systems that expose consumers to risks they cannot reasonably avoid. He explained that data brokers gather detailed personal and financial information, often without users’ knowledge, and sell it to fintech firms that use it to shape credit decisions, advertising, and financial services. Carrillo argued that this “data maximization” model makes financial services more invasive and less secure, producing harms ranging from privacy violations to identity theft and discrimination. He contended that outdated U.S. financial data laws leave consumers vulnerable and called for stronger rules based on data minimization which would limit the collection and use of personal data.[Sean]: A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report examined the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) effectiveness at addressing sexual harassment in federally funded research institutions. In 2022, Congress directed OSTP to inventory institutions’ policies, issue guidance for improvement, and ensure compliance by October 3, 2025. The new report, however, found that OSTP-issued guidance left out some elements required by the law, such as requirements for institutions to report launched investigations or for federal agencies to share harassment reports, and that the guidance arrived 20 months behind schedule. GAO found that every included research institution would require policy updates to comply with OSTP guidance, but as of July, OSTP had not hired staff to monitor compliance as required by law, suggesting it may miss the October deadline.

EDITOR’S CHOICE

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Mark Nevitt, an associate professor of law at Emory University School of Law, argued that use of gas-powered leaf blowers should be banned. Nevitt described the negative environmental effects of these leaf blowers, which are powered by antiquated engine technology. He noted that a half-hour of yard work with a gas-powered leaf blower emits the same amount of air pollution as driving cross-country in a large pickup truck. Nevitt criticized gas-powered leaf blowers for their excessive loudness, which can result in permanent hearing loss.

The decision was disclosed on Wednesday in a post by White House budget director Russell Vought, who said: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes amid an ongoing standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

Cancelled projects

According to the Department of Energy (DOE), 223 projects were cancelled following a review that concluded they did not sufficiently advance US energy needs or were not financially sustainable.

The department stated the grants came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other divisions.

One of the most significant cancellations involves $1.2bn allocated to California’s planned hydrogen hub. Governor Gavin Newsom’s office said the hub had attracted $10bn in private investment and warned that cutting the project could endanger over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future – creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” Newsom said.

Senator Alex Padilla of California called the cancellation “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

Environmental groups expressed concern over the cuts. Jackie Wong, senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: “This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand.”

The states affected include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

Previous blows to solar

The news comes over a month since the administration’s August announcement that eligibility rules for clean energy tax credits were being tightened, threatening the country’s upcoming renewable projects. Solar, in particular, was highlighted.

August also saw the cancellation of the $7bn Solar For All programme, which was set to provide easier access to solar power for over 900,000 low-income households.

These targeted blows to the solar – and wider renewable energy – sector are part of a policy shift heralded by the signing of Executive Order 14315, Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources, and the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The motivation behind this shift is to re-prioritise fossil fuels, according to the US Department of the Interior.",https://solarstoragextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cropped-YouTube-Logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:02.454739

Local EV demand hot ahead of federal rebate deadline

The Colorado Energy Office on Thursday announced the rebate amount will increase from $6,000 to $9,000 for new electric vehicle purchases and leases and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used electric vehicle purchases and leases.

“The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay,” Polis said in a press release. “Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost. I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: get out there right now.”

According to the energy office, more than 200,000 electric vehicles are registered in Colorado, and EVs make up a quarter of new vehicle sales in 2025 so far.

Rod Schluter, the director at McDonald Volkswagen in Littleton, told FOX31’s Courtney Fromm ahead of the federal expiration that his dealership had sold almost its entire stock of EVs.

“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said in the press release. “Coloradans have made it clear that they want EVs, and with Congress revoking key incentives that save Coloradans money, we are stepping up.”

Stricter EU CO2 emissions targets are driving EV sales alongside lower prices, discounting, and the launch of new models.
EV Volumes has updated the 2025 light-vehicle sales forecast for Northern America, covering the US and Canada.
Non-triad markets weather tariffs Light-vehicle sales in non-Triad markets have weathered the economic impact of US trade tariffs better than expected.","With so many hurdles to overcome, is there still hope for electric vehicle (EV) markets around the world? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, outlines what is expected to happen to sales with Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus.

EV Volumes expects global light vehicle sales, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs), to grow by 3.6% in 2025. This exceeds the expected 1.1% increase outlined in the previous update.

The reason for this improved outlook is resilient demand in China and the non-Triad region. This forecast factors in US automotive tariffs. However, these are likely to have a smaller impact, with carmakers taking a more cautious approach with their pricing strategies. Other factors taken into consideration include political instability, conflicts, energy prices, and inflation.

Global EV deliveries, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), are forecast to increase by 24.5% this year. This means 22.1 million units are expected to hit the roads. The new forecast is up from the 19.7% growth expected in the previous update.

The improved outlook comes despite some governments phasing out purchase incentives and tax breaks amid mounting national debt, particularly in Europe.

The global EV share of the light-vehicle market is projected to grow to 24% in 2025 and 26.7% in 2026. In the following years, this is predicted to rise to 42% in 2030, before hitting 64.1% in 2035, and 83% in 2040. However, budget pressures and policy shifts may threaten investment in incentives and charging infrastructure.

European EV barriers

Western and Central Europe’s light vehicle market is currently facing a barrage of barriers to growth. There is uncertainty about changing goods tariffs, conflict in Ukraine, and tensions in the Middle East concerning European light-vehicle sales.

On top of this, there are the ongoing risks of increasing inflation, oil prices, and energy costs. Furthermore, the September 2025 OECD Economic Outlook predicts that GDP in the Euro area will only grow 1.2% in 2025. This is slightly higher than the 1% growth in the previous forecast. However, this rate is projected to retreat to 1% in 2026, down from 1.2% predicted previously.

Due to weaker goods exports to the US and a struggling services sector, LCV demand was affected by trade frictions and tariffs. Passenger vehicle sales quickly followed suit. Political uncertainty and rising debt levels are also curtailing light-vehicle demand.

More positively, the EU proposed tariff reductions in August 2025 to implement the EU-US trade agreement. This would see duties on the automotive sector reduced from 27.5% to 15%. The EU-Mercosur and EU-Mexico free-trade agreements have also strengthened the competitiveness of the region’s automotive industry. The UK has also negotiated a more favourable 10% tariff rate with the US.

A lower EV outlook

Reflecting the barriers the region faces, EV Volumes has lowered its European light-vehicle sales outlook for 2025. Volumes are now expected to decline by 1.1% year-on-year by the end of 2025. This is lower than in the previous forecast, which projected a 0.3% decline.

The 14.8 million units now expected this year are far below the 18 million registered in 2019. EV Volumes does not expect the European market to return to that level within the current forecast horizon, up to 2040. A 1.9% growth in light-vehicle sales in 2026 hinges on a complex interplay of regulatory and economic factors.

Stricter EU CO2 emissions targets are driving EV sales alongside lower prices, discounting, and the launch of new models. Additionally, the EU Commission plans to adopt a binding regulation in 2026 on vehicle recycling. This will require manufacturers to use more recyclable or reusable materials in new cars and vans.

Meeting the lower emissions targets and circularity requirements will necessitate a major increase in EV sales. In turn, this could even trigger a price war, supported by lower lithium costs. Manufacturers may also restrict the supply of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to avoid costly emissions fines.

Schemes and incentives

On a positive note, Italy announced €597 million in funding for a scrappage scheme. Meanwhile, Germany is considering the reintroduction of BEV incentives, although this is uncertain due to the coalition government and prevailing economic conditions.

In July 2025, the Electric Car Grant was launched in the UK. EV subsidies were increased for low-income households in France. Social leasing and a conditional extra financial incentive for electric models were launched at the end of September. Spain has also reactivated subsidies under the MOVES III scheme.

Meanwhile, more affordable BEVs are entering the market, and leading Chinese carmakers are planning further moves in the region.

PHEV registrations have exceeded expectations so far this year. This has been driven by eased CO2 targets, expanded Chinese PHEV offerings, and delayed launches of low-cost BEVs. Additionally, the UK’s ZEV mandate relaxation means hybrids can be sold until 2035, exempting them from the 2030 new-car ICE ban.

As a result, EV sales in Europe are expected to grow 26.7% year-on-year in 2025 to 3.88 million units. This accounts for 26.2% of total light-vehicle sales, up from 20.5% in 2024 and 21.3% in 2023. BEV volumes are forecast to grow 23.8% year-on-year, accounting for 67.1% of the 2025 BEV and PHEV mix. Meanwhile, PHEV sales are expected to increase by 32.8%.

So, what do new model launches, lower prices, and stricter emissions targets mean in the following years? EVs are forecast to reach a 30.6% share of European light-vehicle sales in 2026 and 36.5% in 2027.

The forecast for 2035 and beyond includes some tolerance for timing interpretations of the new-car ICE sales ban. It also allows for exemptions for vehicles that may be deemed unsuitable for full electrification.

Chinese resilience

Automotive demand and economic resilience have remained firm in China. The OECD recently upgraded the country’s 2025 GDP growth outlook to 4.9%. Meanwhile, EV Volumes has upgraded its light-vehicle market forecast for China. A total of 27.7 million sales are now expected by the end of 2025, equating to year-on-year growth of 6.7%.

This year has seen China’s scrappage programme extended beyond the original January 2025 deadline. However, it has now been suspended in several cities. This could disproportionately reduce demand for EVs given their higher bonus levels.

However, the country has recently announced a plan to stabilise growth in the automotive industry. Accordingly, China is targeting sales of approximately 15.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) this year. Alongside this, it is aiming for a 48% NEV penetration rate.

The country also pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions at the latest UN General Assembly. By 2035, China will look to reduce its emissions by up to 10% from their peak levels. This marks the nation’s first commitment to absolute emissions cuts.

Chinese OEMs continue to launch new PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs). Meanwhile, BEVs are regaining momentum, bolstered by aggressive discounting initiated by BYD.

As such, BEVs are forecast to account for 60.1% of EV sales in 2025 and about two thirds by 2031. EVs are forecast to represent 51.6% of light-vehicle sales in 2025, rising to 73% in 2030, then 88.3% in 2035, and 95.7% in 2040.

Forecast volumes are based on retail sales, not wholesale. This excludes exports and inventory build-up, which explains differences from the typically higher wholesale-based figures published by other agencies.

Tariffs, bills and incentives

On 26 March, the US government announced 25% vehicle import duties. However, a two-year ‘import adjustment offset’ program has been implemented for manufacturers producing vehicles in the US.

According to J.D. Power, average new car prices in the US are expected to increase by 5% by the end of 2025. This could lead to an 8% drop in sales. However, many manufacturers did initially absorb the extra costs.

The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ act was signed into law in July 2025, ending EV tax credits on 30 September. Any resulting pull-forward effect so far in 2025 is expected to be offset by weaker demand in the final quarter.

Funding for Canada’s iZEV programme ran out in January 2025, with BEV uptake falling and no replacement scheme announced. In response to economic and trade pressures, the Canadian federal government also paused the 2026 Electric Vehicle Availability Standard. This mandated that 20% of new light-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission. The government initiated a 60-day review to assess and potentially adjust future targets.

EV Volumes has updated the 2025 light-vehicle sales forecast for Northern America, covering the US and Canada. The region is now expected to record just over 18 million sales, up 1.2% year-on-year. However, the year-on-year growth outlook was adjusted downward for 2026 to 2029.

The EV share is now expected to reach 10.1% in 2025 and rise only modestly to 10.2% in 2026. This is primarily supported by a more affordable Tesla model. EV shares are forecast to climb to 21.4% in 2030, before achieving 39.8% in 2035, and 59.1% in 2040. This is well below the predicted global EV share of over 80% in 2040.

Non-triad markets weather tariffs

Light-vehicle sales in non-Triad markets have weathered the economic impact of US trade tariffs better than expected. Accordingly, EV Volumes increased its 2025 sales growth forecast to 4.8%.

Japan increased the budget for EV subsidies under the Clean Vehicle Energy Subsidy Programme in early 2025. Meanwhile, India cut import duties for premium EVs as part of a new manufacturing programme in June 2025.

Indonesia introduced VAT exemption for low-emission vehicles in January 2025 and a reduced VAT rate. Finally, in response to US tariffs, South Korea launched temporary stimulus measures. This included financing support and higher EV subsidies.

Budget constraints driven by economic concerns may limit future incentive schemes. Several countries have also implemented, or plan to introduce, new tariffs on imported vehicles. This includes a 50% tariff in Mexico and up to 30% duties in Turkey. Indonesia is also looking to end incentives for imported, completely built-up BEVs, starting in 2026.

Against this backdrop, the EV share in non-Triad countries is forecast to reach 6.7% in 2025. This equates to around 2.1 million units. This percentage is projected to reach 16.9% in 2030, then 41.8% in 2035, and 76.8% in 2040. The region generally lags the global adoption curve by about five years.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/EV-Charging-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 14:01:43.782875

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced Wednesday that it has terminated 321 financial awards worth more than $7.5 billion for 223 projects across 16 states, all of which voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 elections.

""Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,"" the department said in a statement.

The move comes during an impasse in federal government shutdown negotiations in the Republican-led Congress, with Democrats holding out for an extension to Biden-era healthcare tax credits that will push down the cost of health insurance.

U.S. Sen. Tina Smith claims that the Trump administration is ""bullying Minnesotans"" amid the standoff between Democrats and Republicans in Congress over health care funding.

President Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to target Democratic priorities.

""We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,"" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. ""Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.""

As well as voting for Harris last November, all 16 states impacted by the cuts are also represented by two Democrats in the U.S. Senate, though two of then – New Hampshire and Vermont – have Republican governors.

Those states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

California's U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla called the cancelation of $1.2 billion for the state's hydrogen hub ""vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.""

The Environmental Defense Fund called out Vought for his ""unlawful attempt to cancel clean energy projects in states that didn’t vote for President Trump,"" which it argues will increase electricity costs for everyone.

""In the middle of a government shutdown, these are shamelessly partisan actions, pulled straight from the Project 2025 playbook, favoring insiders in the fossil fuel industry and punishing American families,"" the environmental organization wrote in a statement Thursday.

Trump shared on social media Thursday that he's meeting with Vought, whom the president identified as ""of PROJECT 2025 Fame"" to talk about ""which of the many Democrat Agencies"" could be cut, either temporarily or permanently.

“I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity. They are not stupid people, so maybe this is their way of wanting to, quietly and quickly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

During his 2024 campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, a controversial policy blueprint drafted by the Heritage Foundation.

As with much of the real estate industry, property technology, generally defined as the use of tech and software to make real estate and property management more efficient, took a big hit in recent years.

Higher interest rates, a capital market retraction and a push by almost all venture capital into artificial intelligence collectively hit property tech hard. While there is, of course, some AI in property tech, it hasn't been enough to really drive interest in a sector that has historically been extremely slow to modernize.

""I'd say we just lived through probably the most challenging three years that certainly I've ever experienced,"" said Brendan Wallace, co-founder and CEO of Fifth Wall. ""You saw a lot of companies and new businesses and venture funds die. We just lived through an extinction event.""

Fifth Wall is a venture capital fund managing over $3 billion in capital, the largest investment firm focused on technology for the built environment.

Wallace said the winter is over for property tech, citing last year's IPO of ServiceTitan , a cloud-based field service management software for trades such as HVAC, plumbing, electrical and landscaping. The company raised about $625 million in its initial public offering, and shares jumped 42% in their Nasdaq debut.

Wallace also noted new unicorns, such as Juniper Square and Bilt, which bode well for the future of property tech investing. Bilt, a platform offering loyalty rewards for housing, raised $250 million in July at a $10.75 billion valuation in a funding round led by General Catalyst and GID, including a strategic investment from United Wholesale Mortgage.

""The amount of enterprise value destruction that happened to prop tech was unprecedented from 2022 to 2024, but the amount of enterprise value creation that has just happened in the last 15 months has also been unprecedented,"" Wallace said.

That is not the case, however, in climate-related property tech. That space is becoming increasingly challenged due to the political winds in the U.S. that have shifted dramatically away from sustainability and climate resilience, not to mention climate science overall. As a result, the entire climate tech ecosystem in real estate is suffering.

Again, real estate has always been slow to modernize and was particularly slow to decarbonize. It got a huge boost, however, from President Joe Biden's administration and billions of dollars in public funding, much of which went to decarbonizing real estate overall. Then, Wallace said, the world shifted under its feet.

""Many climate funds are struggling to raise. Many real estate owners are deprioritizing sustainability, decarbonization and ESG [environmental, social and governance], and there is a palpable, negative sentiment shift that has set on climate-related prop tech,"" Wallace explained. ""And so what that means is we're still supporting our companies. We're actually still seeing lots of good progress, but the sentiment is negative.""

Despite the shift, he said he is optimistic about the sector for one powerful reason: While national policy may be anti-climate, local governments are not. Cities are running out of money, and carbon taxes are a very attractive way of raising capital. New York City is a prime example. It is not only moving much further left in its politics, but it has consistently been more environmentally progressive.

Fifth Wall, one of the biggest investors in this space, is taking the long-term play, investing while the negative ""halo"" around climate persists because valuations are attractive.

""My view is the real estate industry is still responsible for 40% of carbon emissions. It's still this industry that has shirked its responsibility for years, and it's going to cost a lot to decarbonize. It's a lot of money, and capital is going to flow into that space ... which is one of the reasons why we're still deploying capital, because we're the only ones,"" Wallace said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205276-1759172450928-BFW.JPG?v=1759172592&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-03 11:00:04.843531

Rising tariffs and resource protection are boosting the value of companies in the power and resources supply chain.
This trend is supporting higher valuations and stronger fundamentals for companies involved in the electrification value chain, in our view.
We recommend focusing on quality companies with strong infrastructure pipelines, proven execution, and the flexibility to adjust operations as market conditions evolve.","The latest round of AI capital spending is underpinning demand for electricity generation. US utility operator PG&E this week is the latest power sector company to announce major grid upgrades and transmission projects, pledging USD 73bn in new spending by 2030 to meet the needs of data centers and AI-driven demand. On Monday, Vistra Corp. announced a 20-year contract to sell 1,200 megawatts of power from its Comanche Peak nuclear plant in Texas to a large unnamed customer (likely a data center). Nationwide, power consumption is forecast to reach record highs in 2025 and 2026, according to the US Energy Information Administration, as data center developers face mounting grid constraints.

In response, the US energy secretary said the government would intervene via emergency powers to delay the retirement of most coal-fired power plants and to accelerate the reopening of nuclear plants. These moves are part of a broader strategy to boost energy output, including regulatory reforms to speed up nuclear permitting and efforts to expand backup generation. The resulting increase in power sector spending is in line with our forecasts for USD 3tr in annual investment across power generation, energy storage, grid infrastructure, and data centers by 2030, backed by strong commercial customer demand to secure capacity for new projects.

Despite these investments and policy shifts, we believe many investors are underestimating both the scale and the durability of the electrification opportunity:

Strong order books and backlogs signal sustained demand. Utilities and electrical equipment firms are reporting record order backlogs, supported by incremental growth in the pipeline of data center plans. Channel checks suggest commercial customers are eager to secure power and equipment for their projects as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, utility companies' guidance suggests a healthy pipeline of power contracts—either already signed, in advanced discussion, or expected to materialize soon.

Critical minerals and resource nationalism add to tailwinds. Rising tariffs and resource protection are boosting the value of companies in the power and resources supply chain. We have observed a renewed focus on the importance of critical minerals, illustrated by rising resource nationalism and the implementation of protective trade measures. This trend is supporting higher valuations and stronger fundamentals for companies involved in the electrification value chain, in our view.

Valuation premiums look justified by superior earnings per share (EPS) growth. Our favored electrification stocks offer significantly higher potential EPS growth—10 percentage points in 2025 and 7 percentage points in 2026—over global equities (MSCI ACWI Index), according to Factset consensus. Despite their modestly higher valuations compared to the wider market, we think these companies offer robust risk-adjusted return prospects.

So we retain our high conviction for durable organic growth across the power and resources sector on the back of AI-driven demand, continued electrification, and solid policy support. We recommend focusing on quality companies with strong infrastructure pipelines, proven execution, and the flexibility to adjust operations as market conditions evolve. While the opportunity is substantial, investors should remain mindful of regulatory and execution risks, particularly around legacy asset upgrades and permitting, though we see these as manageable within a diversified approach.",https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/chief-investment-office/house-view/daily/2025/latest-03102025/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.227420959.img/outlook-lavin-village-four.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:29.249636

The urgent need for legal framework for storage was also highlighted at a breakfast held at the Federal Senate in Brasília on Wednesday.
That The Urgency of the Legal Framework for Storage event was organized by the Brazilian Association of Energy Storage Solutions (ABSAE), ABSolar and the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (Abeeólica) and was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).
Attendees at the breakfast released a draft text proposing a storage framework which could be included in Provisional Measure (MP) 1,304, which sets a limit of electricity bill subsidies and could address electricity sector reform.
Brazil cannot wait until 2028 to finalize regulation or implement projects at scale.","Brazil faces an energy paradox. On the one hand, it boasts one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world, with 85% of its electricity coming from renewable energy sources anchored by solar and wind power. Much of that clean energy, however, is “curtailed” – wasted – with gigawatt-hours lost daily as expensive, polluting thermal plants continue to operate.

The curtailment problem means energy storage could be an essential solution but the technology still lacks the consolidated regulation that would enable its full adoption.

At a Legal Framework and Sub-Legal Regulation for Energy Storage event held by the Brazilian Association of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (ABSolar) in São Paulo on Tuesday, representatives from the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), the legal sector, and energy and technology companies focused on a single message: Brazil needs to expedite the creation of a regulatory framework for storage and must adopt emergency measures to transform renewable energy abundance into energy security.

The urgent need for legal framework for storage was also highlighted at a breakfast held at the Federal Senate in Brasília on Wednesday. That The Urgency of the Legal Framework for Storage event was organized by the Brazilian Association of Energy Storage Solutions (ABSAE), ABSolar and the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (Abeeólica) and was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).

Attendees at the breakfast released a draft text proposing a storage framework which could be included in Provisional Measure (MP) 1,304, which sets a limit of electricity bill subsidies and could address electricity sector reform. The document considers batteries connected to generation sites, to the transmission grid, and small-scale, “distributed generation” (DG) batteries connected directly to energy users.

Regulation

At the ABSolar event, ANEEL Secretary General Daniel Cardoso Danna highlighted the progress of a regulatory process begun in 2020 with a Subsidy Collection, and which advanced to Public Consultation No. 39, of 2023, receiving 652 contributions from society and the private sector.

Danna said the agency has made progress on crucial decisions such as classifying storage operators as independent power producers – with a 35-year concession – and establishing the possibility of autonomous systems or sites co-located with power plants. Crucial issues such as pricing and applicable charges remain under debate, however.

“ANEEL’s mission is to provide favorable conditions for market development, balancing the interests of stakeholders and ensuring benefits for society,” said Danna. “We are 95% to 99% complete in this process and hope to soon consolidate a robust regulatory framework capable of providing legal certainty and predictability to the sector.” He added, the regulatory process will be completed in 2028, after two stages to address reversible plants, network cost sharing, and improvements to power cut prevention.

Curtailment: a ‘national tragedy‘

While ANEEL provided the institutional perspective, Grupo Energia CEO Rubens Brandt emphasized the need to address clean energy curtailment.

Presenting data from August, Brandt said wastage averaged 5.8 GWh, the equivalent of switching off the entire load of the state of Paraná and around 7% of national electricity consumption. “It’s an alarming situation,” said the CEO. “In August, we wasted the equivalent of the guaranteed generation of Belo Monte and Itaipu combined. We cannot treat cutting renewable energy while keeping thermal plants operating as normal. This is a national tragedy.”

The executive also pointed out blackouts are most frequent during mornings, and especially weekend and national holiday mornings: precisely when solar radiation is at its highest. Curtailment of clean power while thermal power generation continues illustrates lack of flexibility in system planning, according to Brandt.

“We’ve been discussing storage for five years while other countries have been moving forward for more than 15 years,” said the chief executive. “We can’t wait until 2029 to act. Batteries are our energy time machine: they allow us to store surplus energy in the morning and release it in the afternoon, replacing expensive and polluting thermal plants.”

Regulatory certainty

Henrique Reis, a partner at Demarest, said investors will not fully commit to storage without a clear legal framework for the technology. He said the definition of frameworks, rights, and duties is as important, if not more so, than the technology itself.

“The private sector is already seeing opportunities but, without legal certainty, there won’t be scale,” said Reis. “Brazil needs a robust and stable legal framework that provides clear conditions for investors, avoiding regulatory uncertainty and contractual bottlenecks.”

The Demarest partner said the success of Brazil’s solar and wind power sectors was only possible because a stable regulatory environment encouraged investment.v The same needs to happen for storage, Reis added.

Digital solutions

Closing the ABSolar event, Volt Robotics CEO Donato Filho said storage, far from offering just “arbitrage” opportunities to capitalize on energy price fluctuation could instead be a multi-functional solution offering services to the electricity system and consumers.

“Limiting batteries to arbitration alone would be like using a modern smartphone only to make calls,” said Filho. “Like cell phones, they have multiple applications: backup; ancillary services; consumption optimization; and, of course, curtailment reduction. It’s a versatile and strategic technology.”

Filho presented a model developed by his company – based on artificial intelligence inspired by genetic algorithms – illustrating the optimal battery size for electricity consumers and generators. Volt expects economic viability will arrive by next year, given the expected continued fall in battery prices.

“We’re applying artificial intelligence to identify lowest-cost, highest-benefit scenarios,” said the CEO. “The results already show that the systems pay for themselves in just a few years, especially when we consider all the services they can offer. It’s a solution for today, not a decade from now.”

Act now

It was unanimously agreed time is the greatest enemy. Brazil cannot wait until 2028 to finalize regulation or implement projects at scale. That would risk losing competitiveness, wasting ever-increasing amounts of renewable energy, and compromising the country’s strategic role in the global energy transition.

Energy storage, as the industry insiders emphasized, is not just a technological trend, it represents a structural condition for the future of the electricity sector that is capable of reducing costs, ensuring safety, integrating intermittently-generating electricity sources, and accelerating decarbonization. The message was clear: Brazil must transform urgency into action.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Brazil.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:38.898184

Among those set to lose tens of millions of dollars in anticipated funding are power giant Exelon, the University of Illinois, the nonprofit Gas Technology Institute, which is based in Des Plaines, and a handful of other entities in Illinois, according to congressional Democrats who released the full list when Trump’s Energy Department and Office of Management and Budget did not.

The director of the OMB, Russell Vought, made the announcement shortly after Congress forced the federal government into a shutdown. On social media, he called the funds that were targeted to be cut “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda,” suggesting the choices in funding cuts were highly political.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement that the cuts aim to eliminate 33 awards in Illinois, totaling more than $673 million, but that $90 million of that amount had already been spent. That translates to a loss of approximately $583 million.

The money was slated for transportation electrification, solar energy, “green” buildings and a range of other energy initiatives, according to a document released by Duckworth’s office.

In her statement, Duckworth said she thought “there is no legal justification whatsoever” for the funding cuts.

“Unsurprisingly for anyone familiar with how Trump operates, the more than 300 projects cancelled are overwhelmingly in states that did not vote for him in the 2024 election,” Duckworth said. “This abrupt cancellation not only jeopardizes local and regional economic growth but also sends a concerning message to researchers, entrepreneurs, unions and communities nationwide who rely on the federal government to act in good faith and in the national interest.”

The U.S. Department of Energy said on X that it chopped the hundreds of obligated awards nationwide “following a thorough, individualized financial review.”

These “projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the department said.

Recipients can appeal the decision, the department said. Energy Department officials did not respond to a request for additional details.

Since Trump entered office in January, his administration has targeted spending on environmentally friendly projects and called such efforts a “scam.” He called climate change a “con job” during a recent speech at the United Nations. At several points he has also clawed back money, attempted mass firings and ended programs in a push to cut costs, breaking norms and angering Democrats and organizations that rely on consistent federal funding.

Before Congress failed to approve a funding plan to keep the federal government operating, Trump threatened that he’d use the shutdown to punish political enemies, which would include Illinois, a state that has resoundingly rejected his three bids for the presidency.

The hardest hit in Illinois this week appeared to be the nonprofit GTI, which was set to have more than $400 million in awards terminated, according to the list from Duckworth. Those awards were intended for carbon capture technology projects and the study of methane emissions, among other initiatives, the document said.

The awards also included more than $30 million for carbon capture and other projects at the University of Illinois, as well as $100 million for Exelon and $50 million for its subsidiary, Commonwealth Edison, for electric grid modernization in Illinois, according to Duckworth’s list.

Some other recipients of smaller terminated awards in Illinois included Cook County, the American Lung Association and Northwestern University. One project for hydrogen use in heavy machinery by construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar was slated to occur in Chillicothe, in Peoria County, which is part of Republican U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood’s district, while the rest are affiliated with Democratic districts, according to a list from House Appropriations Committee Democrats.

One top-ranking Illinois Senate member, who is active on energy-related issues at the state Capitol, said what the Trump administration is doing “is a mistake.”

“If you’re an advocate of domestic energy production, which the administration claims to be, this would be the last thing you would be doing,” said Democratic state Sen. Bill Cunningham of Chicago. “This is cutting off domestic energy production.”

Trafigura, a company in the global commodities industry, purchased the ammonia for shipment to Envalior, a provider of Engineering Materials, which intends to use the low-carbon ammonia for the production of low-carbon caprolactam.
The low-carbon ammonia is certified under the Verified Ammonia Carbon Intensity (VACI) Programme to have a significantly lower well-to-gate carbon footprint than conventional natural gas-based ammonia production.
CF Industries expects to produce approximately 1.9 million t of VACI-certified low-carbon ammonia on an annual basis, which can also be upgraded into low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer products.
The shipment of low-carbon ammonia by Trafigura and Envalior represents CF Industries' second low-carbon ammonia delivery following an earlier sale to a customer in Africa.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc., a producer of ammonia, has announced a shipment of certified low-carbon ammonia from its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, US, facility. Trafigura, a company in the global commodities industry, purchased the ammonia for shipment to Envalior, a provider of Engineering Materials, which intends to use the low-carbon ammonia for the production of low-carbon caprolactam.

Trafigura has loaded 23 500 t of low-carbon ammonia on the 25th of September destined for Antwerp, Belgium. The low-carbon ammonia is certified under the Verified Ammonia Carbon Intensity (VACI) Programme to have a significantly lower well-to-gate carbon footprint than conventional natural gas-based ammonia production.

We are proud to partner with industry leaders Trafigura and Envalior as we work together to develop a low-carbon ammonia supply chain in advance of the implementation of the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism,” said Bert Frost, executive vice president, sales, market development and supply chain, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. “We also are pleased to reach an important milestone for CF Industries by delivering our first low-carbon premium offering to Europe.

We are pleased to be delivering our first low-carbon ammonia cargo to Europe. This milestone would not have been possible without the support from CF Industries and Envalior, and we are looking forward to working together on our shared vision of developing low-carbon solutions for industrial use,"" commented Patricio Norris, Trafigura's Global Head of Ammonia and LPG.

At Envalior, sustainability is not just part of our strategy – it is part of who we are. This shipment of low-carbon ammonia marks a significant step in our journey to decarbonise our supply chain and deliver climate-resilient solutions. By integrating certified low-carbon feedstocks into our production of caprolactam/ammonium sulphate and downstream into PA6, we are showing our commitment to low-carbon materials and helping our customers meet their environmental goals,” added Thorsten Bredemann, VP Global Marketing & Sales Intermediates.

The start-up of CF Industries’ carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage project at its Donaldsonville Complex in July 2025, which has the capacity to sequester up to 2 million tpy of CO2 generated by the ammonia manufacturing process, enabled the production of low-carbon ammonia at the site. CF Industries expects to produce approximately 1.9 million t of VACI-certified low-carbon ammonia on an annual basis, which can also be upgraded into low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer products.

VACI is a voluntary programme developed by The Fertilizer Institute that certifies the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from ammonia production at a specific facility from natural gas well to production gate. The programme utilises a published methodology developed by industry experts to calculate the carbon intensity of the facility's ammonia production. The data collection and calculations are audited by a third-party verifier.

Willis III, Amanda Jayne Miller, Tami Silverman",,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/03/state-losing-traction-on-business-climate-economic-development/,"Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics.
They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month.
In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth.
The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.
“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor.","Indiana’s business climate has been an advantage for a decade or more — consistently landing the state enviably high in various economic development metrics. But that tide might be turning, and some mayors are concerned about the change.

Gov. Mike Braun brings a different style — and fewer handouts to corporations. He repeatedly attacked the state’s previous goals for focusing only on large companies while failing smaller businesses while on the campaign trail.

Crawfordsville Mayor Todd Barton said that sudden shift is causing companies to back away from the Hoosier state.

“They don’t trust us. They don’t trust the state of Indiana,” he told a panel of lobbyists and public relations experts last month. “There’s a loss of sense of direction. And I’m not going to say I totally was always on board with the direction before, but we had a direction, right? And sometimes it was a little confusing, but at least we had a sense of direction.”

Barton said on recent trips with site selectors he has seen a decided shift against bringing investment and job growth to Indiana.

“For years, we’d go to those meetings and they were like, ‘Oh, you’re from Indiana. You guys are rock stars…we’ll put projects in Indiana every single day.’

“This year, I’ve been on three different trips, and every single trip, all we heard was, ‘Eh, we don’t know.’ We do not have — to the outside world — a clear economic development policy in the state of Indiana right now. Period. “

And it’s not just anecdotal.

In 2024, Area Development — a national publication dedicated to site selection and economic development — ranked the top states for doing business and Indiana was fifth. The state especially excelled in the key categories of overall cost, access to qualified labor, business incentive programs, logistics and infrastructure.

Compare that same ranking for 2025. Indiana dropped to 12th for top states to do business.

And here is how Indiana fared in key categories:

Overall cost – 1st to 5th

Access to qualified labor – 4th to 6th

Availability of sites – 4th to not ranked

Business incentive programs – 3rd to not ranked

Logistics and infrastructure – 3rd to 7th

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation has had some organizational changes in the last nine months. Its executive director left in September after being hired in January. Braun replaced the entire board in June, and the quasi-governmental agency has been part of a forensic spending audit.

Lawmakers also mandated the hiring of a second leader, and that still hasn’t happened five months later.

“Gov. Braun’s economic development strategy is to grow jobs and increase wages. He is prioritizing regional input and leadership from around the state, which is a shift away from the central Indiana-focused approach of recent years,” said Commerce Secretary David Adams. “This strategy is already working, as the most recent numbers show, with incentivized jobs paying on average $8,000 more per year and costing only a third of what they did a year ago.”

Braun has urged his administration to focus less on large employers in central Indiana, instead looking at growth opportunities for communities around the state. A large swath of counties also have resisted energy-related developments such as wind, solar and data centers, which could be impacting rankings.

Last week, the governor highlighted that year-over-year, the average wage of jobs incentivized by the IEDC to come to Indiana has increased from $37 to $41, a 10% increase. The average cost per incentivized job decreased from $55,000 per job to $16,000 per job.

That’s partly because the state no longer has federal money to spend for incentives. Under former Gov. Eric Holcomb there was hundreds of millions to give out. But the budget for the IEDC has dropped 60% — meaning less money to spread around.

The agency also noted that a recent CNBC ranking saw Indiana jump from 11th to 9th in business climate.

From an outside perspective, I can say that the IEDC was a free-wheeling, secretive entity that had entirely too much leash. And I appreciate that Braun is taking initiative and getting it under control.

Noblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said on the same panel with Barton that there are two things business leaders ask about most: health care and utility costs — both things lawmakers have wrestled to get under control.

Braun has recently targeted high energy costs in the state, appointing a new official to represent ratepayers and urging state regulators to think less about utility shareholders and more about Hoosiers paying the bill. His administration pushed certain health priorities over the finish line during the legislative session, but some had to be scaled back to get votes.

But Jensen also acknowledged that part of the problem is a changing of the guard since Braun took over in January.

“I think this vision of economic development starts at the very top, whether it be a mayor, whether it be a governor. And I think what we need to do right now is get out of our own way and go tell our story — and boldly tell our story. Not just in Indiana, but around the country and around the world. And have a clear message and a clear messenger,” Jensen said.

“I think it starts at the very top. We have to be visionary, we have to be bold, we have to be excited. We have to be transformational, and we have to get out of our own way.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Indiana_A-State-that-Works.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 13:04:08.283758

And as an anchor partner in the MACH2 Clean Hydrogen Hub, Aternium is plugged into a regional effort spanning Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland to build out clean hydrogen infrastructure.
Since the electricity comes from nearby solar and wind projects, the result is truly clean hydrogen.
Swapping out gray hydrogen for clean hydrogen could slash their carbon footprints—and having compact plants close to these users cuts transport emissions, too.
The hope now is that clean hydrogen will revitalize its industrial base and keep more value in-state.","When Andrew Cottone kicked off First State Hydrogen in 2023, nobody could’ve seen the whirlwind ahead. Fast forward a few months and with Dora Cheatham coming onboard as VP of Sales and Commercialization in early 2024, the Wilmington team rebranded as Aternium. Then on September 25, 2025, they scored a big win: a $1 million investment from the State of Delaware via the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP). Fueled by a federal SSBCI grant for early-stage clean energy ventures, they’ve got serious momentum—and the timing couldn’t be better.

Aternium isn’t going it alone. They’ve teamed up with German powerhouse Siemens for top-of-the-line electrolyzers, and Honeywell is on deck to keep everything humming with AI-driven predictive maintenance and rock-solid cybersecurity. They’re even capturing byproducts—think purified oxygen and heavy water—so every drop of feedstock pulls double duty.

“This funding is a total game-changer,” Cheatham says. “It validates our strategy and lets us fast-track compact, low-emission hydrogen production right here in the First State.”

This state backing dovetails perfectly with federal pushes—like the DOE’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act incentives and the national spotlight on hydrogen hubs. And as an anchor partner in the MACH2 Clean Hydrogen Hub, Aternium is plugged into a regional effort spanning Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland to build out clean hydrogen infrastructure.

Powering Up with Electrolysis and AI

So, what’s the secret sauce? Aternium is banking on Siemens DRL 9 electrolyzers. Unlike high-pressure systems, these modular units run at ambient pressure—no expensive compression gear and up to 15% less energy loss. Each skid can crank out tons of hydrogen daily—enough to fuel local chemical plants, data centers, or refueling stations. Since the electricity comes from nearby solar and wind projects, the result is truly clean hydrogen.

Better still, these DRL 9 units can throttle production up or down on the fly to match intermittent renewables. When solar or wind output shifts, the system adjusts in real time, boosting efficiency and helping to balance the grid during peak demand.

To keep surprises at bay, Aternium tapped Honeywell for an AI-driven predictive maintenance solution. Ultrasonic sensors and temperature probes stream data into a cloud analytics engine—safeguarded by enterprise-grade cybersecurity—so they can spot issues before they snowball, cut down maintenance costs, and extend equipment life.

Can Delaware Flip from Energy Importer to Exporter?

First up, Aternium has its eye on Kent County. Aging chemical facilities and idle industrial plots make perfect brownfield sites. Their design philosophy boils down to three key points:

Footprint efficiency: Skid-mounted modules mean minimal civil work and rapid deployment.

No on-site storage: Hydrogen’s produced to order and shipped immediately, cutting safety risks.

Scalable growth: Plants can be replicated or expanded quickly as demand rises.

All of this is driven by industrial decarbonization. Local chemical and food-processing plants need hydrogen for refining and packaging. Swapping out gray hydrogen for clean hydrogen could slash their carbon footprints—and having compact plants close to these users cuts transport emissions, too.

On the mobility front, Delaware agencies are eyeing hydrogen fuel cell buses and heavy-duty trucks to replace aging diesel fleets. A local hydrogen production source could be a real game-changer, sidestepping long-haul trucking from distant suppliers.

Who’s knocking on Aternium’s door? Data centers looking for green backup power, the Port of Wilmington exploring cleaner refueling for its big rigs, and even pipeline hookups to send hydrogen onward to Philadelphia or New York. Could Delaware flip the script and become a Delaware energy exporter? That’s the dream—though it depends on market growth and significant infrastructure build-out.

Delaware’s Chemical Roots Spark New Energy Era

Delaware’s got deep chemical roots and technical know-how, but it’s long relied on imported fuel. The hope now is that clean hydrogen will revitalize its industrial base and keep more value in-state. Beyond existing plants, offering on-site hydrogen could lure data centers, green steel makers, and anyone else craving reliable, low-carbon energy. Plus, being smack in the East Coast corridor gives Delaware strategic access to major markets.

Academic institutions are jumping in, too. The University of Delaware’s College of Engineering is lining up research partnerships, while Delaware State University’s Center for Environmental Justice is working to ensure training and job opportunities in the new hydrogen economy are accessible to all. Community colleges are developing apprenticeships and certification programs with Aternium to get technicians and engineers ready for these cutting-edge facilities.

What’s Next on Aternium’s Roadmap?

That $1 million from DASCP will cover front-end engineering and design (FEED), permitting studies, and the first round of community outreach. At the same time, Aternium is in talks with utilities like Delmarva Power about tariff structures that reward flexibility and grid services. They’re also exploring hydrogen blends in existing natural gas pipelines to ease the transition for end users.

Meanwhile, the team’s lining up private investors for a Series A round, targeting federal clean hydrogen tax credits and grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. If permitting and market conditions line up, they could break ground by mid-2026 and deliver the first hydrogen before year’s end. Fingers crossed!

“We’re not just putting up another plant,” says Andrew Cottone. “We’re sketching out a blueprint for responsible, distributed hydrogen production. With partners like Siemens, Honeywell, MACH2, and our state champions, we’re carving a path toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system.”",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/resized-1759237769810.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 12:10:56.352042

Wainwright raised its price target on to $7.00 from $3.00 on Friday, while maintaining a Buy rating on the hydrogen fuel cell company. The stock has shown strong momentum, gaining over 130% in the past six months, though InvestingPro data indicates the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value.

The price target increase reflects rising electricity prices across the United States, with residential, commercial, and industrial electricity rates increasing by approximately 6.6%, 4.8%, and 5.1% respectively over the past year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. While Plug Power maintains a moderate debt level with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59, InvestingPro analysis reveals the company faces profitability challenges with negative gross margins.

Some regions have experienced even steeper increases, with Maine seeing a 36.3% rise, Connecticut 18.4%, and Indiana 11.5% in electricity costs, driven by growing data center power demands and industrial electrification trends.

H.C. Wainwright noted that higher electricity prices could make green hydrogen increasingly price-competitive compared to traditional grey hydrogen, strengthening the case for adoption of Plug Power’s technology.

The firm also cited positive sentiment toward nuclear power, particularly small modular reactors, as potentially benefiting hydrogen adoption, with federal targets aiming for 35GW of new nuclear capacity by 2035 and approximately 200GW of additional capacity by 2050.

In other recent news, Plug Power Inc. announced the delivery of its first 10-megawatt GenEco™ electrolyzer array to Galp in Portugal, marking a significant step in creating Europe’s largest proton exchange membrane hydrogen electrolyzer project. This project is expected to produce up to 15,000 tons of renewable hydrogen annually by early 2026. Additionally, Plug Power has amended its at-the-market sales agreement to include Yorkville Securities as an additional sales agent, allowing the company to offer up to $1 billion of its common stock. The terms of this agreement remain largely unchanged aside from the addition of Yorkville Securities.

In operational developments, Plug Power reported record production levels at its Georgia green hydrogen facility, with 324 metric tons of green hydrogen produced in August 2025. Oppenheimer noted operational improvements at the company’s Georgia facility, highlighting successful execution of key initiatives.

New Mexico was one of 21 predominantly blue states in the DOE’s rescission of funding for 223 energy projects across 21 states, equaling $7.56 billion in already appropriated funding.

U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM) told KOB on Thursday that the companies are still on the hook to pay its contractors though, and this could lead to higher utility rates pushed onto consumers.

“They are contractually obligated to the people that they are buying batteries from wires, from poles from, and so they’re going to have to pay those contracts,” said Leger Fernandez. “They can’t just say, ‘Sorry.’ The only place that they can raise revenue is by raising rates.”

One of the most significant project losses impact the Navajo Nation, where the Navajo Transitional Energy Company was set to receive $6.6 million for a carbon capture system at the Four Corners Power Plant. The $13.1 million project would have tested full-scale CO2 reduction technology but is now scrapped.

In northern New Mexico, Kit Carson Electric Cooperative lost $15.4 million in federal support for a battery energy storage system aimed at improving grid resiliency, part of a $29.3 million investment. New Mexico’s largest utility company PNM also saw its $72.6 million virtual power plant project cut after the administration pulled $35.6 million in funding.

The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology was hit particularly hard. Its projects under the Department of Energy’s Fossil Energy Carbon Management office included a $42.7 million carbon storage hub in the San Juan Basin, methane emission mitigation technology, and direct air capture research — all of which lost federal backing.

Clean energy innovators were also affected.

Solar Dynamics lost $3 million for a solar thermal project designed to convert biosolids into fertilizer. Meanwhile, Albuquerque-based Pajarito Powder, LLC, which develops hydrogen fuel and catalyst technologies, saw two projects scrapped: a $10 million grant for oxygen evolution catalysts to supply the electrolyzer industry, and another $8.5 million project to expand catalyst material manufacturing.

“Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states was nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful.

Leger Fernandez echoed what Heinrich said.

“They have a signed agreement, a signed agreement,” she said. “Now, you would think that if you have a signed agreement with the United States, it would be worth its signature.”

Meanwhile, PNM sent a statement to KOB about the cuts:

“PNM is currently evaluating the energy project cuts that have occurred today,” wrote KOB Spokesperson Eric Chavez. “While these cuts could impact some technical enhancement projects, the company wants to ensure customers that the overall Grid Modernization Project that was approved by state regulators last year is still moving forward.

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone.","As the weather turns colder, millions of families are bracing for another season of high energy costs and, for many, the threat of going without heat. One truth is impossible to ignore: Energy is becoming a luxury.

In the last year, residential electricity prices have risen 6.5% nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since 2022, estimates place the overall increase closer to 13%. Natural gas, heating oil and propane prices remain volatile, and households that struggled to keep cool this summer are now worried about how to stay warm this winter.

This is not a regional issue. From New England families dependent on fuel oil, to Midwestern households facing record utility bills, to seniors on fixed incomes in the South, the crisis of energy poverty has gone mainstream. Families are making impossible choices: between groceries and heating, or medicine and electricity.

As the leader of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project, I’ve spent nearly a decade calling out this quiet emergency. I’ve testified before Congress five times. I’ve met parents who ration electricity, seniors who wear coats indoors, and students who can’t keep their laptops charged for school. For them, energy is neither affordable nor reliable; it’s a luxury.

Who is at fault? Greedy utility executives? Commodity traders? For the answer, look no further than your nearest elected official.

For years, government policy has pushed a one-sided energy transition. Coal and natural gas plants that once provided steady, affordable baseload power have been retired in droves. In Maryland, more than 3,800 megawatts of coal-fired power generation have been taken offline since 2012. Meanwhile, subsidies flow toward electric vehicles and energy-hungry data centers, all of which compete with families for the same kilowatts.

Utility executives and commodity traders keep the lights on. Government, too often, turns them off.

That’s why I’m urging Congress and state leaders to act: Protect access to affordable, reliable energy by ending policies that raise costs and leave vulnerable communities behind.

If we put customers and providers, rather than bureaucrats, at the center of energy policy, the result will be lower bills, more growth opportunities, and greater financial freedom for families.

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone. It’s time for policymakers to wake up. It’s time to measure energy policy by human costs, not carbon counts. No parent should choose between feeding a child and heating a home. No student should fall behind because they can’t keep the lights on. And no American, not one, should be forced into poverty to survive the winter.

Let’s act as if energy matters. Because for millions, it’s the difference between hardship and hope.",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2025/10/Derrick-Hollie_Column.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 08:00:14.132689

U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 19 other Democrat-led jurisdictions in their August suit against the Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright, over attempts to cut funding for such projects.

Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal Energy Department. Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench — no written order had yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new department rule limiting “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — to 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown welcomed Kasubhai’s ruling. Maryland was one of the states on the suit.

“This ruling stops an unlawful policy by President Trump’s Energy Department that would have undermined Maryland’s efforts to meet climate goals and deliver a cleaner, healthier environment for our children and grandchildren,” Brown said Thursday in a prepared statement.

Officials with the departments of Energy and Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Besides Maryland and Oregon, others signed on to the suit were the District of Columbia and the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.

Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.","This story was originally published by Grist and is republished here with permission. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets—even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.

The battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure—roads, highways, parking lots—that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing—and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars—providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?

Cities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said.

The promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said.

In addition to that lowering of carbon emissions—how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent—there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires produce more microplastics—though their brakes produce much less dust—that sully the air and wash out to sea.

Drivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedaling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”

You can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes.

Put another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.”

Indeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.)

Established cycling havens like the Netherlands—where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter—show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather—there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”

The challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive—anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount—putting them out of reach of the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they can travel farther, and often more conveniently. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true if they’re living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty.

The solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asks. “It just seems bananas to me.”

In fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.)

Indeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Experts say cities could also start to think about bike share programs as an extension of their public transportation system. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”

Cities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure.

Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road—and drivers know how to handle bikers—is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.

Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted say that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining–and, potentially, widening–bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America.

“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories.

None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.

Now cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure—even high-quality, protected infrastructure—is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”

The committee is also asking for a capital subsidy scheme, since building 1 MW of solar power costs between Rs 4 and 7 crore.
“If these reforms are implemented, Punjab can become a renewable energy leader in North India,” Sharma said.","The Punjab government’s Renewable Energy Sector Committee is preparing to present a detailed plan to speed up the state’s clean energy transition. The committee will soon meet industry minister Sanjeev Arora to share its recommendations.

Pankaj Sharma, president of the Association of Trade and Industries Undertakings (ATIU), said Punjab must declare renewable energy as a priority sector to stay competitive.

He explained that many industrialists are setting up solar projects in states like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, where they sell power at Rs 3 per unit, but then have to buy it back in Punjab at Rs 9–10 per unit. A new land policy for solar parks and open access to power could make Punjab more attractive for investment, he added.

The committee is also asking for a capital subsidy scheme, since building 1 MW of solar power costs between Rs 4 and 7 crore. Punjab has an estimated potential of 5–6 GW, which would require Rs 20,000–35,000 crore in investment. Local solar manufacturing clusters have also been suggested to cut dependence on imports and create jobs.

Other proposals include raising rooftop solar limits for industries, easier transfer of security deposits when factories change hands, and building small hydro plants along Punjab’s canals to generate low-cost clean energy while creating rural jobs.

Currently, Punjab has just 1.2 GW of solar capacity, far behind states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. Committee members stressed that with nearly 300 sunny days a year, Punjab can do much better. “If these reforms are implemented, Punjab can become a renewable energy leader in North India,” Sharma said.

Clean-energy advocates have assailed the company’s new “Carbon Plan” update, saying it commits the state to old-school polluting technologies or unproven designs that could cost rate-payers billions of dollars while better, cheaper options are available.

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president, said in a statement accompanying the plan’s release this week. “By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.”

Public interest groups including NCWarn, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar and the Southern Environmental Law Center say the plan ultimately would result in higher bills for customers and make it harder for North Carolina to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

“Today, Duke Energy published yet another plan that lets North Carolinians down,” said Jake Duncan, the southeast senior regulatory director for Vote Solar. “This is the third Carbon Plan that fails to meet the moment. Instead of investing enough in low-cost, fuel-free distributed clean energy resources like solar that strengthens communities and lowers bills, Duke is doubling down on massive new methane gas plants and delaying coal retirements. The result will be higher costs for families, more pollution in local communities, and a worsening climate crisis.”

The burning of fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil generates carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration show that global warming is resulting in the loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer and more intense heat waves.

What is a Carbon Plan?

The Carbon Plan, also called the Resource Plan, is released every two years and updated each year in between to help North Carolina politicians, regulators and residents understand how Duke Energy — a regulated monopoly — plans to handle the state’s power demands.

The plan must be approved by the N.C. Utilities Commission, which tries to balance the need for enough power-generating capacity to attract and keep industry without putting rate-payers on the hook for building more power plants than needed or ones that don’t function properly.

The Carbon Plan is expected to be under especially close scrutiny by watchdog groups since North Carolina legislators approved Senate Bill 266 in July, overriding Gov. Josh Stein’s veto and allowing Duke Energy to charge customers in advance for power plants, before they’re built or brought online.

This method of financing, called Construction While in Progress, saves the utility, and by extension its customers, interest that would be charged on borrowed construction funds. But in other states it has resulted in rate-payers funding plants that were never completed or came in late and far over budget.

The bill also allows Duke Energy to miss a goal of a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, which the company had agreed to but now says is unattainable.

The utility still is supposed to reach carbon neutrality — meaning that for every ton of carbon dioxide its plants produce, an equivalent amount of emissions is prevented — by 2050.

What’s new in the 2025 Carbon Plan?

In its release, Duke Energy, said its most recent calculations, the raw data for which are not made public, reflect “rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.”

“Across the Carolinas,” the release said, “customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.”

To meet that need, Duke Energy proposes:

New nuclear-powered plants, including a large light-water reactor and/or small modular reactors, which would not come online until 2037 at the earliest.

The five new gas-powered plants it proposed in 2023 plus two additional combustion turbines for peak needs and additional storage for liquified natural gas to enhance reliability and guard against price volatility.

The plan includes some solar development and would increase battery storage capacity. It says that wind is “not an economically viable resource” for North Carolina customers through 2040 but says that will be reassessed at the next plan update.

The plan also calls for “maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators,” while extending the life of Duke’s coal-fired plants, citing the Trump administration’s plans to ease restrictions on coal.

The Environmental Protection Agency has said it wants to delay Biden-era restrictions on coal plants’ release of pollutants such as mercury and arsenic into waterways. The agency also wants to open up more than 13 million acres of now-protected federal land to coal leases, mostly in western states.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy also announced this week it will spend $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry,” more than half of it on recommissioning and retrofitting coal-fired power plants. The administration has said coal is needed to power the data centers that support AI.

North Carolina is home to 95 data centers, according to the tracking site datacentermap.com, with 39 clustered around the Charlotte area and 16 total in Raleigh and Durham.

The Energy Department also announced this week it’s canceling $7.56 billion in funding for 223 projects in the research and deployment of clean energy and other climate-friendly technology across the country but mainly in Democrat-led states, the Washington Post reported. That’s in addition to billions of dollars in earlier cuts to programs supporting green technology and renewable energy sources, and a proposal to rescind regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

Environmental groups question Duke Energy’s math

At the inaugural meeting this week of Gov. Stein’s N.C. Energy Policy Task Force, delegates heard from experts around the country about the importance of reliable, affordable and safe energy sources. They also heard that estimating future electrical demands is tricky, because the main drivers — growth in manufacturing, data centers and population — are hard to predict.

Even after a manufacturing plant has broken ground, plans can change; Vietnamese carmaker VinFast now says its Chatham County facility won’t open until 2028.

Watchdog and environmental groups such as the Sierra Club say that because Duke Energy gets paid a premium on construction costs, the company maximizes profits by building big centralized power plants that rely on polluting technology other utilities and countries are trying to phase out.

“Duke is a monopoly utility that has shareholders and they are guaranteed a rate of return on things that they build, so there is incentive for them to build things,” said Mikaela Curry, manager of the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign.

But what’s good for a company’s profits “is not always good for the families and rate-payers of North Carolina.”

Jim Warren, executive director of NC Warn, said Duke Energy also has an incentive to overestimate the amount of electricity that will be needed in the future to justify additional construction, the cost of which is passed on to rate-payers. NC Warn has challenged Duke Energy in the past over plans to add nuclear reactors at its Shearon Harris plant in New Hill, southwest of Raleigh.

Duke’s new resource plan “continues the horrible record of one of the world’s worst climate polluters,” Warren said. “Duke proposes to greatly increase methane gas for power and experimental nuclear plants while extending its burning of coal for at least 15 years. The plan slashes projections for large-scale solar and continues its suppression of rooftop solar. This would put billions into the rate system, leading power bills to double or triple over time while driving even more weather disasters that are devastating North Carolina communities.

“We call on Governor Stein and other state leaders to denounce and rein in this out-of-control corporate monopoly.”

Warren said that even if Duke’s estimates about rapid future growth in manufacturing pan out, the utility and state legislators could create incentives for companies to install solar collection and battery systems that would reduce strain on the electrical grid and provide some security against outages.

“Solar is the cheapest form of electricity ever created,” Warren said. Especially in cases where the state offers incentives for companies to locate here, Warren said, “There should be a requirement that these places use some of their investment up front to make their facilities as self-generating as possible in terms of their energy use. Why wouldn’t you? You have all these huge buildings and the roofs and walls and parking areas are empty. We should be having solar and storage put on all these places.”

What happens next with the Carbon Plan?

The N.C. Utilities Commission will schedule a public comment period and hearings on the Carbon Plan and issue and order on the plan by Dec. 31, 2026.

Fleets of batteries are now performing like gas plants, virtual power plants are dispatched daily, and hyperscalers are supporting new models to finance capacity around their data centers.

But investor-owned utilities? The Edison Electric Institute says they’re planning more than a trillion dollars in new infrastructure over the next decade to support historic load growth — with no mention of DERs or flexibility as solutions.

So which world are we living in? The one where DERs become essential infrastructure, or the one where they remain a rounding error for utilities?

This week, we examine this critical moment for distributed resources. Tim Hade, a co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure and former COO of Scale Microgrids, joins us to talk about the tug-of-war at the heart of the grid transition.

We unpack a recent historical overview of DERs from Andy Lubershane, who argues that technical innovation and the desperate rush to meet load growth is turning them from nice-to-have experiments into distributed capacity resources that grid operators can actually count on.

We also dig into EEI’s new report on utility planning, and examine why utilities still resist DERs even as customers and data centers push them forward. What are the consequences of ignoring them at this precarious moment when power prices are rising quickly?

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: It’s pretty wild that we’ve been recording together long enough that Tim is back on the show after almost a decade. Tim, how’s the last decade gone for you?

Tim Hade: Oh, wow. Well, hey, listen, first things first, I think this should be the cold open. I want to say this, I’m so grateful to be here today, and as I’ve told you many times privately, this show and its predecessor show has had such a profound impact on me professionally and I’ve learned so much from you all over the years, and I’m very grateful to Jigar for his service but I’m also happy he’s returned from his sabbatical and is back to being a ruthless capitalist. So, that’s good.

Jigar Shah: We’re definitely going to cut that statement out.

Stephen Lacey: He’s trying to butter you up, Jigar. He’s wearing a shirt that says, “Deploy,” with Jigar’s face on it.

Tim Hade: That is true.

Katherine Hamilton: You don’t realize this is a hostage video.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, are DERs about to become essential infrastructure or will they stay stuck at the margins? Distributed resources have never looked stronger, for the first time fleets of batteries are performing like gas plants, virtual power plants are getting dispatched every day, and data centers are seeing them as a real capacity resource. But at the same time, the gatekeepers, utilities, regulators, even officials in California are acting like they’re still optional. Utilities are planning well over a trillion dollars of infrastructure in the next few years, but they still aren’t prioritizing DERs. So, are these resources about to finally break through or get sidelined again?

Welcome to the show, I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the executive editor at Latitude Media. I am here as always with Jigar Shah and Katherine Hamilton. Katherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey Katherine.

Katherine Hamilton: Good morning. I’m so excited to do this with one of our best friends.

Stephen Lacey: Yes. And Tim is an advisor for 38 North Solutions. Is that right?

Tim Hade: Senior advisor, thank you very much.

Katherine Hamilton: Does that just mean you’re old? What does that mean?

Stephen Lacey: What differentiates between advisor and senior advisor?

Jigar Shah: You have to be on the Energy Gang at least twice, or now Open Circuit to be able to be called a senior advisor.

Tim Hade: That’s it, that’s right. That’s right.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar is the co-founder of Multiplier, and the former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. How’s it going, Jigar?

Jigar Shah: Oh, fantastic.

Stephen Lacey: Excellent. Well, joining us is Tim Hade, the voice you heard. He’s the co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure. Tim was also the co-founder and COO of Scale Microgrids, which he recently departed after the company was acquired this year, and he is a well-known DER evangelist and entrepreneur in the space. Tim, welcome.

Tim Hade: Thank you all so much for having me, I’m stoked to be here.

Stephen Lacey: I want to start with a little story that you told that last year’s DERVOS conference. I was not at the show but I watched the video afterward, and what some people might not know is that you were an officer in the Air Force, and in your keynote you relayed this story from when you were in the Air Force, that you heard when you were in the Air Force, about FDR and Henry Ford during World War II. And I think it’s a great story that maybe sets the stakes for what we’re talking about today. Tell us that story quickly and what it says about the moment.

Tim Hade: So, I guess first of all, this is a great opportunity to plug the upcoming DERVOS conference, that this year is being co-sponsored by yours truly, Jigar Shah. October 16th I think there’s still a limited number of tickets available, and if you care about DERs that’s the place to be. With due respect to the Latitude Media conferences, that is my favorite conference of the year.

Jigar Shah: I think you got that wrong, Tim. The advertisement should go like Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

Tim Hade: 100%. But yeah, look, I think the main point that I was talking about last year, and DERVOS last year was shortly before the election, was that in order for the United States to lead the energy transition and address the climate crisis, we really needed a public-private partnership. And the story that you mentioned was basically in the lead-up to World War II the German ambassador came to the White House and was basically like, “We build more bombers than the United States and don’t mess around.” And FDR sat there and listened, and then the German ambassador left the White House. FDR got on a plane, flew to Detroit, met with Henry Ford, who he didn’t like and they didn’t have the same sort of political leanings, and hadn’t talked in like 20 years, and they made this deal. And then, shortly thereafter, the Willow Run plant in the Ford Motor Company’s Willow Run plant was producing more bombers a day than the entire country of Germany.

And the thesis of my talk was that if we’re going to do this it has to be a public-private partnership. And then the election happened. And so, I don’t know, candidly this year has been a journey for me, because I think my view on this is the sad reality of the situation is that we’re not going to have that type of public-private partnership for the foreseeable future. So, now we’re in a position where my view is the U.S. energy transition is going to be private sector led, private sector enabled. And look, I think the good news about that is I know how to make people money, and our industry knows how to make people money. And so, I think there’s still a path and it’s not the path that I would’ve chosen, but I think we as an industry are resilient, and the leaders in this space are figuring things out, and figuring out how to pivot and move and adapt to this new environment.

And look, I think there’s a lot of reason for optimism. There’s headwinds that we’re facing, for sure, but there are also a lot of tailwinds, and I think we’re going to have a big next few years and we’ll see what happens.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I loved that story, and I think that’s a really important take on what’s happening now. So, we brought you here because it couldn’t really be a better time to talk about what’s happening in DERs right now. There’s a really interesting conversation going on about the role of distributed energy resources. I mean, this is a conversation we’ve had for 10 years or more, but there is a bunch of stuff that’s happening that I think makes it important to revisit this conversation explicitly. So, I think it’s really well framed out in a couple of pieces of writing that show the two ends of the spectrum. So Andy Lubershane, who is a partner and head of research at Energy Impact Partners, recently published this stellar piece on his Substack called Steel for Fuel. And his argument is basically that DERs have always been the right idea, but they were the right idea at the wrong time.

And 10 years ago when you were on the show with us previously, Tim, at that time the grid didn’t need them as much. They were still fairly expensive, but now everything has flipped. Demand from data centers, extreme weather, transmission bottlenecks, have utilities desperate for capacity, while of course batteries and other tech have gotten a lot more cheap and reliable. And he says that DERs are now turning into distributed capacity resources with this on off switch that grid operators can actually count on like real power plants. So, there’s a great interview with him on the September 18th edition of Catalyst, it’s a really superb breakdown of the history and evolution. But then when you go to the latest financial review from the Edison Electric Institute, which is basically a snapshot of where the money is going in the utility sector, it’s like DERs don’t exist at all. And the headline number is staggering.

Utilities plan to spend more than a trillion dollars this decade, the biggest investment wave in their history. And when you look closer, almost all of that is going into concrete and steel transmission lines, substations, plants, utility-owned storage, and what you don’t see in that document at all are virtual power plants, customer-sided batteries, flexible loads. So, I think this gets to the tension of what we’re going to talk about today, are living in a world where DERs are finally becoming essential infrastructure? Is the moment now? Or in EEI’s world where there’s still a rounding error. Katherine, which do you think is more representative of reality?

Katherine Hamilton: So, I’m going to go in the way back machine because Andy’s not been alive as long as I have, to when I was working for utility and I was designing systems for grids there, and DERs were absolutely crucial. And the reason was that load was growing, faster than we could manage it. And we had plenty of supply side, we had a nuke, we had pump storage, but we did not have enough substations. So, to buy us time to building substations, this was really on the distributed side, we had TOU rates, we had thermal energy storage rates. I was learning how to design ice systems for schools and hospitals. We had demand response programs, very sophisticated. This is the late 1980s, early 1990s. And what is consistent with that and what we’re facing right now is the utility.

The utility got to decide, “We need this, this is what we’re going to do.” They know how to do this. And the reason, Andy makes some great points about why things have or haven’t moved forward, but I think consistently it has to do with the utility and whether the utility wants it, and needs it, and is willing to monetize it or not.

Stephen Lacey: So Jigar, when you look at EEI’s report and you see almost no mention of distributed resources, and then you look at all the activity that we’re going to talk about on the show, what do you make of those two very different realities?

Jigar Shah: Oh, this is going to be fun.

Stephen Lacey: Meaning what?

Jigar Shah: You have a New Jersey Governor’s race right now where electricity rates are a top three issue. When you talk to the head of the Republican Party in Virginia, he’s like, “I have never seen energy be a number one issue in a gubernatorial race.” Like it’s on. The notion that utilities can just raise rates indiscriminately by 10% a year, that these utility CEOs who are basically just glorified head of a regulatory commission, they should get paid exactly what the head of the airport authority, or the water and sewer authority, or the transit authority get paid. But no, these guys think that they’re worth $26 million a year and they’re going to basically put one in six people in their territory such that they can’t afford electricity bills? The buzzsaw that’s coming for them right now is sharp, and it is going to cut right through them. I am very worried about the utility monopoly franchise itself. That’s how pissed off everybody is right now.

Stephen Lacey: There was this time around the 2015, 2016 timeframe when everyone was talking about the utility death spiral, and Andy points this out in that piece of history. Do you think we’re-

Jigar Shah: We’re still there.

Stephen Lacey: Do you think we’re overselling it?

Jigar Shah: No, we’re still there. I just want to make sure that people understand that in California, SoCal Gas has put forward a proposal to the Public Service Commission that says that they want to take all industrial clusters in California off grid based on Duncan’s paper. So, they’re just going to make it solar plus battery storage plus simple cycle gas plants-

Stephen Lacey: When you say Duncan’s paper, you’re talking about his solar microgrids paper that we talked about a couple months ago.

Katherine Hamilton: Duncan Campbell.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. So, Duncan Campbell at Scale. So, now you’re at a place where the gas company is saying that they want to eviscerate the sales of the electric utility company in a formal filing with the Public Service Commission because they believe that doing this de novo would give you 11 cent per kilowatt-hour rates for industrial clusters. I don’t think people understand that the death spiral is real. The death spiral is defined by if people believe that they can generate their own power instead of being part of a system that supports each other, which is what I support, to be clear, I don’t want a death spiral. I want people to be part of a greater system of resiliency, but at some point you give people no choice.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and remember, the reason we didn’t have the utility death spiral per se was because utilities are very organized, and they figured out a way to try to make money and to keep DERs completely out of the market. So they said, “All right, we’re not going to interconnect anything, and we’re going to not compensate anybody for anything, and we’re going to make aggregation of resources illegal. We’re going to do that.” In 16 states they were simply made illegal. So, they have been the ones who have been putting barriers up all along and now all of a sudden they’re like, “Oh, we need to raise our rates.” So, it’s really the ISOs fault, not our own fault that this is happening. But the utilities are very, very organized about this and they’ve been consistent, their messaging has been strong. And you can see, as you referenced, Stephen, in the EEI report, they’re all in lockstep.

Stephen Lacey: Tim, what did you make of Andy Lubershane’s thesis? I know you read it and it was resonating with you. What do you think he got right about the history, and to Katherine’s point, the role of utilities in delaying the deployment of DERs?

Tim Hade: Yeah, so I mean, I guess to begin with, I think Andy’s brilliant and he’s one of the best people I have ever met at synthesizing complex ideas. And so, I would encourage everyone to go read his piece that was put up on LinkedIn a few weeks ago. But look, I think the thing that I would maybe branch off from Andy on is I think he is very conservative with respect to how he talks about the macro situation. And so look, to put it simply I think the U.S. electric grid sucks. And before I get a bunch of emails from retired utility CEOs, look, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave us a D plus this year on the electric grid. I think the World Economic Forum ranked America as having the 19th best electricity system. So, I remember when I was a kid and we were like, “America’s number 19,” and celebrated.

We’re in a situation now where one in five, one in six Americans can’t afford to pay their electricity bills. There’s really nothing that’s happening that gives me any confidence that electric rates are going to come back down to earth or rate inflation is going to come back down to earth. So Brian Deese, who I think was on the show a few months ago, wrote a piece in foreign affairs calling this an electricity crisis. Certainly in the state I live, in in California, the word electricity crisis is thrown around quite regularly. And so listen, I think what we’re watching play out in real time is the electricity system is failing. And so, what I think utilities generally miss about this moment is they don’t have a choice on DER’s. DER’s are inevitable, what we’re talking about is the timeframe. And so, one of two things is going to happen.

Utilities are either going to use DER’s to prevent the electric grid from failing, or the electric grid is going to fail and then people are going to deploy DER’s. And either way, DER’s are going to get deployed. And so, I think to Jigar’s point, what a lot of people in our industry are trying to work on right now is preventing failure from happening. Let’s try to get ahead of this as much as we can and make good things happen before people have to pay the price. But look, I don’t think that’s happening fast enough. The one thing I’ll say is that, and I know you guys make this distinction all the time on the show, it’s hard to talk about utilities as a monolith. And so, the EEI has their perspective on things, but there are good utilities out there that are Incorporating DER’s into their integrated resource planning and things like that.

And I think what you’re seeing is that the utilities that are leading on that front are generally providing a better service to their customers than utilities that aren’t. And so again, I think generally speaking this is heading in the right direction, but it’s not happening fast enough, and if we don’t pick up the pace we’re going to see big consequences. And again, I think you guys talked to Charles about this the other week, and I listened, and thought he had some really good points about this, but ultimately people care about electricity. This is the most important thing that’s the foundation of the future of our economic growth. And when that system fails, people are going to care about it. And so, the question is when do we get to the point where normal people start to really care about this? And to Jigar’s point, I think we’re getting there.

This is a big thing in New Jersey, this is a big thing in Virginia, this is a big thing in California. Normal people who aren’t part of the electricity industry who don’t own Jigar Shah paraphernalia are really starting to care about this. And just walking around town in Santa Barbara, people come up to me all the time and ask me, “Why is my electric bill $600 a month when it was $300 a month four years ago?” Or, “Hey, what happened in LA? Can that happen here? I don’t feel safe when the wind blows,” and things like that. This is becoming a kitchen table issue, and I think things like what Katherine’s doing at Common Charge and a lot of other initiatives in the country are coming together to give people a voice. And so look, I think ultimately the message to utilities is you don’t have a choice about this. Either get on board or the electric grid is going to fail and then you’ll get on board afterwards. And I hope we can avoid that.

Katherine Hamilton: To speak a little bit to common charge, Tim, you’re totally right. We did just a soft launch and I had so much outreach from small businesses, from homeowners, from people of all walks of life, all regions of the country saying, “This is a major issue for you.” And we really are at this acute point where we have to start dealing with affordability and with reliability. And that’s where all of this conversation about DERs, which Andy talks about so well, really comes to the fore.

Jigar Shah: Can I say it maybe a slightly different way, which is that we were at roughly 60% asset utilization as a country for the assets that the utility operates in 2000, 2001. Today we’re at 40% asset utilization. So, that means that we have built a lot of stuff and not enough kilowatt-hours are going through that stuff. And so, every kilowatt-hour that goes through it has to pay more to pay for it. And so, we are in a magical place right now with load growth where we can resolve that situation, get back to 60% utilization by 2030, but the only way to do that is to take the EEI report and say, “Half of that is necessary maintenance, need to do it, stuff is old, it has to be replaced. And half of that is optional.” And the optional stuff can be better served at 90% discount to what you were going to do with DERs.

That’s the moment we’re in right now. And if you fail to meet the moment because you insist on investing a trillion or $1.1 trillion, then you’re going to make electricity so unaffordable that the DERs are going to be the cheapest way for people to serve themselves. And so, that I think is what’s in front of us. And I would say that as someone who has talked to the vast majority of CEOs and CFOs of the electric utility industry in 2024, given the energy and infrastructure reinvestment program that I was running for a loan programs office, I’d say almost all of them get it, but their middle management is fighting at tooth and nail. Their public policy people are fighting at tooth and nail, old habits die hard. I don’t think that the CEOs and CFOs are the ones that are not on board, because Wall Street has already told them that, “We’re worried about your Monopoly franchise. We’re worried that governors are going to go to extreme measures to make sure that this gets solved politically.”

Stephen Lacey: So, let’s talk about some of those potential consequences. You talked about the potential disconnection of industrial loads, you talk about it forcing more deployment of distributed resources, creating more competition. You talked about potential political outcomes, threatening the business model of the utility. Unpack which of those you think is the biggest threat for utilities right now if they don’t embrace this suite of solutions. It feels like we’re talking a very different language, by the way. You read the EEI report, they’re just in a completely different world and they’re really psyched about all this load growth because they’re going to build a lot more stuff. But talk about the potential consequences. Which of those you think are most acute if they continue to ignore them, these resources?

Jigar Shah: So I mean, I think we should balance the conversation from within the PJM Governors’ conference that happened last Monday. And so, you’re in a place where all these governors went on stage led by Shapiro, but then you had Wes Moore and Governor Youngkin from Virginia, et cetera, and they basically issued a veil threat that they’re going to leave the PJM. And the reason that they did that is because they believe that their populous wants them to be tough against the PJM. Make no mistake that it’s the dumbest idea ever to leave the PJM. It is so much better for everybody that we’re sharing power between Illinois and Virginia, so let’s just be clear. Then you follow up with all of these super smart people, some not so smart, that work for the governor. And you say, “What are your list of demands, right? You’ve issued a veil threat, what is it that you want the PJM to do differently?”

Zero demands. Not just bad demands, zero demands. So Shapiro made earlier demands, which is that we want to cap the capacity auction results, we want create a tighter window within which they operate. But if you ask them, “Have you demanded that the PJM implement FERC Order 2222? Have you demanded that they do grid enhancing technologies to expand the amount of capacity in the current grid that they’re operating? Do you actually want them to implement, connect and manage like we have in Texas so you can bring new assets on board faster?” So, you’re not guaranteeing them transmission capacity, you’re just guaranteeing that the new asset is safe to add to the grid, and then if they get curtailed, they get curtailed. These are all things they could have demanded, but they don’t know enough to demand these things.

And then when you talk to their public service commission, their public service commission’s like, “Look, it’s not my job to micromanage the utility.” They’re supposed to submit a rate case, I’m supposed to review it, and sometimes I push back on certain things, which is what Marissa Gilbert was doing in Connecticut, and the utility hated her so much that they spread nasty stories about her and got her fired last week. And so, now the utility is going after their regulator, after the judge that is supposed to oversee them because they don’t like how they’re being regulated. And so, we are in a period of maximum discord. The governors don’t know what to ask for, the regulators are saying, “It’s not our job to micromanage the utilities,” and the utilities are in la-la land saying nothing is wrong.

Katherine Hamilton: Well, they also would love to blame the ISO too. They would love to say it’s not their fault that their rates are going up. Well, they’re causing us to have our rates go up. One of the things that Shapiro did demand was, and other states too, wanted to have more say on the PJM structure, the board. I mean, there’s something to be said about the ISOs and the way they function, and the way that they operate, which is the people who are members of the ISO, the companies that are members of the ISO, those are the supply side resources. Those are the resources on the grid so they’re the ones that have the say, not the homeowners and small businesses that are desperately trying to get into a VPP program to be bid into the market.

They just don’t have any power right now, so part of that is really a power structure that I could see having to be somehow rethought and reorganized. But being out of the market, as Jigar said, that would be really unhelpful to everyone, especially since Pennsylvania is a net exporter. Who’s going to buy their stuff if they’re not in a market?

Tim Hade: Yeah, I mean, just one of the things I think Jigar touched on that I think is really important for people to understand is I think people generally understand that state policy has a huge impact on energy markets. I think what’s been shocking to me over the past few years is how little the average state politician understands about the electricity system in general. And so, as an anecdote I was meeting with a fairly high ranking person in the California legislature a few weeks ago, and we were in the middle of talking about some complex electric grid issues. And she asked me, she was like, “Hey, can you just clarify the difference between the transmission and the distribution system for me real quick? I don’t really get that.” And I laughed, I thought it was a joke, but then I realized she was serious. And so, I explained it to her and we got where we needed to go.

But look, I think the thing people should understand about state assemblymen, and state senators, and legislators who are making a lot of these decisions is they have a lot on their plate. And I think until recently, electricity issues haven’t been at the top of the list in terms of things they’re worried about and things their constituents are worried about. And so, as we talked about in the beginning, that’s changing. And so, now these folks are learning about this stuff, and a lot of the rhetoric from utilities, and regulators, and ISOs, and RTOs, and all these folks about, “Hey, this isn’t possible to do, and we don’t know how to do this and we can’t do this,” people are getting smart about this stuff and they’re realizing that no, you actually can do it. There’s a ton of precedent for doing it.

Jigar in the loan programs office wrote this liftoff report, and this liftoff report, and this liftoff report, and it gives you all the information you need. And so, I think the difference between now and 10 years ago is that there’s a ton of evidence out there, and there’s a ton of credible work out there to show that a better way is possible. And so, I think we’re in this period right now where it’s just taking time to educate folks about what the solutions are, but those solutions are out there and people are going to find them. And so, I think that’s the case for optimism is that as this becomes a big issue and constituents care about it, and normal people care about it, and Charles keeps going on CBS and doing his thing, that’s right, that’s right. As people get educated about this, they’re going to demand a better product and I think we’re in the beginning stages of that happening. And the good news is there are better products out there.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I mean, I’ve talked to a lot of those legislators, as you know too, and I think what a lot of people have said to me is that basically the only way through this moment is through state legislatures. That what the utility CEOs and CFOs have said to me is that they’re never going to go to Wall Street on their own and say, “We’re going to deploy stuff that’s 90% cheaper.” That is never going to happen. And so, they’re like, “What we need you to do is to pass a law that forces us to do stuff that’s 90% cheaper, and then we can say there’s a law. I’m so sorry, but we have to comply with the law.” And the regulator’s like, “Yeah, once there’s a law and we have to implement it, well then we can implement a law. That’s something we can do.”

And the governors are like, “Yeah, we’re happy to think about putting that law into our package of bills in January 1st so that it’s more likely to get passed,” as opposed to it being some sort of grassroots bubbled up idea that then we’re being forced to sign this law. And so, you’re seeing a lot of governors talk about reaching out and saying, “Okay, I know I ignored you for the last four years, Jigar, but maybe we’ll think about writing a law together to put this forward,” which I’m excited about because I feel like we’re starting to get real traction from the governors and the legislators around actually putting a prescriptive set of solutions together.

Tim Hade: I don’t want people’s impression of this to be that my view is the DER industry is perfect and we’re batting 1,000, and we just need utilities to get out of our way and then everything will be great. One of the real problems we have as a DER industry is that I would say generally speaking we’re politically naive. And so I mean, you guys know all our friends who run these companies and they tend to be introverts who like sitting in front of AutoCAD and designing stuff, and doing weird things, and building cool projects and things like that. But again, the reality is, is that our future is going to be dictated at least in part by state legislators and state regulators. And to date, we as an industry haven’t done a really good job of investing and educating those people. And so, Jigar, and Tom Massie, and Katherine and all these people who are leaders in this industry have gone out and talked to so many companies about, “Hey, you need to put some money in the kitty so we can go and launch these programs, and educate folks and do things.”

And more times than not, people haven’t stepped up to the challenge. And so, there’s a price that you pay for this education, and we as an industry have to take that more seriously. And so, I think part of the problem is that people don’t know this stuff, and part of the problem is that we as an industry haven’t done a good job of teaching, and we have to get better at that, for sure.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, that is literally what you have devoted your career to. Does that reflect your reality?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, absolutely. Just so much education, and sometimes it feels like there’s so much on the other side of educating, the uneducating part of it, that it’s a hard battle to fight. I would say, I think we’re at a tipping point, which is what we’ve been talking about, that people are going to start demanding this stuff. They’re going to start saying, “You have to give us the keys, unlock the door so we can actually start participating and saving money, because we can’t afford to pay our bills.” And I would give an example, Jigar was talking about legislative initiatives, and I would just say there’s an interconnection technology company that was telling me the stories. It’s very simple, interconnection technology, very inexpensive, would be super easy for a customer to get either EV connection or solar connection. And they’ve done this, they’ve deployed it in multiple utility areas that have been open to it, but they recently went to two different utilities in two very different parts of the country.

And the utility each said individually the exact same language, “This is probably illegal so we can’t do it.” And it was like they had been given that phrase, just as they have been given the phrase cost shift, which is also ludicrous, to say, “This is illegal.” And this company said, “If all of this is outlawed, only the outlaws will have it,” and we need to make this legal. We need to not have a bunch of outlaws. But I’ll tell you what, they’re going to be. People are going to deploy DERs whether or not they’re given permission, we need to give them permission.

Stephen Lacey: One of the things that has changed is the comfort of certain utility teams in bringing these resources into the operations team. So, planning teams have gotten used to modeling a lot of solar on their grids, but it is only until recently that operations teams have been thinking about this stuff as delivered capacity. And so, I just wonder how significant you think that shift has been, and if these DERs are now turning into distributed capacity resources with batteries as a backbone, will that accelerate inside these historically skeptical operations teams inside utilities?

Tim Hade: Yes. Yeah, look, this is an important thing I think, for people to understand about the technical journey that we’ve been on is what’s happened in the battery energy storage industry over the past decade has been remarkable. And so, when I was starting Scale in 2015, I would talk to engineers all the time and I would say, “Hey, I want to build a solar storage microgrid.” And they would be like, “Storage doesn’t work, it’s not a real thing.” And now it’s a very, very, very real thing. Battery costs at the cellular level are down 40% year over year this year delivered CNI systems, which is what I spend a lot of time procuring, are down 20%. The economic value proposition of batteries as a capacity resource is an absolute no-brainer in a lot of areas of the country. It’s not everywhere, but it’s a lot of places.

And so again, I think at some point the math just gets so obvious that people can’t ignore it anymore. And I think we’re at that point, we’ve hit that tipping point where putting a Powerwall in your garage, or a Megapack outside your industrial facility is just an obvious economic value proposition for the end use customer. And so, that battery capacity is going to get deployed. And I think the real question is do we use that battery capacity intelligently to help improve the grid, or do we just let people do this sporadically on a case by case basis? And so, the thing I worry the most about in the DER industry is there are a lot of people who just think, “Let’s just let the electricity system continue to do what it’s doing. It’s going to fail, we have a better value proposition, we’ll come in and pick up the scraps.”

And I think really what that leads to is a very unjust system where Fortune 500 companies and rich people have solar panels on their roofs and batteries in their garages, and all that kind of stuff, and then people who don’t have the right credit score or enough money to put a down payment on a solar system are still paying the fixed cost of the grid. And we don’t want to live in that world. If you’ve ever been developing countries, that’s how it is in a lot of the developing world, and it sucks. And so again, I think the key for the folks that run the electric grid is this stuff is going to get deployed anyway, the question is how do you manage that deployment in a smart way so the benefits percolate across society and aren’t just concentrated in a certain sector of the economy?

Jigar Shah: Well, and the thing that I think is so important right now is that we have to understand that the utilities have a really rickety software system. They’re mostly on SAP and Oracle, which are really terrible. And so, the way Oracle has built themselves is they just bolt on companies that, they just buy companies and then they just have this bandaging system. And so as a result, the operations people can’t do the things we’re asking them to do. So, if you ask them to integrate smart meter data into their operations, they don’t know how to do that work. It’s not possible. The vast majority of utilities don’t have a DERMS platform by which to dispatch DERs. And so, the reason why Dana Guernsey at Voltus, or the folks at C-Power or others are doing such a good job is they’ve just created an entirely parallel effort.

So, every time they build a commercial system, they have their own metering system that’s revenue grade on that system that they pay for separately so they can actually settle their dispatch with the PJM or whatever it is, and they can respond to a signal, which is not cost-effective to do for residential. And so, the weird thing is in this moment is that the one technology that can solve all the utilities problems happen to be AI. What AI does for a living, I don’t believe in AGI and all this other crap, but it’s very obvious that what AI is, is 20,000 paralegals that you can get for 20 bucks a month. So, the utilities have enormous amounts of unstructured data by which they can’t make any decisions. AI can turn those data sets into decisionable data sets. That’s what ThinkLabs does, that’s what all these other groups do inside the utility.

So, when you think about the key to OpenAI being successful as a business, it’s actually having a real paying customer that is worth serving. Right now every time they serve them, they lose money every transaction, but this is a use case where they could make a crap load of money. And so, we’re in this moment where it’s, I don’t know what’s going to happen. Does the utility actually want to solve this problem, or do they not want to solve this problem? Because my experience is the distribution people at the utility are in the basement. They do not have nice views of the park, they don’t actually have the right floor. They’re like, “Where’s your office?” “Oh, we’re in the parking garage.” And so, in this moment everything the utility does is utility scale generation, upgraded transmission, upgraded distribution, serve the load. It is clearly way cheaper just to figure out how to serve the load at the distribution line. And all the tools are there now, all the tools are available. And Lord Almighty, is this going to be a cultural shift.

Tim Hade: This is actually one of the things I’m really excited about with the hyperscalers getting involved in this industry, because I think what Jigar said is 100% true, which is one of the problems with integrating DERs into utility systems is utility software is archaic in a lot of cases. And so, now all of a sudden you have this situation where the customers who care most about utilities fixing their situation are literally software engineers. And so, the utilities come to Amazon, or Google goes to the utility and they’re like, “Hey, we need X megawatts of capacity to be able to build our data center.” And the utility is like, “Oh, we can’t do that.” And Google’s like, “Well, why don’t you just put batteries all over the city and then we can do it?” And the utility is like, “Oh, we don’t have the software capability.” And Google’s like, “What are you talking about? We could fix that problem for you in eight seconds.”

And so, now you have these people who have deep understanding of what’s capable in a software world and AI enabled software world who are coming to the table and helping to solve these problems. And I think you’re starting to see a lot of really cool pilots that are partnerships between tech and utilities rolling out across the country. And I think those programs are going to be really successful, because now the tech companies who have the most resources to be able to upgrade utility software and address these problems have a seat at the table and a deep concern about this issue. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons for optimism. My bet is that utility distributed energy resource management software platforms are going to get a lot better over the next two, three years.

Katherine Hamilton: So the other piece of that, and Tim, I totally agree, and with Jigar as well about the software piece, is that that does not just affect the utility operation but also affects the ISO. And that’s part of what the disconnect is, is that with order 2222 in which DERs are supposed to be able to actually completely participate in the markets, it’s taking forever because of all these software updates, and it’s software updates that have to do with the bidding parameters, all the information and data that they need from all the DERs, what are the locational requirements? What are all the different nodes that they need to pull in? Metering and telemetry requirements. And all this coordination has to be done with the utility.

So, you have an issue with utility and the data that they have, which I would argue they have a ton of data, they just don’t know how to use it, and then conveying that and coordinating very closely with the ISO, that is the way DERs are going to become really unlocked is to actually be able to monetize those wholesale markets that will bring down, put downward pressure on prices that will go to everybody in the ISO and all of the customers in the utility side.

Stephen Lacey: Let’s go to a couple other stories here. I want to turn to California. We hinted at this story previously. California has historically been great at promoting DERs but awful at utilizing them. We’ve railed about this previously on the show, but it is now potentially defunding this VPP program called DSGS. Katherine, how much of a blow is this to the market in California?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, it’s ridiculous. It’s the demand side grid support program, and what it allowed was for existing assets, like not new stuff but existing distributed assets that were out there to be brought together in virtual power plants to really solve some of the most crucial issues, peak demand and other events on the grid. They were extremely successful, there were hundreds of thousands of customers participating, almost 550 megawatts brought to the grid in a way that was really, really effective. And it was companies like Sunrun and Tesla who knew how to do that and were able to monetize it. And what happened is that in the budget, they only have about 15 million left for this program and they need about 75 million to make it work. So, that’s been part of the issue.

They think they might be able to get a billion or compete for a billion out of the cap and trade fund in the reserve, but it is a blow because it’s a program that was actually working in solving some issues on the grid, and allowing customers to participate. And it was unlocking these resources that were sitting there not being as useful or effective for the grid as they could be. So, I’m sure Tim has a lot of stories about it too, but it seemed one of those things that’s a penny-

Jigar Shah: Penny wise.

Katherine Hamilton: Penny wise, dollar foolish.

Jigar Shah: I’m torn about this thing. The DSGS program basically is a program that’s designed to be the quintessential, “We are incompetent so this is what we’re going to do,” program. Because you can imagine the CCAs, the community choice aggregators, have to buy resource adequacy so they could pay for these batteries right now that they’ve already been geotagged and allocated here. You have this emergency load response program that they could get paid by, the California ISO could pay them under FERC Order 2222, but the California Public Service Commission has deliberately sandbagged that program by making the effective load carrying capacities that they calculate for the California ISO program impossibly low so that nobody can make money in that program. And so, you basically have all this dysfunction up and down the state of California, so they’re like, “Screw it, we’re not going to fix anything. Let’s just pay them through the DSGS program.”

And that bothers me to no end, because along the way we’re just goal plating everything in California. We continue to keep building out new distribution grids because we refuse to use DERs to make those grids run more efficiently. Some of the grids in California are down at 15% capacity utilization. At some point you’re like, “What are we doing?” And so, I’d like to actually solve the underlying problem, which is that the state of California has a CPUC which hates DERs, and the staff that work there, which by the way is 650 people on the electricity side, they’ve got 1,200 people with gas and everything else, largest public service commission in the entire United States thinks that what consumers want is dynamic pricing. So, they hate DERs and they hate aggregators. And they’re like, “What we need is to give people a different price every five minutes of the day, and make them check their app before they turn on their dishwasher.”

And I was like, “In what freaking world do you have a job? I don’t understand how you even are employed here.” And so, the DSGS’s program is fine, but it’s a bandaid to the fact that the state of California can’t figure out what Texas has done, and actually just integrate decision making for the DERs and how they get paid through a stacking of multiple different revenue streams from all these different things that they could do to make things more affordable in the state of California.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and they’ve hated demand response like forever, since the beginning of time they’ve hit a demand response. Like a very simple tool.

Tim Hade: Yeah, all right. So, I guess before I talk about the state of California, it’s probably worth noting that I live in the state of California. And-

Jigar Shah: Is Santa Barbara the state of California? It feels like its own little enclave.

Tim Hade: Some have called it a bubble. Look, I think one of the caveats is before I ever talk about the problems with the California energy system, I do think it’s important to note that California has done more than any state on climate leadership, and I don’t think it’s close. And so, if you think about the history of the solar industry, the wind industry, the battery industry, the EV industry, so much has been done in this state to move those technologies forward and a lot of other states are benefiting from the early work that was done in the state of California. With that said, California has the worst electric grid in the United States and it’s not close. And so, you look at any metric, reliability, resilience, price, it’s terrible. I think in my county of Santa Barbara, one in four people can’t afford their electricity bills, one in four households. So, it’s bad on a national basis, it’s worse in California.

Average retail rates here for residential customers in my area are like 35 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is, I don’t know, two and a half times the national average. And it’s like a safety issue. And so, again, I guess there’s still a court case going on, but potentially the electric grid burned down Pasadena. And so, I think we’re in this situation now where California is the Normandy for this issue nationally, where look, I think the average person I know in the state of California, part of the problem with this is it’s so confusing, and it’s complicated, and people don’t understand the difference between a kilowatt and a kilowatt-hour, and how does any of this stuff work? But what they know is that we’ve been listening to the same people in this state for 20 years, and the result is we have the worst electricity system in the country.

And so, now you have this whole other group of people on the sidelines who have been saying, “Hey, there’s a better way to do this,” over and over and over again, and being ignored. And I think normal people are just like, “Hey, let’s change direction.” And so look, I think the challenge with this is we talked about the education piece with the state legislature and the California Public Utility Commission, but look, ultimately from my view this is going to be a massive issue in the 2026 gubernatorial election. And I think in my mind there hasn’t been a governor who’s done a worse job on electricity policy than Gavin Newsom. And so, I think when we have this gubernatorial election, especially the Democratic primary, people are going to need to answer for that. And so, ultimately I think the gubernatorial candidates are going to have to get smart about this stuff in order to answer the questions people have about why is the system so bad.

And when they’re preparing for those questions, they’re going to find out that like, “Hey, there’s a lot of stuff that we can do to make this better that we’re just not doing because this person at the IBEW, or this person at XIOU doesn’t think it’s in their best interest for quarterly earnings,” or whatever the case might be. But this is going to come to a head, it’s coming to a head right now. And I think again, the good news is that we have a lot of companies in California, we have a lot of innovators in California. I think we’re going to get a shot to deploy this technology and show what it can do. And I think once we do that, people are going to find out we’re ready for this and we’re going to be able to build a better system. And so, part of the reason I live in California is because we have the worst electric grid in the country.

And again, you guys talked about this in terms of painkillers and vitamins, good electricity technology is a painkiller in California. And so, I think ultimately we’re going to get our shot on goal and we got to step up and meet the moment, and make sure we’re doing it the right way. I think once we do that, California is going to become a model for how you build the 21st century grid. At least that’s what I hope happens. And then, the rest of the country can steal our innovation again, and hopefully we land in a good place.

Stephen Lacey: Is there any lesson to take from California about how to fund these programs? So, we’ve learned throughout the history of solar in particular that these stop start programs are bad for the industry, we had early rebate programs that would sell out really quickly. How do you structure these programs so that you’re not at the whims of state politicians so that when they’re in this budget squeeze they don’t just strip funding out of your program? What’s a better way to fund these programs so that they’re market based and stacked appropriately?

Jigar Shah: Well, it depends on-

Tim Hade: Retail choice.

Jigar Shah: Look, I think it depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. So, obviously when you’re in the commercialization phase of a program, rebates and incentives are going to be critical because they’re clearly very expensive. I think the challenge you have in California is that that pivot to a market-based system is very hard when people get addicted to the rebates. So, when you look at Texas, Texas clearly was basically started as a market-based system. They had some wind mandates early on, but solar was really not allowed in Texas until it hit some sort of economic threshold, and then it was allowed to do as much as it wanted to do. And you’re starting to see the DER stuff because Texas unlocked a lot of the smart meter data early on, and is innovated in that area so that you could actually access a lot of the DER work. Whereas California has really been frustrated by entrenched interests.

I mean, you see with the NEM programs in California, we knew a long time ago that the net metering programs needed to be reformed in California, but they just had so much power that they were able to stave it off until they basically just went too far the other way, which is where you are now today. And so, I’m hopeful, and you see that when New York now, and New York has eviscerated the solar industry in New York and has not committed at all to doing any of the permitting reforms or other reforms that are required to cut the cost of doing business in the state of New York by half. And so, residential solar in Texas now is $1.90 a watt unsubsidized, and in New York it’s $4. And so, you’re in this weird spot where New York has not gotten the backlash that California got, but New York has done exactly the same thing to cut the legs out from underneath rooftop solar in that state.

And so, one of the big challenges that we have in front of us is as we commercialize these technologies, we have to figure out a really secure off-ramp for these subsidies as they get bigger and bigger, obviously as the technologies get deployed at more scale, and they get fully integrated into the way the utilities operate so you can get all the best benefits out of them.

Katherine Hamilton: Well, and you need open markets. So, the utilities in California fought against community solar to the point where it’s only going to be allowed by utilities, third parties can’t participate. And that’s where you get the benefits to customers is through third party programs because those third parties come in, they compete, they provide all of the benefits. Well, part of the benefits will go to themselves, but most of the benefits will go to the customer. Whereas of the utility, if they own it, it goes to the return on equity and to their shareholders. So, something has to also give in the utility, and maybe that’s through the legislature as you had mentioned earlier, Jigar, but we need to somehow break that so that we get the ability to have open and fair markets so customers and all of these DERs can actually participate.

Tim Hade: Yeah. And one other thing that I think is really problematic in California is the complexity of the market is mind-boggling. And so, almost no one understands how the electricity markets in California work. I’ll give you a distinct example. When I moved out here, I had to learn about resource adequacy, which is the capacity market in California. It cost me $150,000, something like that, in consulting fees to feel like I had a good understanding of the resource adequacy market, and I still don’t really understand it. And so, now I go out and I want to build a battery system, and I’m like, “Okay,” and my revenue streams are dependent on this abstract concept of a resource adequacy market. How do I think about how much money I’m going to make over the next 10 years? And it’s impossible to figure out. And by the way, trying to figure it out is dependent on do you think Diablo Canyon is going to get relicensed in 2032? That’s the underlying assumption in the model.

And so, none of these markets make sense to anyone. And so, ultimately you’re in this situation where you want to have utilities and the private sector working together to try to figure out how to deploy all these resources, and it’s really, really hard to do and no one understands what the market dynamics are. And I think honestly there’s some entrenched interests in Sacramento who like it that way, because there are six people in Sacramento who actually understand how this works, and that’s their competitive advantage. And so, when people like me want to understand it, I have to pay them a lot of money in order to explain it to me. But that’s not a good way to run a state electricity market. And so, I think ultimately one of the problems in California is like it’s way, way, way too complex.

We’re very, very good at writing laws, we’re not good at taking laws away. We’re very, very good at writing regulations, we’re not good at taking regulations away. And so, if you want to be an entrepreneur and into the electricity sector in California, I’ll print you out 100,000 pages of documents that you probably won’t understand anyway, and you have to read all those things and then guess. And so look, if you really want to create a vibrant market, people have to understand how that market works. And that’s a huge problem in California as people just don’t get it, and I’m one of those people.

Jigar Shah: Well, what’s so sad is that, as you know, we had that gathering of all those California companies a few months ago and they all basically said, “Yeah, we’re based here but we don’t do business here, and we’ll never do business here. So, we do business in Texas and Massachusetts, and all these other places, and we’re based here with our headquarters but we’ll never do business here.”

Stephen Lacey: That actually brings us nicely into something that you’ve been thinking a lot about, Tim, which is soft costs, the costs around permitting, customer acquisition, navigating the regulatory environment. That’s the stuff that hasn’t budged as hardware prices have fallen. And Tesla recently put out this report saying we could potentially lower residential soft costs by 40% with better automation. We’re seeing companies like Aurora Solar, 257 use AI to slash customer acquisition costs. And I know that this is something you’ve been looking into more. Why do you have soft costs on the brain?

Tim Hade: Yeah, so if you think about the problems with distributed energy, and there’s some stuff we own too, and I think Jigar wrote a LinkedIn post about this two or three weeks ago that’s really good and explains the issue in a very concrete way. The biggest problem with the distributed energy resources business model is soft costs. And so, if you think about a typical distributed energy resource project, it varies a little bit, whether it’s residential or commercial, what size of the commercial or whatever the case might be, 50% of the costs are not hardware installation. And so, the cost of putting solar on your roof in California, if you just look at hardware and installation is like two bucks a lot, something like that. The actual cost that the homeowner pays is four bucks a lot. And the difference between those two things is soft costs.

And we’ve known that as an industry for a long time, there just hasn’t been a clear solution. And then AI. And that’s the thing I’m most excited about with AI is AI is a really, really good way to reduce soft costs on these projects. And so, you think about the primary drivers of soft costs, legal, legal and contracting. Jigar mentioned it, it’s a lot easier for me to write a contract today than it was three years ago. Financial modeling, energy modeling, engineering, one line diagrams and things like that. Permitting. The town of Bakersfield, which isn’t considered one of the most innovative places in the state of California, just implemented AI the other week that allows you to get an instant permit to put solar on your roof or a battery on your property. All of these drivers of soft costs can basically be solved with AI.

And so, I think ultimately what you’re seeing is now we’re on this path where hardware costs are dropping, installation costs are going up a little bit, but soft costs are just being eviscerated. And I think in the distributed energy space, whoever wins on soft costs is going to win. So, you have a lot of innovative people in the space who are really taking this seriously and looking for every dollar, every cent that you can extract out of the installed cost of these projects, and how you can apply AI to these things, and the early results are phenomenal. I think Jigar was telling me he was talking to some companies that think they can reduce soft costs by 80% today by using sophisticated AI tools. I’ll take the over on that, I think in the work I’m doing, 30 to 50% is probably reasonable. But even then we just dropped the cost 30 to 50%. Then you’re in this environment where the hub of DERs moving forward is going to be batteries, and I think a pleasant surprise from the last year is that the battery ITC withstood the OBBB process.

And so, you didn’t even lose the battery tax credit, you lost the solar tax credit but you didn’t lose the battery tax credit. So, when you think about the installed cost of these systems, they’re plummeting at the same time retail rates are rising. And again, I think the industry in general is going to hit that tipping point where this stuff just becomes super obvious from an economic value proposition standpoint to off-takers. But then within the DER industry, the race right now is who can do the best job attacking soft costs? And I think there are a lot of people coming up with a lot of innovative solutions really, really quickly.

Stephen Lacey: I totally agree that this is one of the most important areas where AI can have an impact. And Jigar, I think I agree with your take earlier in the conversation. I share your skepticism around AGI, however the AI labs are defining that, but I think this is a very clear example where AI is very good at distilling data, synthesizing things, improving processes. I know to Tim’s point, you were writing about this, Jigar, I think you mentioned 257’s Pink platform that can cut acquisition costs by 33% for installers through automated outreach, prediction modeling. Aurora Solar has been using machine learning for years. How much are you seeing this actually impact soft costs now, Jigar?

Jigar Shah: Well, so EnergySage has put out these awesome reports every year, and certainly every quarter as well, and the last quarterly report they put out was right before RE+ and showed a huge decline actually in the average install cost of residential solar that it was tracking. I think it was like 14% or something. And so, one of the things that I did a lot at RE+ was just talk to a bunch of people when we put together events, and I’d say that something on the order of 20% of the industry is fully committed to this. They’re fully committed to hitting basically a $2 a watt benchmark residential system cost installation by the end of ’26. That’s going to change obviously, it’s $1.90 in Texas and maybe 2.45 a watt in Massachusetts, but they’re committed to whatever that equivalent number looks like for their region and their state, which is not nothing.

And I do think that the other people may not come along and they may all go out of business, and then the people who decided to do this will take up their market share. So, I think like most things in life in solar, the people who are willing to innovate and actually push the envelope are going to have much larger businesses, and the people who want to do things the exact same way they did last year will go out business, and the solar industry megawatts will still go up into the right. So, I think the industry is going to continue to deploy more technology and more panels and all that stuff as ever before. And unfortunately, you might have a bunch of people who go out of business because they decide that they don’t want to commit to the number of changes required to make this a reality.

But I do think in this moment you have 25% rate increases across the country the last four years, you have another 25% rate increases that are coming over the next four years. I mean, solar’s never been more cost-effective. And as Tim suggested, and Katherine has said multiple times, battery storage, I mean, is the bacon of the grid. And so, at some point people want more bacon.

Katherine Hamilton: Every single kind of distributed energy asset company should be using AI to squeeze every kind of efficiency out of their processes no matter what they are. I mean, the ones that do that are going to succeed and be more cost competitive than others. Definitely on the regulatory front I think it’s obviously going to be a little bit slower, it’s a higher risk environment, and I think that it’ll just take a little bit longer. But if you have the DER companies doing this and becoming very cost-effective, as long as the structures are enabling those to be unlocked and allowing customers to participate in a market, that’s going to be what’s needed. And then, hopefully we’ll be able to show the way to the regulators that, and to those who are, for example, processing permits and all of that, that has to be done on a local level, that we can kind of de-risk it so they can feel comfortable.

Jigar Shah: The one other thing that’s happening, which I think people are not paying enough attention to, is that people have gotten super smart about how to get around the regulations. So, like Carrier just announced that they’re putting a battery in their HVAC unit, and what that allows you to do is to just take away the ramp because when you’re turning on an air conditioner you have a huge amount of inflow current. And so, they get rid of that by having the battery. But magically, by having a battery in your HVAC system, there are no interconnection rules whatsoever or permitting requirements. And so, they control 100 gigawatts of HVAC load in the country. So, as all of those HVAC units are being replaced and they replace them with a battery in there, that’s 100 gigawatts worth of demand response that Carrier now controls.

Now look at Copper and what they’re doing in their induction stove. They’ve got a battery in there, there’s no permitting or interconnection requirements needed to put in a Copper stove. And guess what? I’m pretty sure next week someone’s going to come out with a battery inside their water heater. And when that happens, no permitting and interconnection requirements there either. And so, I just think this is going to be awesome.

Stephen Lacey: All right, guys, let’s round this out. So Tim, we talked to you almost 10 years ago. Hopefully we’ll have you on the show in less time than that, but let’s say we talk again in 10-

Tim Hade: I only do once a decade. Once a decade.

Jigar Shah: That’s in my contract, sir.

Stephen Lacey: So, we’re having this conversation in another decade, what is the optimistic scenario for DERs that you think could play out? Look, we were all feeling pretty optimistic about DERs 10 years ago, the utilities did everything they could to stall the transition. There wasn’t the same urgent need for these resources. We saw a lot of really interesting concepts developed but not deployed. So, 10 years from now are we going to be having a materially different conversation? We’ll go down the line with each of you.

Tim Hade: Look, I think what I know or what I deeply believe is that what we do in the electricity sector over the next decade is going to define America in a lot of different ways on a global stage over the course of my lifetime. And whether that’s from a climate perspective or a national security perspective, or a not losing the AI race to China perspective, which I guess is also national security, this stuff is really, really important. What I’m also convinced of is that the future of electricity systems will be wireless. We’re heading towards a world without wires. And the activity that I always ask people to go to when they tell me I’m crazy about that is just imagine the best possible version of the electricity grid. Why would we have wires? You would just have buildings that made their own power, and vehicles that made their own power and all this type of stuff, and you wouldn’t need thousands of miles of transmission lines, and distribution lines and all that kind of stuff.

And that’s going to happen. I don’t know whether that’s going to happen in 100 years, or 200 years, or 300 years, but the electricity system is 120 years old. We’re still in the infancy of this. And the idea that the way this currently works is going to be the way it works forever is preposterous. And so, you believe those two things that this is where America needs to lead on electricity innovation and the future is heading towards a more distributed electricity system, and we have a big role to play in that. And so look, I think to Andy’s point, Andy Lubershane’s point that we talked about with the time for DERs is now, I think if you look at this from an investor perspective and you look at the metrics, and you look at the cost curves and all this type of stuff, there’s a pretty good argument to make.

I think the big question is like, are we ready for this? We as an industry. And Jigar and Katherine, and some of the other leaders in our field, 10 years ago they were ready for that and we were not. The rank and file soldiers of the distributed energy movement were not. And now I think we are. I think we’re battle hardened and we have experience, and we understand how this shit works and we’re ready to go. And so yeah, I’m going to bet on us. And I think what you’re going to see in 10 years is that we’re going to be closer to having the number one electricity system in the world than the number 19 electricity system in the world. And I think that’s the beginning, we can continue to grow this thing and improve, and ultimately set the standard. Now again, I think there’s definitely headwinds in our way, but ultimately I’m going to bet on innovation over everything. And so, that’s where I hope we get to.

Katherine Hamilton: I love that, Tim, and I would just say Jigar was talking about how the DER folks have been stuck in basements. And remember, my examples are from the ’80s, and when I say ’80s I mean 1980s where we kept our files in the back of a funeral home, and we are going now to literally in 10 years I look at organizations like Common Charge and others as really being pathways to break down and heal some of the divisions that we have in our country now. I feel like we all want the same things. We all want to be able to have electricity, we all want power all the time, and this can bring us together. I think DERs will be a means of doing so. It’s been heartbreaking to see how clean energy has become political, and I’m hopeful that some of what we’re working on on the distributed side will start healing that.

Jigar Shah: Look, I thought it was impossible for us to pass SB 540, SB 541 and SB 254 this year of the California legislature. It took 10 years to get those things passed, so we are now allowing California to trade with the rest of its neighbors, which really wasn’t allowed before. We are now mandating VPPs and DERs in the state, and the CEC is going to lead it, the CPC is going to follow. Thank God Alice is leaving, and so we’ll be in a good shape there. And 254 basically helps to securitize $6 billion worth of PG&E debt, which starts to bring costs down. My sense is that we’re going to pass legislation like this in another six states next year because of the political tailwinds we have, and my sense is the environmental groups are all going to get on board. And so, when you think about all of the momentum that we had in the early 2000s around renewable portfolio standards, and how much coordination it took to pass those, we will have the exact same level of coordination over the next 10 years to pass consumer bills of rights across the entire country.

And those Consumer Bill of Rights will include DERs at the very top, grid enhancing technologies, connect and manage, some of these other things that are 90% cheaper than what the utility’s preferred route to do things are. And that is what is going to make for, as Tim said, a century where America continues to have a world beating, a world leading electricity system, which I know that the people who work in the electricity system want. I mean, everybody that I know that works in the electric utility industry is proud of what they do every day, and I’m proud of them and all the great work that they do every day, and I’m proud to be part of that broader industry. And I do think we have what it takes, but I do think we’re going to have to pass laws in all 50 states to really give the consumer the bill of rights that they deserve to be able to be protected in this moment.

Stephen Lacey: A great place to close. What an extraordinary moment it is. Tim Hade is the co-founder of Brightfield Infrastructure, he’s the former CO and co-founder of Scale Microgrids. Tim, this was awesome. Thank you so much.",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-02T164536.657.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-03 08:00:09.904266

“Colorado is proud to lead the nation in clean energy and consumers in our state continue to choose low cost renewable energy and clean, reliable technologies.","DENVER (KDVR) — Day two of the federal shutdown is winding down. While members of Congress are not set to vote on another proposal until Friday, President Donald Trump and his budget director are working on a plan to cut federal funding and jobs in blue states.

Colorado is set to see cuts.

The president’s budget director warned that since Wednesday, Colorado may lose some federal funding for clean energy programs. There is now a better idea of exactly what could be cut.

Coloradans push for enhanced premium tax credit extension amid government shutdown

Russell Vought is the U.S. Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He also helped write Project 2025. He met with President Trump on Thursday to determine which agencies he should cut.

The president said on social media that the two of them would determine if the cuts would be permanent or temporary; Trump called this an unprecedented opportunity. Vought said mass layoffs would likely happen Thursday or Friday, the president’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying thousands will likely be laid off from the federal workforce.

Vought also posted on X on Wednesday that nearly $8 billion in climate-related projects would be cancelled in 16 states, Colorado being the second on the list of all the states that went for Kamala Harris in 2024.

A list of the U.S. Department of Energy projects was shared with FOX31. There were 34 projects related to Colorado. While those projects did not have cost projections listed, they are believed to be worth more than $500 million in federal funding.

Among the institutions whose projects are facing cuts, Colorado State University, Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office were all listed multiple times.

Groups, leaders react to Colorado’s expected funding cuts

The Colorado Energy Office sent FOX31 an updated statement Thursday afternoon, saying their grants impacted by the cuts total to $5 million.

“Colorado is proud to lead the nation in clean energy and consumers in our state continue to choose low cost renewable energy and clean, reliable technologies. We cannot allow China to surpass our country in these sectors. While we have not formally received any official federal notices of termination, we understand that two Colorado projects that total $5 million are on DOE’s list, which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for President. This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community. The two Colorado Energy Office grants that are targeted on the list each provide $2.5 million to support reduced energy use and create cost savings through building energy codes and building performance standards that support decarbonization. These are just two of more than 30 grants totaling more than $500 million that are being illegally terminated in Colorado alone. Other terminated grants in Colorado range from oil and gas methane reduction projects and investments in grid resilience to support for utility programs in low-income communities.”

The Sierra Club:

“By cancelling more renewable energy projects, Donald Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans. These projects are stable, well-paying jobs, and crucial cost-savings for families. While families are already struggling with the high cost-of-living across the country, the administration is focused on playing political games and holding common sense projects hostage, leaving everyday Americans out to dry.”- Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp

Colorado’s congressional members:

“By cancelling more renewable energy projects, Donald Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans. These projects are stable, well-paying jobs, and crucial cost-savings for families. While families are already struggling with the high cost-of-living across the country, the administration is focused on playing political games and holding common sense projects hostage, leaving everyday Americans out to dry.” – Congressman Jason Crow, a Democrat representing Colorado’s 6th Congressional District

“The cancellation of this funding for political vengeance is blatantly illegal. Congress approved this funding to create jobs and to generate cleaner, cheaper power. Even if for some dark reason you are against cleaner energy, these projects are well underway. To abandon them now wastes the funds already invested, and needlessly cripples dozens of honest, hard-working small businesses that believed having a legal contract with our country meant something. The White House strategy during their shutdown is to punish Americans who dared to vote against them.”- Senator John Hickenlooper, a Democrat

FOX31 is still working to learn exactly which projects could be affected and how much funding they could lose. Decarbonization could be a central goal of many of the projects on the chopping block.

“Since then, national sales data have shown a noticeable uptick as consumers rush to purchase EVs while the credit is still available,” the report states.
The internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle market share declined 4.2 percentage points.
Hybrid EV market share increased by 4.7 percentage points, while ICE vehicle market share contracted by 4.2 percentage points, the report says.
Through Q2 2025, the number of publicly available EV chargers increased 12% from 2024, while total EVs on the road also increased 12%.","As of Q2 2025, there were 6.5 million electric vehicles (EVs) on U.S. roads, or 2.25% of vehicles in operation, which is a new high, and a total of 217,929 public charging outlets — a ratio of 30 EVs for every public port, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s “Get Connected Electric Vehicle Report Q2 2025.”

EVs represented 9.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales in the quarter, down by 9,000 units from 9.6% in Q1, and from 10.9% in Q4 2024.

The report summarizes EV sales and purchasing trends across all 50 states, breaking down light-duty market share by powertrain (2016-2025) in addition to a geographic distribution analysis of registered EVs, state-by-state charging infrastructure, and a look at EV battery recycling.

The report notes that federal EV policies have shifted since 2024, including the elimination of consumer EV tax credits after Sept. 30, 2025. The report is based on data trends that occurred just before the tax incentive elimination was signed into law at the beginning of Q3.

“Since then, national sales data have shown a noticeable uptick as consumers rush to purchase EVs while the credit is still available,” the report states. “Nevertheless, EVs remain an important part of the U.S. market, both in response to consumer demand and in the larger picture of U.S. global competitiveness.”

EV market share declined by 0.5 percentage points from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025; however, EV volume increased by 4%, or 29,000 units.

The internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle market share declined 4.2 percentage points.

According to the report, as of Q2, 155 EV, utility vehicle, pickup truck, and van models were sold in the U.S.:

Ninety-five battery electric vehicles — 26 cars, 52 utility vehicles, seven pickups, and 10 vans

Fifty-seven plug-in hybrid vehicles — 24 cars, 32 utility vehicles, and one van

Three fuel cell electric vehicles (including a plug-in hybrid fuel cell) — one car and two utility vehicles

Light truck sales represented 79% of the Q2 EV market, unchanged from Q1 2025. California (22.9%) and Colorado (20.5%) led the country for EV registrations.

Nine states and the District of Columbia had EV registrations above 10% in Q2 2025:

District of Columbia (17.4%)

Washington (16.9%)

Nevada (16.2%)

Oregon (13.8%)

New Jersey (12.8%)

Florida (10.5%)

Hawaii (10.2%)

Connecticut (10.1%)

Massachusetts (10.1%)

Michigan (10.1%)

U.S. EV registrations stood at 385,075 in Q2 — a 0.3% volume decrease, or about 2,000 units, compared to Q2 2024.

Year-over-year, total light-duty sales (all powertrains) increased 5%, or about 194,000 units. Hybrid EV market share increased by 4.7 percentage points, while ICE vehicle market share contracted by 4.2 percentage points, the report says.

Nearly 761,000 EVs were sold in the first half of 2025, making up 9.55% of all light vehicle sales, and a decreased market share of 0.1 percentage point from the first half of 2024.

Through Q2 2025, the number of publicly available EV chargers increased 12% from 2024, while total EVs on the road also increased 12%.

During the quarter, 9,424 new public chargers were added — a ratio of 41 new EVs for every new public port, the report says.

More than 1 million additional public chargers (906,670 L2 and 124,401 DC Fast) are required to meet the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s necessary infrastructure estimate for 2030, according to the report. That breaks down to 513 chargers installed per day, or nearly 3.6 chargers every 10 minutes, through the end of 2030.

“A circular economy for EV batteries — focused on recycling, reusing, and repurposing — offers a path to strengthen supply chains, improve affordability, and ensure sustainable growth,” the report states. “More than 80% of global recycling capacity is in China, compared with less than 2% in the U.S.”

China is forecast to account for 78% of battery pretreatment capacity and 89% of black mass refining capacity, as the demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite is projected to continue surging, according to the report.

In the next decade, it’s projected that more than 100 million vehicle batteries will reach end-of-life, which the report says will create “a massive pool of recoverable material.”

“Recycling and reuse could cut primary mineral demand by 12% by 2040,” the report states. “By 2040, recovered materials could supply more than half of the global demand for these critical minerals.”

Cost savings are estimated to reach as much as $25 billion annually.

Wikipedia: Carbon offsets and credits

Research from The Australia Institute has suggested that at least 25% of carbon offsets may lack integrity, describing them as ""hot air.""[129][130] Additionally, some reports have raised concerns that carbon offsets could be used to justify the continuation or expansion of fossil fuel projects, potentially delaying direct efforts to reduce emissions.[131]

Using projects in this way is called ""greenwashing"".[132] Pope Francis noted in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato si' the risk that countries and sectors may use carbon credits as ""a ploy which permits maintaining [their] excessive consumption"".[133]

Many projects that give credits for carbon sequestration have received criticism as greenwashing because they overstated their ability to sequester carbon, with some projects being shown to actually increase overall emissions.[19][20][21][22]

In 2023, a civil suit was brought against Delta Air Lines based on its use of carbon credits to support claims of carbon neutrality.[134] In 2016 the Öko-Institut analyzed a series of CDM projects. It found that 85% had a low likelihood of being truly additional or were likely to over-estimate emission reductions.[135] In 2023, the University of California all but dropped the purchase of offsets in favor of direct reductions in emissions.[136]

GM has already sold more than 144,000 EVs in 2025.

Add in the Honda/Acura EVs, and GM’s Ultium platform is at ~193,000 units on the year.

Need to see how much things fall off in Q4, but 175,000 for GM EVs and 230,000 for Ultium in 2025 seem like good targets.

Similarly, there are existing and predicted shortages of healthcare providers who offer SUD treatment, further limiting treatment capacity.
The reauthorized SUPPORT Act attempts to ease some of these challenges while providing much-needed investment in our prevention, treatment, and harm reduction infrastructure.
More Work to Do The passage of the SUPPORT Act reauthorization is good news, but more action is needed to address SUD and overdose deaths.
One important piece of legislation to expand access to evidence-based treatment has stalled in Congress: the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA-A).","On Sept. 18, 2025, something good happened: The Senate unanimously passed legislation to direct significant funds toward combating the opioid crisis. More accurately, no one objected when Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked for unanimous consent to pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025 (i.e., the SUPPORT Act), which the House passed in June. The SUPPORT Act’s passage is surprising since it languished in legislative limbo for two years after the original version expired.

The Substance-Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 was, at the time, the largest congressional investment in overdose prevention ever made. Many of its provisions were limited to five years, expiring at the end of September 2023. Upon that expiration, Congress modified or continued many of the act’s elements via other legislation. These stopgap measures were important, but a full reauthorization gives communities and providers support they can rely on. It also reminds us that bipartisan cooperation—including on evidence-based harm reduction approaches like overdose reversal medications—is still achievable.

A Step in the Right Direction

Many states have too few treatment facilities, making it unsurprising that only 6.3 percent of people in the United States who have substance use disorder (SUD) receive treatment each year. Similarly, there are existing and predicted shortages of healthcare providers who offer SUD treatment, further limiting treatment capacity.

The reauthorized SUPPORT Act attempts to ease some of these challenges while providing much-needed investment in our prevention, treatment, and harm reduction infrastructure. It attempts to expand treatment capacity by investing in programs that support SUD treatment providers, such as educational loan assistance and professional development, and exploring less restrictive regulation of Suboxone, a medication for opioid use disorder that contains buprenorphine and naloxone. Funding for different treatment options, including comprehensive opioid recovery centers, community-based programs, and programs led by people in recovery, is included in the reauthorization. The act also addresses SUD more broadly, allocating funding to programs that support youth prevention and recovery, treatment during and after pregnancy, career support for people in recovery, expanded access to the overdose reversal medication naloxone, overdose reversal training for first responders, and infectious disease monitoring related to injection drug use.

More Work to Do

The passage of the SUPPORT Act reauthorization is good news, but more action is needed to address SUD and overdose deaths. Congress should continue to remove obstacles to a range of intertwined harm reduction and treatment options. Improving access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is particularly important. It’s also important that treatment options be evidence-based, diverse, and able to meet different needs rather than forcing people into a single type of treatment. (We looked at some limitations of current treatment options in a recent Safer Solutions post).

One important piece of legislation to expand access to evidence-based treatment has stalled in Congress: the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA-A). Introduced in 2023, MOTA-A would expand access to methadone—a “gold standard” treatment for people with OUD. Currently, patients can only access methadone through specialized clinics known as opioid treatment programs (OTPs). This system presents a number of barriers for patients, including limited geographic access and restrictive hours and policies. MOTA-A would increase the number of access points to methadone by allowing addiction specialist physicians to prescribe it and pharmacies to dispense it—independent of the OTP system.

Congress can also remove barriers via the Temporary Emergency Scheduling and Testing of Fentanyl Analogues Act of 2023, the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services Act, and the Reentry Act and Due Process Continuity of Care Act. Respectively, these bills would empower scientists to conduct research on the substances in our drug supply, make SUD treatment more accessible (especially for people in rural areas), and boost uninterrupted access to treatment for people re-entering society from incarceration.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AdobeStock_61493778-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-03 07:59:55.166825

Government Shutdown Outlook: On Sept. 29, House and Senate majority and minority leaders, also known as the “Big 4,” met with President Trump to discuss the imminent federal government shutdown. The meeting ended without an agreement, leaving the government on track to shut down on Tuesday at midnight for the first time in over five years. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) pressed for a broader deal that includes extending the enhanced Advance Premium Tax Credits (eAPTCs), reversing health care cuts from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, P.L. 119-21) and limiting the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) ability to rescind congressional funding unilaterally. Minority Leaders Schumer and Jeffries said President Trump appeared open to bipartisan talks on some issues but agreed with Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who pushed for a “clean” stopgap funding bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21 and provide time for potential negotiations along with a final appropriations deal for FY 2026. Behind the scenes, Minority Leader Schumer reportedly considered a short-term extension as a possible compromise but publicly insisted on immediate action to avoid the shutdown.

On the agency side, the Treasury Department released its contingency plan for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and departmental offices in case a deal is not reached. Due to supplemental funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169) available through 2031, the IRS will be able to maintain operations for five business days under the contingency plan. The contingency plan also notes that all employees are funded by these multiyear appropriations and therefore are exempt from furlough, remaining on duty during the shutdown. The plan outlines that, if needed, shutdown activities would take no more than half a day to implement. It also emphasizes that operations (i.e., taxpayer services), enforcement and IT will remain fully staffed and funded.

Additionally, a shutdown is not expected to affect the work of the Office of Tax Policy (OTP) and IRS Chief Counsel significantly with respect to implementation of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), although external engagement with stakeholders may pause until funding resumes.

Earlier this month, OMB issued a memo instructing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs if a government shutdown occurs. The memo contemplates that agencies may issue Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for employees working on programs whose funding would lapse, considering long-term workforce reductions aligned with administration priorities. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provided guidance emphasizing that layoffs could be revised once funding is restored and that employees may receive 60 days’ notice before any separation takes effect.

Energy-Tax Mainlines

Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Comes to an End: As of Oct. 1, consumers can no longer claim federal tax credits for new, previously owned or qualified commercial clean vehicles. The OBBBA’s enactment in July accelerated the phaseout and termination of several clean energy incentives, including sections 25E, 30D and 45W. Taxpayers who entered into a binding contract and made payment before the Sept. 30 deadline may still claim the credit once the vehicle is placed in service. The next clean vehicle incentive scheduled to expire is the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit, which will end on June 30, 2026.

Investment Strategies Shift Toward Clean Energy Projects Qualifying Under Expired Tax Credits: To avoid uncertainty in investment strategies, some investors are directing more capital toward clean energy projects that began construction before the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired at the end of 2024. Banks and corporations are classifying Section 48-eligible projects as lower risk because they are shielded from the added uncertainties of the Section 48E Clean Electricity ITC under the OBBBA. At an industry conference, tax credit investment leaders noted that developers who started projects earlier are now prioritized by investors, with institutions focusing exclusively on Section 48 credit opportunities in the near term.

1111 Constitution Avenue

Treasury Department/IRS Issue 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan: On Oct. 1, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan (PGP) that addresses the tax guidance priorities for the next year. The plan identifies 105 guidance projects that the Treasury Department and IRS will prioritize from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, focusing on implementing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), deregulation and burden reduction, tribal tax issues, digital assets and the SECURE 2.0 Act.

Key upcoming OBBBA regulations in the plan include guidance on deductions for overtime pay, car loan interest and qualified business income, along with permanent expansions of the standard and child tax deductions. The plan also addresses energy tax credits, noting the accelerated phaseout of several clean energy credits after 2025, including the Residential Clean Energy Credit and Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, with deadlines for wind and solar projects extending through 2027. The Clean Fuel Production Credit is extended through 2029 but with more stringent domestic content and ownership requirements, while electric vehicle credits face earlier phaseouts. The PGP also continues to anticipate guidance on the section 45U production credit for existing nuclear facilities.

IRS Issues Proposed Rulemaking for Tipped Income Deduction: On Sept. 22, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations for the “No Tax on Tips” provision enacted under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The provision allows workers in occupations that customarily and regularly received tips to deduct up to $25,000 in qualified tips per year from their income beginning in 2025 through 2028. The deduction is available to both employees and self-employed individuals, regardless of whether they itemize deductions, but phases out for taxpayers earning above $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). “Qualified tips” are defined as voluntary, customer-paid cash or charged tips, but exclude mandatory service charges like auto-gratuities and certain service business categories.

Some of the occupations eligible for the tip deduction include:

Hospitality: housekeeper, bellhop, concierge, hotel desk clerk, valet

Food Service: waiter/waitress, bartender, host, busser, chef, cook, baker, dishwasher, fast food worker

Entertainment & Events: casino dealer, gambling attendant, dancer, musician, DJ, performer, usher, ticket taker, coat/lobby attendant

Personal Appearance & Wellness: hairdresser, barber, nail technician, massage therapist, spa attendant, tattoo artist, fitness instructor, yoga instructor

Transportation & Delivery: taxi driver, rideshare driver, valet attendant, tow truck driver, pizza/grocery/delivery driver, parking garage attendant

Home Services: house cleaner, gardener, landscaper, handyman, plumber, electrician, appliance installer/repairer, locksmith, road assistance worker

Recreation & Leisure: ski instructor, skydiving pilot, golf caddy, recreation guide

Digital Content & Media: online video creator, podcaster, content creator

The proposed rule also provides examples and reporting requirements. The public-comment period is open until Oct. 22, 2025. A public hearing is scheduled for Oct. 23, 2025.

Treasury Department Releases Interim Guidance on CAMT: The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued two new pieces of interim guidance, Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49, addressing the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Notice 2025-46 provides rules for domestic corporate transactions, financially troubled companies and consolidated groups, clarifying how AFSI and CAMT basis should be determined. Notice 2025-49 expands taxpayer flexibility, overhauls reliance rules and introduces targeted AFSI adjustments covering fair value items, utilities, tonnage tax, insurance company NOLs and goodwill amortization.

IRS Workforce Reductions Affecting OBBBA Implementation: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Office of Chief Counsel is facing significant staffing shortages after more than 350 attorneys resigned from the office. The departures have left leadership gaps across several divisions as the agency works towards implementing the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). With limited resources, the office is prioritizing guidance on notable provisions such as tip income and overtime deductions and R&D expenses, while other projects may be delayed or dropped. The division also plays a key role in litigation and the administration’s deregulatory push will most likely see delays as new hires join. While core deadlines are expected to be met, competing legacy priorities from previous laws, like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the government shutdown will complicate an already strained rollout.

IRS to Begin Transitions to Paper Checks: In accordance with the President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) from March titled “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account,” the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will begin to phase out tax refunds on paper checks starting on Sept. 30. While most taxpayers already receive refunds via direct deposit, around 7% still get paper checks. The IRS plans to provide detailed guidance for filing 2025 taxes before the 2026 filing season begins and will continue to accept paper checks from taxpayers until then. The IRS encouraged taxpayers without bank accounts to consider opening one or using prepaid debit cards or digital wallets, with some exceptions available for those who lack access to electronic payment systems.

In response to the IRS announcement about the transition, Sens. Angus King (I-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in addition to Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Chellie Pingree (D-ME) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought urging a delay in implementing the EO. They argue that the accelerated timeline risks harming older and disabled Americans, veterans, small-business owners, farmers, rural and tribal communities and the domestic forest products industry, which relies heavily on demand for paper. They also emphasize that millions remain without bank accounts or lack reliable broadband, making electronic payments inaccessible. The lawmakers called for extending the timeline, enhancing outreach efforts, ensuring waivers are available and requesting detailed information on waiver processes, stakeholder engagement, fraud protections and interagency coordination.

IRS Extends Third Deferred Resignation Offer to Employees: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has extended a deferred resignation offer to select employees currently on administrative leave, allowing them to remain on paid leave until they permanently leave the agency on Dec. 31. This is the third instance in which the IRS has extended the offer and the number of employees offered or who have accepted this most recent offer has not been disclosed. Earlier in the year, about 21,000 IRS employees accepted similar deferred resignation offers. The agency has also placed employees on administrative leave in waves, including senior leadership and IT staff. After a significant number accepted the offers and left over the summer, the IRS has begun hiring again and has invited some employees who previously had intentions to leave to return.

Tax Worldview

U.S. Companies Highlight Importance for the OECD Tax Agreement: In the past few weeks, U.S. multinational companies have expressed concerns to Congress and the Trump administration that the pace of negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to revise the global minimum tax framework, known as Pillar Two, is moving too slowly. Without a timely agreement, including provisions allowing for a “side-by-side” exception for the U.S. international tax system, these companies argue that the 15% global minimum tax will impose significant compliance costs. The side-by-side approach was part of a deal reached in June between the United States and the G-7 countries, leading to the removal of the proposed Section 899 “revenge tax” from the OBBBA.

U.S. business groups have also raised concerns with the Treasury Department regarding Australia’s new Pillar Two country-by-country reporting requirement and the Australian government’s intention to release such reports to the public. Concerns have been raised that the disclosures will affect privately held companies and information about U.S.-parented multinational groups, rather than just Australian subsidiaries.

Relatedly, as negotiations continue to stall, some countries like Kenya, France and Spain have implemented or maintained digital services taxes (DSTs) on technology companies as temporary measures, while others, such as India and Canada, have repealed their DSTs following pressure from the Trump administration.

Treasury Department, IRS to Release International Tax Guidance by Year-End: At an event last week, Huzefa Mun, a Treasury Department attorney, said four pieces of guidance addressing near-term international tax provisions from the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) are expected to be released by year-end. Priority areas include changes to the foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI) rules under Section 250, revisions to the elimination of the one-month deferral rule for controlled foreign corporations under Section 898(c) and guidance on the changes to Sections 951 and 960(b) relating to transition rules and foreign-earned income credits. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are also weighing how stewardship expenses should be allocated under the revamped Net CFC Tested Income (NCTI) regime (the successor to GILTI), while broader changes under the law will be taken up in 2026 through proposed rulemakings.

At A Glance

CAMT Reemerges in Corporate Tax Planning Strategies: The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made several provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, P.L. 115-97) permanent, including immediate deductibility of research and development expenditures. However, the restored R&D benefit may now conflict with the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for some companies, as unamortized deductions from 2022 through 2024 trigger CAMT liability. Energy and technology firms warn they could lose access to hundreds of millions of dollars in credits, while business groups argue the restriction weakens incentives for domestic R&D. Business groups are urging Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration to pursue fixes through legislation or Treasury Department guidance.

Warren Presses JCT on Bonus Depreciation Under OBBBA: On Sept. 29, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a letter to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) expressing concern about the permanent extension of 100% bonus depreciation enacted in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is estimated to cost $362.7 billion over 10 years. She highlighted that the provision primarily benefits large corporations and contends that the provision will result in little economic stimulus. Sen. Warren asked JCT to provide information on which industries and companies benefited most from bonus depreciation between 2018 and 2022, how it may affect tax liabilities in 2025 and 2026, the types of assets written off and the effects of the provision’s retroactive application.

The building is a symbol of what private-sector leadership can achieve, but Farley says Ford cannot turn the essential economy around alone.
Dimon advised Ford to “take the lead,” but to enlist support from other companies, NGOs, family offices, and state and local policymakers.
But he believes that Silicon Valley’s large language model-makers have drifted too far from companies like Ford, and from its essential economy customers.
Strengthening Ford’s position in the highly profitable truck and van division that sells to the essential economy is central to Farley’s strategy.","Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley stood in front of a crowd in Detroit this week and said that if Henry Ford were alive today, “he’d be really upset at all of us.” His audience included US Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and CEOs from AT&T’s John Stankey to TIAA’s Thasunda Brown Duckett. His message was that the US has let its “essential economy” fall into crisis.

Farley, whose grandfather helped build Henry Ford’s Model T cars, defines the essential economy as “everything we build, move, and fix.” That includes the 95 million workers and 3 million small businesses that depend on trucks, vans, and other commercial vehicles, like those made by his Ford Pro division. Critical industries from construction to transportation, which drive $12 trillion of GDP, are suffering from worsening staffing shortages, maddening bureaucracy, and sliding productivity, he warns. “It’s a huge crisis, and it’s not getting better, it’s getting worse.”

In an interview conducted via video call from the passenger seat of a new Lincoln Navigator, Farley says three things came together to spark his alarm. Ford dealerships have a 6,000-person shortage of technicians; entry-level Ford workers have told Farley that they need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet; and he has observed a widening gulf between Ford Pro’s struggling customers and tech evangelists who say AI will transform society.

“If you listen to technology companies, the answer is, just buy more AI products from them and we’ll be fine,” he says. But as he learned more about the difficulties facing Ford’s commercial customers, “I just realized, oh my God, we are in deep trouble here.”

The promise and limits of private-sector leadership

Ford billed this week’s gathering in Detroit as the first national conversation on the essential economy, but Farley says he’s tired of talk. “I’m not really interested in observing or admiring the problem anymore,” he explains, noting that Ford structured its event around a series of solution-seeking workshops. “If we can walk away with two or three really meaty actions for the three main problems — productivity, [worker] shortages, [and the] regulatory environment — then I’ll be happy with that outcome.”

Farley argues that America must reform the bureaucracy that slows down permitting, invest in apprenticeships and trade schools, and make AI “supercharge” the productivity of front-line workers, rather than replace them.

He delivered his pitch in the once-derelict Michigan Central Station, which Ford bought in 2018 and reopened last year as the centerpiece of a new innovation district. The building is a symbol of what private-sector leadership can achieve, but Farley says Ford cannot turn the essential economy around alone.

The planning for what he hopes will be the first of many Ford Pro Accelerate events began early this year, after he consulted JPMorgan Chase Chief Jamie Dimon about how to drive action on the kind of problems that one company cannot solve by itself. Dimon advised Ford to “take the lead,” but to enlist support from other companies, NGOs, family offices, and state and local policymakers.

The blind spots of breakthrough technologies

Like most of his peers, Farley sees AI’s potential for everything from improving warranty processes to training novice technicians to repair complex engines. But he believes that Silicon Valley’s large language model-makers have drifted too far from companies like Ford, and from its essential economy customers. “So far, [they] basically come to us and say, ‘here’s my solution, buy this to make your engineers more productive,’” he says. “The technologists have yet to fashion their technology towards this part of the economy… Their go-to methodology is, ‘Let’s fix big problems that we can sell to big companies or big institutions.’ They don’t like these dirty problems that are complicated.”

Farley sees an irony in this disconnect: “They’re building all these data centers that require essential economy people, and then they complain, ‘Well, I can’t find [people], my construction is behind time, it’s costing too much.’ It’s like, ‘Well, why are you complaining about the very thing that you could help solve?’”

His concern is shared by other industrial executives, such as Barbara Humpton, the former head of Siemens USA, who this week moved to run USA Rare Earth, a rare earth materials and magnets supplier. Humpton told Semafor she sees huge opportunities for “industrial AI,” but when Silicon Valley talks of transforming manufacturing, she asks: “Have you done any manufacturing?”

For Farley, that disconnect speaks to a growing cultural divide in how Americans view essential economy careers. “Our society does not honor these vocations like when our grandparents did these jobs,” he says. “I mean, how many times have you and I seen politicians run to shake hands with a union member on the [shop] floor? But they’re doing it to connect as voters. They’re not connecting with them as humans and thinking about how to serve them as policy leaders.”

Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, pushed to bring more manufacturing to US shores, Farley notes. “For the first time, we started to get industrial policy in the US, and yet, they hadn’t thought through this piece of it.”

Chaos and progress as government takes the wheel

Farley is one of the few US CEOs to have expressed frustration with Trump’s trade agenda publicly, saying in February that the president’s tariffs had created “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,” and estimating more recently that they may cost Ford $2 billion.

“I’d say we’ve made some progress on the policy side,” he says now. “But there’s more work to be done — a lot more work to be done.”

Bilateral trade agreements with South Korea, Japan, and the UK have brought some clarity, he says now, and a rollback of tailpipe emissions regulations will offset some of the tariff costs. But he sounds resigned to the prospect of US policy changing sharply after every election.

“What we’ve learned at Ford after 120 years and certainly now, is we have to have our own plan,” he says. On issues like CO2 emissions, “We’re not going to rely wholly on administration policy. We have to make our own judgment as a company, and I think that’s been a bit of an awakening for us.”

On stage in Detroit this week, Farley spelled out the stark potential impact of Trump’s reversal of one of his predecessor’s policies. The Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles could cut EV sales in the US in half next month, he said, to just 5% of the US vehicle market. “It’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.”

Staying alert after a wake-up call

This week also marked Farley’s fifth anniversary as CEO. Asked what the milestone meant to him, he replied: “To be honest, not much… I think we’ve built a solid foundation at Ford, but to build that North Star company, we have a lot of work to do.”

Ford’s annual revenues have grown from $127 billion to $185 billion over Farley’s tenure. But its stock’s advance has lagged that of rival GM as costly recalls to fix quality defects have detracted from Farley’s strategic refocusing and efforts to improve profit margins. Strengthening Ford’s position in the highly profitable truck and van division that sells to the essential economy is central to Farley’s strategy.

So, too, is finding the right response to Americans’ sputtering adoption of electric vehicles, and a path to profitability for Ford Model e, the group’s loss-making EV division.

After a chastening trip to China, Farley declared that the advanced, low-cost electric vehicles being produced by Chinese automakers like BYD posed “an existential threat” to Ford. He responded by shipping some of his rivals’ models to Michigan for his engineers to pull apart and learn from.

At the same time, he revealed that he had formed a secret “skunkworks” program two years earlier, led by Apple and Tesla veteran Doug Field, to develop EVs affordable enough to compete.

“I looked my team in the eye and I said, ‘Can you match BYD’s IT?’ They said, ‘Maybe.’ And I said, ‘No, I don’t think you can,’” Farley explains. Ford’s computer-aided design system was 20 years old, and the company lacked the specialized talent he needed, he says. “I can’t just take [internal combustion engine] people and throw them in an EV and say, ‘Make me a world-class battery.’”

Farley thinks the gap between US and Chinese carmakers has continued to widen, as Beijing underwrites loss-making automakers at a level that Washington is not willing to do.

The Ford Universal EV Platform, a new manufacturing process that he dubbed a “Model T moment” for EVs when he unveiled it last month, gives him confidence that Ford is “pretty ready” for the competition. But, he cautions, “the standard changes every month, so we could feel comfortable where we’re going to be in a year, but in three years, are we going to be fully competitive with BYD in Mexico? That’s a whole different question.”

Farley acknowledges the challenge of integrating the two cultures — his stealthy high-tech team, and the manufacturers who’ve been mass-producing vehicles for decades “Actually executing at scale, this maverick team has never done that, so now that’s what we’re doing. We’re a year and a half away from launch, and now this stuff’s going to get real.”

Once again, Farley is wary of letting complacency creep in. “I have no idea what’s going to happen,” he admits. “Everyone in this world wants the CEO to say, ‘Everything will be fine.’ [But] we’ve never built a car like this...

Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

The proposal envisions roles in construction, infrastructure development, grid upgrades, engineering, and manufacturing of green technologies. By tying job creation to clean energy expansion, the strategy aims to generate momentum in regional economies across the country and draw in new investment into low-carbon industries.

Beyond sheer numbers, the proposals also emphasize quality and fairness. The plan includes a Fair Work Charter designed to ensure decent pay, secure conditions, rights at work, and protections against exploitative practices. In particular, attention is being paid to closing loopholes that currently allow certain roles in the energy transition to undercut standards. The vision is of a clean energy economy where growth does not come at the cost of workers’ security or dignity.

The announcement further nominates priority occupations, such as engineers, welders, electricians, and construction trades, for rapid expansion, backed by training incentives and funding for skills development. The goal is not simply to create roles but to make these careers sustainable and attractive long term. Regions that host industrial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities are expected to see direct gains, with the potential for supply chains and local service industries to grow in support.

Critically, the government plans to integrate this jobs agenda into a broader industrial and climate policy framework. The narrative positions clean energy not as a niche or side project, but as a foundation of future economic resilience. By backing smart infrastructure, renewable generation, and modernisation of networks, the plan seeks to align labour market growth with decarbonisation goals. Communities across the country are being offered a chance to take part in the energy transition, both as places of production and as beneficiaries of improved connectivity, clean air, and economic opportunity.

The proposal is being cast as a turning point: an opportunity to redefine how energy, jobs, and climate goals intersect. It sends a signal that the next wave of industrial growth will be green, and that the prosperity of tomorrow depends on building a workforce equipped for the clean energy era.

For Tesla (TSLA), it's customers rushing to purchase vehicles just before the expiration of crucial tax credits. The electric auto company reported surprisingly strong third quarter global deliveries Thursday as the sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US appeared to reverse what had been a sales decline.

The sunny report served as a stark reminder that Tesla, and other EV makers, face a harsher market ahead without the draw and cushion of government subsidies. Because it wasn't just Tesla that enjoyed a last-minute feast of sales.

The rush to cash in on tax breaks before their end comes at a moment of uncertainty for Tesla. A challenging first half of the year, tied in part to the public backlash against CEO Elon Musk, has weighed on the company, just as it works to redefine itself as an AI and robotics giant.

That helps explain why the stock fell even after beating Wall Street delivery estimates, but remains near all-time highs.

If the criticism against Tesla — the stock — is that it is divorced from the actual business of selling cars, then the response from its leadership and faithful backers is that Tesla isn't a car company, and shouldn't trade like one.

Investors are eyeing production plans for the Cybercab, Tesla's dedicated autonomous vehicle at the heart of its robotaxi service. The company plans to start churning them out as soon as next year. And the bulls hope it's a paradigm shift.

""The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next six to nine months has now begun,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note to clients on Thursday.

But what's most striking about Tesla's bull case is that even as the company says farewell to special tax breaks, its most optimistic forecasts rely on — and perhaps even take for granted — another kind of government assistance elevating the company to multitrillion-dollar heights.

Ives said he expects the Trump White House to fast-track Tesla's autonomous initiatives. As Washington battles Beijing in an AI arms race, companies like Tesla serve a useful purpose to the US government, the thinking goes. American AI leadership aligns the goals of the administration with those of Musk and his investors.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has made a similar geopolitical argument for why it's important for his company to compete in China. And other Silicon Valley heavyweights have cautioned that aggressively regulating tech companies would give a leg up to unburdened Chinese firms.

Back to the reality of Tesla's car sales, where most of the company's business comes from: The news was good, at least for the moment. But on a broader scale, the end of a special benefit doesn't seem to matter when another, even bigger one is on its way.

The two companies have entered into a new Engineering Services Agreement (ESA), marking the next stage of collaboration on what will be the nation’s first transmission line to directly connect three major energy markets.

The 420-mile North Plains Connector will operate as a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system running at ±525 kilovolts. Once complete, it will be capable of carrying up to 3,000 megawatts of electricity in either direction. Enough to power millions of homes and businesses. By linking Montana and North Dakota to the wider grid, the project will support the growing energy needs of AI data centers, industrial electrification, and communities across the country.

The New Engineering Services Agreement (ESA)

Under the ESA, Hitachi Energy will provide early-stage engineering work, including the design of converter station specifications. This step is intended to reduce project risk, strengthen supply chain planning, and speed up overall execution. The agreement builds on the companies’ earlier collaboration announced in March 2024 and underscores their shared commitment to advancing HVDC technology in the U.S.

“Allie Wahrenberger, Vice President of Engineering for Grid United, said the project represents a milestone for the U.S. transmission system. ‘North Plains Connector will be the first transmission system connecting three major U.S. energy markets. Supporting a key Department of Energy goal of enhancing grid reliability and resilience. We are excited to move forward with world-class engineering from Hitachi Energy,’ she noted.”

Connecting Eastern and Western U.S. Grids

The project will integrate the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). By improving grid coordination across these organizations, the North Plains Connector is expected to unlock new capacity, reduce bottlenecks, and strengthen overall reliability. Local communities in Montana and North Dakota are also projected to benefit from job creation and increased tax revenue once construction begins.

Hitachi Energy executives emphasized that the partnership illustrates how early collaboration can help streamline complex projects. “This new agreement with Grid United is a perfect example of how a long-term collaboration built on trust and a shared vision can accelerate delivery and mitigate risk,” said Nathanael Occenad, Vice President and Regional HVDC Sales Manager for Hitachi Energy in the Americas.

Long-distance transmission lines like the North Plains Connector are increasingly critical as the U.S. works to balance abundant low-cost power generation with surging electricity demand. Beyond its regional benefits, the project is aligned with broader national energy strategies, including the White House AI Action Plan, which prioritizes a stronger grid to secure U.S. competitiveness in artificial intelligence and advanced technologies.

Alongside the North Plains Connector, Hitachi Energy is actively advancing other major U.S. initiatives, including a $457 million power transformer manufacturing plant in South Boston, Virginia. The largest such investment in Southside Virginia, set to establish the region as a hub for high-tech electrical infrastructure.

Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced on Wednesday that funds would be canceled for 223 projects across 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

According to a list by House Appropriations Committee Democrats, 34 projects in Colorado are on the chopping block.

The cancellations affect places like Colorado State University, the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office, among others, whose grants have been marked for termination.

""Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,"" the Energy Department wrote.

Denver7 political analyst Alton Dillard said the cuts send a clear political message.

""One, it is always going to be concerning that having a clean climate is somehow become politicized,"" said Dillard. ""But it also is sending the message that if you are in a state that supported Harris, that you're going to pay.""

Dillard warned of significant consequences for Colorado's energy sector.

""In a state like Colorado that's known for innovation and entrepreneurship, the downstream effects, I think, are going to be dire,"" he explained. ""So you add this back in again to the fact that we're also in the middle of a government shutdown, and I know it's an overused term, but we are at a major inflection point in not only clean energy, but just government in general.""

Dillard added that no one should be surprised by this move, as it delivers on exactly what the Trump administration said it was going to do.

The cancellations are likely to face legal challenges. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, recipients of those awards will have 30 days to appeal the department's decision.

Reaction from Colorado's lawmakers

In the wake of the cuts, Denver7 is hearing from Colorado lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, said the move was connected to the government shutdown and blamed Senate Democrats.

Democratic Senator John Hickenlooper, meanwhile, said the cuts ""punish Americans who dared to vote against"" the Trump administration.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/030e760/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2Fc6%2F4ec6e78b4830b06455863d9d1181%2Fdept-of-energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:09:08.531464

… It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.” Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center.
Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy.

“I’ve always been in energy because I think it’s just far and away the world’s most important industry,” Wright said at the forum, which included a panel discussion with business leaders and a fireside chat with MIT Professor Ernest Moniz, who was the U.S. secretary of energy from 2013 to 2017. Wright added: “Not only is it by far the world’s most important industry, because it enables all the others, but it’s also a booming time right now. … It is an awesomely exciting time to be in energy.”

Wright was greeted on campus by MIT President Sally Kornbluth, who also gave introductory remarks at the forum, held in MIT’s Samberg Center. While the Institute has added many research facilities and buildings since Wright was a student, Kornbluth observed, the core MIT ethos remains the same.

“MIT is still MIT,” Kornbluth said. “It’s a community that rewards merit, boldness, and scientific rigor. And it’s a magnet for people with a drive to solve hard problems that matter in the real world, an enthusiasm for working with industry, and an ethic of national service.”

When it comes to energy research, Kornbluth added, “MIT is developing transformational approaches to make American energy more secure, reliable, affordable, and clean — which in turn will strengthen both U.S. competitiveness and national security.”

At the event, Wright, the 17th U.S. secretary of energy, engaged in a fireside chat with Moniz, the 13th U.S. secretary of energy, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Post-Tenure, a special advisor to the MIT president, and the founding director of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). Wright began his remarks by reflecting on Kornbluth’s description of the Institute.

“Merit, boldness, and scientific rigor,” Wright said. “That is MIT … to me. That hit me hard when I got here, and frankly, it’s a good part of the reason my life has gone the way it’s gone.”

On energy topics, Wright emphasized the need for continued innovation in energy across a range of technologies, including fusion, geothermal, and more, while advocating for the benefits of vigorous market-based progress. Before becoming secretary of energy, Wright most recently served as founder and CEO of Liberty Energy. He also was the founder of Pinnacle Technologies, among other enterprises. Wright was confirmed as secretary by the U.S. Senate in February.

Asked to name promising areas of technological development, Wright focused on three particular areas of interest. Citing artificial intelligence, he noted that the interest in it was “overwhelming,” with many possible applications. Regarding fusion energy, Wright said, “We are going to see meaningful breakthroughs.” And quantum computing, he added, was going to be a “game-changer” as well.

Wright also emphasized the value of federal support for fundamental research, including projects in the national laboratories the Department of Energy oversees.

“The 17 national labs we have in this country are absolute jewels. They are gems of this country,” Wright said. He later noted, “There are things, like this foundational research, that are just an essential part of our country and an essential part of our future.”

Moniz asked Wright a range of questions in the fireside chat, while adding his own perspective at times about the many issues connected to energy abundance globally.

“Climate, energy, security, equity, affordability, have to be recognized as one conversation, and not separate conversations,” Moniz said. “That’s what’s at stake in my view.”

Wright’s appearance was part of the Energy Freedom Tour developed by the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), in coordination with the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University. Later stops are planned for Stanford University and Texas A&M University.

Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute, gave remarks at the forum as well, noting the importance of making students aware of the energy industry and helping to “get them excited about the impact this career can make.” She also praised MIT’s advances in the field, adding, “This is where so many ideas were born and executed that have allowed America to really thrive in this energy abundance in our country that we have [had] for so long.”

The forum also featured remarks from Roger Martella, chief corporate officer, chief sustainability officer, and head of government affairs at GE Vernova. In March, MIT and GE Vernova announced a new five-year joint program, the MIT-GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance, featuring research projects, education programs, and career opportunities for MIT students.

“That’s what we’re about, electrification as the lifeblood of prosperity,” Martella said, describing GE Vernova’s work. “When we’re here at MIT we feel like we’re living history every moment when we’re walking down the halls, because no institution has [contributed] to innovation and technology more, doing it every single day to advance prosperity for all people around the world.”

A panel discussion at the forum featured Wright speaking along with three MIT alumni who are active in the energy business: Carlos Araque ’01, SM ’02, CEO of Quaise Energy, a leading-edge firm in geothermal energy solutions; Bob Mumgaard SM ’15, PhD ’15, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a leading fusion energy firm and an MIT spinout; and Milo Werner SM ’07, MBA ’07, a general partner at DCVC and expert in energy and climate investments. The panel was moderated by Chris Barnard, president of the ACC.

Mumgaard noted that Commonwealth Fusion Systems launched in 2018 with “an explicit mission, working with MIT still today, of putting fusion onto an industrial trajectory,” although there is “plenty left to do, still, at that intersection of science, technology, innovation, and business.”

Araque said he believes geothermal is “metric-by-metric” more powerful and profitable than many other forms of energy. “This is not a stop-gap,” he added. Quaise is currently developing its first power-plant-scale facility in the U.S.

Werner noted that the process of useful innovation only begins in the lab; making an advance commercially viable is the critical next step. The biggest impact “is not in the breakthrough,” she said. “It’s not in the discovery that you make in the lab. It’s actually once you’ve built a billion of them. That’s when you actually change the world.”

After the forum, Wright took a tour of multiple research centers on the MIT campus, including the MIT.nano facility, guided by Vladimir Bulović, faculty director of MIT.nano and the Fariborz Maseeh Chair in Emerging Technology.

At MIT.nano, Bulović showed Wright the Titan Krios G3i, a nearly room-size electron microscope that enables researchers to take a high-resolution look at the structure of tiny particles, with a variety of research applications. The tour also viewed one of MIT.nano’s cleanrooms, a shared fabrication facility used by both MIT researchers and users outside of MIT, including many in industry.

On a different note, in an MIT.nano hallway, Bulović showed Wright the One.MIT mosaics, which contain the names of all MIT students and employees past and present — well over 300,000 in all. First etched on a 6-inch wafer, the mosaics are a visual demonstration of the power of nanotechnology — and a searchable display, so Bulović located Wright’s name, which is printed near the chin of one of the figures on the MIT seal.

The tour ended in the basement of Building 10, in what is now the refurbished Grainger Energy Machine Facility, where Wright used to conduct research. After earning his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, Wright entered into graduate studies at MIT before leaving, as he recounted at the forum, to pursue business opportunities.

At the lab, Wright met with David Perreault, the Ford Foundation Professor of Engineering; and Steven Leeb, the Emanuel Landsman Professor, a specialist in power systems. A half-dozen MIT graduate students gave Wright demos of their research projects, all involving energy-generation innovations. Wright readily engaged with all the graduate students about the technologies and the parameters of the devices, and asked the students about their own careers.

Wright was accompanied on the lab tour by MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, himself an expert in developing energy-efficient systems. Chandrakasan delivered closing remarks at the forum in the Samberg Center, noting MIT’s “strong partnership with the Department of Energy” and its “long and proud history of engaging industry.”

As such, Chandrakasan said, MIT has a “role as a resource in service of the nation, so please don’t hesitate to call on us.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/MIT-Energy%20Secretary-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 12:12:01.345648

The group said the legislation is necessary in order to address some of the larger challenges facing the river basin, which stretches across 31 states. Issues like the annual Gulf of Mexico “dead zone” and floodwater control affect multiple states, requiring a more holistic approach, they claim.

“This is a national problem that needs a national solution,” Coalition Manager Gerald Blessey said in a release. “The Mississippi River Basin covers 41 percent of the continental United States.”

Mississippi commercial fisheries were hard hit in 2019, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to open the Bonnet Carré Spillway two times to divert floodwater away from population centers. That decision sent a surge of freshwater into the ocean, with the resultant drop in salinity shocking and killing shrimp, oysters, and other species. Those commercial fisheries are still struggling to recover. The U.S. government has since declared the incident fishery disaster, authorizing USD 88 million (EUR 80.6 million) in financial support to Southern states impacted by the event.

As cooler weather sets in, households across the country face a tough question: keep repairing their old heating and cooling systems or finally replace them with new ones.

While squeezing every penny out of an old unit might seem like a way to save money, experts caution that waiting can lead to higher costs, less comfort and missed opportunities for major savings.

The hidden cost of “just one more repair”

Older HVAC systems often need frequent service and those repair bills can add up. Bandage-type repairs on current units could lead to more surprise bills from repair people who usually do not offer financing plans. With contractor schedules filling up during peak seasons, a breakdown at the wrong time could mean long delays for repairs or replacements — leaving your home uncomfortable when you need it most.

Beyond the financial drain, there is the stress of dealing with an unexpected breakdown during extreme weather. Having to replace an HVAC system in the middle of a breakdown denies you the opportunity to shop around and purchase a system that best fits your home and needs. Similarly, replacing an unreliable system with a newer model can provide consistent comfort, improved efficiency and financial predictability.

Fall is the ideal time for replacement

Fall is considered the “shoulder season” in the HVAC industry. Contractors generally have more availability than during the busy summer and winter months, which makes scheduling easier. With the more moderate weather conditions during fall, you may be more comfortable without heating or cooling while the new system is being installed. Acting in fall also avoids the risk of facing a system failure in the middle of a cold snap when demand is high and options may be limited.

Incentives can make upgrading more affordable

For a limited time, programs are available to help homeowners manage the cost of replacement. This fall, certain high-efficiency systems from Carrier qualify for rebates of up to $2,100 and financing plans with 0% APR for 60 months, giving families the ability to spread out payments without extra interest.

In addition, federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offer homeowners tax credits — such as up to $2,000 back for installing a qualifying high-efficiency heat pump — further lowering the net cost. These IRA incentives are set to expire at the end of the year, making this fall the perfect time to upgrade.

Ensure comfort and efficiency during the holidays

The holiday season is a busy time and usually includes hosting loved ones. Guarantee your celebrations go off without a hitch and your guests stay warm and comfortable by replacing your old unit during the fall months.

Modern HVAC systems do more than heat and cool; they can help maintain balanced humidity, reduce drafts, improve air quality and eliminate uneven hot or cold spots throughout your home. Plus, the energy efficiency of your new heating and cooling system may help you save on monthly utility bills — savings you can put toward holiday shopping.

While it may be tempting to prolong the life of an old HVAC system, delaying replacement can end up being more expensive and stressful. With incentives, financing and tax credits available this fall, planning ahead can help you save money and enjoy year-round comfort.

Commonwealth LNG could go ahead and make a final investment decision on an $11 billion plant in Cameron Parish before the end of the year, Scott said.
And the $10 billion Lake Charles LNG retrofit could get a final investment decision before the end of 2026, he said.
The job gains in metro Monroe are entirely driven by the Meta data center, which will create 5,000 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs.
The $18 billion expansion at the Venture Global LNG export terminal in Plaquemines Parish will provide a boost.","Louisiana is projected to add 74,500 jobs over the next two years, extending a five-year run of job gains in the state since the pandemic, due to expansions in the liquefied natural gas industry and construction of Meta’s $10 billion artificial intelligence data center.

The job gains, if they occur, would represent a faster pace of job growth than the state is projected to add in 2025, according to economist Loren Scott, who released his annual economic forecast earlier this week at the Louisiana Business Symposium, an economic conference hosted by the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report.

Scott said Louisiana is expected to finally have more than 2 million jobs by the end of the year, and that number will grow over the next two years.

The state has come close to breaking the 2 million mark for nonfarm jobs in 2015 and 2019, but a drop in oil prices, then the COVID pandemic caused job numbers to plunge.

""Let's hope for the best,"" Scott said, noting that while data centers and LNG export terminals are adding jobs, there could be disruptions, such as AI taking away the need for some workers.

Lake Charles, which has two LNG terminals under construction and could potentially add two more before the end of the year, and Monroe, which will benefit from the Meta data center and two Entergy power plants providing electricity for it, are expected to be the fastest-growing regions of the state, according to Scott.

Both Lake Charles and Monroe are expected to post an 8% gain in jobs by the end of 2027, Scott said. That would add 8,600 jobs in Lake Charles and 7,500 in Monroe.

Lake Charles is benefiting from the Trump administration’s decision to move ahead with permitting LNG facilities quickly. That’s in contrast to the Biden administration’s move to pause export permits on manufacturing plants such as Calcasieu Pass 2, while their impact on global warming could be studied.

Since April, Woodside Energy has announced plans for the $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG facility in Calcasieu Parish, while Venture Global has started work on CP2, a $15.1 billion facility. Each plant will create 7,500 temporary construction jobs and several hundred permanent jobs.

Commonwealth LNG could go ahead and make a final investment decision on an $11 billion plant in Cameron Parish before the end of the year, Scott said. And the $10 billion Lake Charles LNG retrofit could get a final investment decision before the end of 2026, he said.

The job gains in metro Monroe are entirely driven by the Meta data center, which will create 5,000 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs. Entergy plans to spend $2.2 billion to build two natural gas power plants to meet the needs of the data center, which will be around the size of 70 football fields. The power needs of the plant are significant; the Center for Energy Studies at LSU estimates Meta’s consumption alone will boost electricity consumption in Louisiana by 15%.

Scott said that the other major employers in Monroe, such as the Foster Farms poultry plant, the Graphics Packaging paper plant and the JPMorgan Chase Mortgage customer service center, are expected to see employment hold steady or even fall slightly.

Baton Rouge is projected to see a 4.9% job gain over the next two years, adding 21,600 new positions, thanks to industrial construction in Ascension Parish. Scott said more than $20 billion in projects are in motion, most are in the 17,000-acre RiverPlex MegaPark, a mixed-use development on the west bank of the parish bordering the Mississippi River. The RiverPlex MegaPark development will be anchored by the $5.8 billion Hyundai steel mill project which Gov. Jeff Landry and Ascension Parish officials committed $600 million to upgrade the MegaPark land with a wastewater treatment plant, road and rail updates and land purchases. The project will create 1,300 direct jobs.

All of the other metro areas in Louisiana are expected to see job gains that fall below the 3.7% increase that is projected to happen over the next two years.

Hammond and St. Tammany Parish are both projected to see 3.4% gains in new jobs. Hammond will be boosted by expansions at North Oaks Health System and Southeastern Louisiana University, while St. Tammany will be boosted by continuing gains at Globalstar and Pool Corp.

Shreveport-Bossier City is expected to see 3.3% growth because of growth prospects at the Cyber Research Park, the former GM plant and the Port of Caddo-Bossier. There's a chance a data center could move into the area, because of the easy access to the abundant supply of cheap natural gas in the Haynesville Shale, Scott said.

Lafayette is forecast to see a 2.8% gain in jobs, as tariffs weigh down the offshore drilling industry. SafeSource Direct’s recent suspension of operations is also expected to hurt the local economy.

Globally, investors are pouring more money into renewable energy than ever — even as they pull back on spending in the U.S.

Over the first six months of this year, a total of $386 billion flowed to projects ranging from small rooftop solar installations to massive offshore wind farms, according to research firm BloombergNEF. That’s 10% higher than what investors doled out in the first half of 2024.

But the story is very different when you zoom in on the U.S.

As President Donald Trump enacts a scorched-earth campaign against renewables — particularly offshore wind — clean-energy investors are fleeing the nation’s increasingly volatile market. Spending was down by 12% compared to the first half of last year.

To an extent, the U.S.’s loss may have been Europe’s gain, according to BNEF. The European Union saw investment jump by 27% in the first half of this year, due in large part to major offshore wind developers shifting their focus from beleaguered projects on America’s East Coast to those in Europe’s North Sea. In the UK., another offshore wind hot spot, investment tripled compared to the first half of last year, rising to $6.6 billion.

That increasing interest in erecting turbines in European waters helped buoy global investment figures. The offshore wind sector may be crumbling in the U.S. under Trump, but worldwide, it attracted more money in the first six months of this year than in all of last year.

Small-scale solar is also quickly gaining ground, especially in China, where investment in the energy source almost doubled even as funding for utility-scale solar fell by 28% due to policy changes that make those larger projects less lucrative.

Overall, the investment figures are trending in the right direction: up.

Well, maybe.

The electric vehicle maker run by Musk reported Thursday that car sales jumped 7% in the three months through September after plunging for most of the year as people turned off by his embrace of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe balked at buying his cars.

But the jump comes with a caveat: Tesla benefited from consumers taking advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30, a surge in buying that helped all EV makers.

In fact, many Tesla rivals saw sales rise more. Rivian Automotive reported a 32% increase.

Tesla stock rose sharply on the sales news, but closed the day down 4.5% to $439 amid skepticism the new number really signals a turnaround given all the anti-Musk backlash.

“I don’t think most people are any more enamored with Elon now than they were a few months ago,"" said Telemetry Insight's Sam Abuelsamid. ""I expect this is more a blip for Tesla than the restart of growth.”

Even Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities was cautious, noting there are ""still demand issues.”

Still, it was a blowout number with sales hitting 497,099 vehicles versus 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected a small drop to 456,000.

Investors cheered Musk’s decision in April to leave Washington for Austin, Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. But he is still heavily involved in political and social wars, alienating potential car buyers.

On Wednesday, he posted on X that he was canceling his Netflix subscription because of critical comments made by the creator of a show on the streaming service, which appeared to spark a wave of cancellations in turn.

The sharp fall in Tesla stock Thursday was remarkable as investors have been surprisingly optimistic about the company in recent weeks despite terrible financial figures.

Investors drove the stock up 34% in September alone in a bet that Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. Musk has also been successful in shifting investor attention away from cars to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

Driving the stock higher has also been Musk’s apparent renewed focus on the company.

To hold his attention, Tesla's board proposed last month a pay package that would allow Musk to earn $1 trillion if he meets certain financial goals over the next several years. The pay offer, unprecedented for U.S. companies known for outsized CEO compensation, drew criticism from Pope Leo in an interview lamenting widening income gaps.

If Musk meets the goals, he could set a record on top of his own record. He recently became the first person ever to hit $500 billion in net worth, at least according to rich list compiler Forbes magazine.

The 7% sales rise in the last quarter compares with a 13% dropped in the first three months of the year when Musk led Trump's government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales plunged 13% again.

The anti-Musk backlash in Europe had been also been fierce. Sales plunged 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Musk said a British prime minister was an ""evil tyrant"" who belongs in prison and told Germans ""things will get very, very much worse"" in their country if they didn't vote for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. Protests broke out in several cities, including a hanging of the billionaire in effigy in Milan and posters in London likening him to a Nazi.

For her part, the Tesla head of the board of directors who approved Musk’s latest pay package recently told Bloomberg that she is not sure if Musk’s politics have had any impact on the company’s finances. Robyn Denholm has earned nearly $700 million in compensation for serving on the board since 2014, a package that itself has drawn criticism.

Tesla reports third-quarter earnings later this month. Profits for the previous quarter fell 16% as the company continued to lose market share to European EV makers and fast-growing Chinese rivals, such as BYD.

Musk's new robotaxi service, which began with a test-run in Austin in June, has had some hitches with reports of the cabs stopping suddenly for no reason and even driving in the opposing lane in one instance. But Musk says the service will quickly roll out anyway with launches in several other cities by the end of next year.

September 2025 had one additional selling day compared with September 2024, meaning that sales were up by 1.1% YoY on a selling day-adjusted basis.

The daily selling rate was measured at 51.9k units/day in September, down from 54.6k units/day in August. The annualized selling rate was estimated at 16.4 million units/year in September, up from 16.1 million units/year in August. Retail sales were estimated at 1.03 million units, up by 5.2% YoY, while fleet sales were thought to total 211k units, up by 7.2% YoY.

GM once again led the market, with total sales of 219k units, and a market share of 17.6%, its highest share since April. Toyota Group ranked second, with volumes of 186k units, but its market share was only 14.9%, the OEM’s lowest since March. Ford Group came in third, with sales of 160k units, and a share of 12.9%. The most unexpected result in September, however, was that Stellantis recorded its highest market share since June 2024, at 8.9%, and it was the first time that Stellantis had beaten Honda Group since that same month. A higher fleet share than is normal for several Stellantis brands appeared to partly explain this performance.

At a brand level, Toyota topped the rankings, on 159k units, ahead of Ford on 153k units and Chevrolet on 139k units.

The Ford F-150 returned to the top of the sales rankings in September, on 38.9k units, after having been usurped by the Toyota RAV4 in August. The F-150’s sales were disrupted by a recall in August, but did not appear to be too badly hindered in September. The RAV4 came in second, on 36.6k units, followed by the Chevrolet Equinox, on 31.4k units. The Equinox appeared to be boosted by sales of its EV variant, as buyers took advantage of EV tax credits before they expired.

According to initial estimates, Compact Non-Premium SUV was once again the bestselling segment, with a market share of 22.0%, a six-month high. Strong showings from the Hyundai Tucson and Hyundai IONIQ 5 helped to drive this performance. On the other hand, Midsize Non-Premium SUV saw its share slip to 16.3%, its lowest of Q3, as share for the Hyundai Palisade and Honda Prologue eased back from recent highs. In the case of the Prologue, a lack of inventory reportedly restricted the model from posting higher volumes. Meanwhile, the Large Pickup segment accounted for 14.0% of the market in September. Ram’s trucks recorded their highest market share of the year to date, but it remains to be seen whether this performance can be sustained.

David Oakley, Manager, Americas Sales Forecasts, GlobalData, said: “September rounded out Q3 with another strong result, continuing the recent theme of resilience in the face of upheaval in the industry. The removal of tax credits at the end of the month likely pulled forward sales of EVs, but the wider story is that even models of other propulsion types are performing much more robustly than would have been expected earlier in the year, given the backdrop of tariffs. There has still been very little movement in pricing, and incentives also remain steady, providing the environment for sales to continue flowing. Most automakers appear still to be doing their utmost to absorb cost pressures, and some have indicated a willingness to extend offers into October to cushion the blow from the lack of EV tax credits. The longer that consumers can be persuaded that price increases are imminent, the more motivation there will be to buy now, while a stock market near all-time highs is also helping to support activity. The big question now is whether Q4 will lead to a sharp drop in sales, or whether there will be a more gradual easing in selling rates. Some kind of slowdown still seems likely, but the final quarter of the year begins with more momentum than seemed probable just a few months ago”.

With nine months of the year now passed, the outlook for 2025 is looking more robust than expected at any point since tariffs became a reality. We remain of the view that there will be a slowdown in selling rates in Q4, but this now appears likely to be more modest than previously thought, and the market is entering Q4 on a stronger footing than expected. In fact, there is now a good chance that Light Vehicle sales will grow YoY, and we have revised up our full-year forecast to 16.0 million units. This would represent a YoY gain of around 0.4%, and would also mark the first time that the 16.0 million unit mark has been surpassed since 2019. There are risks on both sides of the forecast, and much is hanging on the extent to which OEMs can continue to keep pricing in check, in a market in which affordability is still a major concern.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/05/2024-Ford-F-150-Lariat_01.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:38.239318

While an absurdly high-horsepower EV might have always been a niche product, this also likely means Dodge is abandoning its 800-volt architecture upgrade for all Charger EVs. And that’s the only thing that could have given the next generation competitive charging speeds.

The Banshee trim was positioned as Dodge’s new Hellcat

The Mopar Insiders website claims that one of its “trusted supplier sources” spilled the beans on this latest shift at Stellantis. When Dodge first announced the new Charger Daytona EV, it showed off a concept car with a new “Banshee” badge. This high-horsepower trim was supposed to be the brand’s new Hellcat.

Dodge launched the Charger Daytona EV for the 2025 model year. But all the trim levels available only offered a 400-volt architecture. It makes very little sense to build a single model with both architectures, because once you’ve engineered an 800-volt EV, your material costs to produce it aren’t much higher. So I assumed once Dodge finished the Banshee, all future Charger Daytonas would have an 800-volt architecture.

Why 800 volts actually mattered for Dodge

This upgrade wouldn’t just improve electric motor output—it could dramatically improve the charging speed of all the Dodge EVs. That’s why many of the Charger Daytona’s competitors have 800-volt fast charging: Porsche EVs, Lucids, Hyundais, and the Cybertruck. But not older Tesla models, which Dodge would be able to vault ahead of.

In Dodge’s marketing material, it claimed the 400-volt Charger Daytona’s battery would go from 20% to 80% in just over 27 minutes while hooked up to a DC fast charger. When InsideEVs tested the car, it found this took over an hour. The publication even tried a second charger, and speeds were so slow the reviewers gave up after 47 minutes.

When MotorTrend tested the same car, it found it took 72 minutes to get the battery to 100%. Half an hour of charging added just 115 miles of range. When the publication confronted Dodge, the automaker promised an 800-volt architecture for the upcoming SRT trim.

What the future might hold

Here’s to hoping that even with the Banshee dead, Dodge forges ahead with an 800-volt architecture for all its future EVs—whether SRT products or not. Perhaps the next generation of its top-trim muscle cars will be internal combustion after all. But an inexpensive EV with reliable fast charging could be an excellent budget-friendly Dodge.",https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2024-Dodge-Charger-Daytona-SRT-Banshee-EV-concept-Detroits-NAIAS-via-Henry-Cesari-rear.JPG.jpeg?w=1200,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:41.922505

,EPA,2025-10-03 06:25:04+00:00,www.achrnews.com,EPA Proposes New Refrigerant Rule | ACHR News,"Joanna R. Turpin, the University of Washington",,,,,https://www.achrnews.com/articles/165340-epa-proposes-new-refrigerant-rule,"For retail food refrigeration, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold to 1,400 (from 150 or 300), starting in 2026 for remote condensing units and 2027 for supermarket systems.
Both would be followed by a GWP threshold of 150 or 300 GWP starting in 2032.
“With this proposal, EPA is working to make American refrigerants affordable, safe, and reliable again.” Industry Reaction Industry groups are already weighing in on the proposed rule changes.
The group had previously filed a lawsuit over the initial rule, arguing that the timeline for supermarket refrigeration equipment was arbitrary and violated the AIM Act.
In a press release, FMI president and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin praised EPA for reconsidering the TT rule, noting that the original rule imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.","Additionally, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300 to 700 starting January 1, 2026, followed by a GWP limit of 150 or 300 starting in 2032. For retail food refrigeration, EPA is proposing to raise the GWP threshold to 1,400 (from 150 or 300), starting in 2026 for remote condensing units and 2027 for supermarket systems. Both would be followed by a GWP threshold of 150 or 300 GWP starting in 2032.

EPA framed these adjustments as a response to real-world challenges, noting in a press release that the 2023 TT rule “forced companies to switch to specific refrigerants like designer HFC blends for residential air conditioning and ammonia or carbon dioxide for supermarket and cold storage refrigeration equipment, contributing to an increase in consumer costs and shortages.”

The agency added that shortages of HFC blends left families without air conditioning during this summer’s extreme heat.

“Not only has this left Americans unable to afford or access the necessary refrigerants to install critical equipment, but it has also put public safety and human health at risk, as substances like ammonia are more toxic and flammable.”

In addition, with only 15 months’ notice, the EPA’s timeline may not allow safe compliance.

“Hardworking Americans have made their voices and frustrations heard about the lack of availability of refrigerant alternatives during hot summer months and regulations that increase the cost of living for families. Today, the Trump EPA is heeding the call for change,” said Zeldin. “With this proposal, EPA is working to make American refrigerants affordable, safe, and reliable again.”

Industry Reaction

Industry groups are already weighing in on the proposed rule changes. FMI – The Food Industry Association, for example, welcomed the revisions. The group had previously filed a lawsuit over the initial rule, arguing that the timeline for supermarket refrigeration equipment was arbitrary and violated the AIM Act.

In a press release, FMI president and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin praised EPA for reconsidering the TT rule, noting that the original rule imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines. She added that the proposed new rule would balance environmental goals with economic realities.

“This revised proposal is critical to preventing the rule from unnecessarily driving up grocery prices,” she said. “A balanced approach will provide retail stores with additional time to comply and reduce the implementation challenges associated with the rule, including a lack of available technology, continued installation and technician shortages, among other factors.”

The Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors – National Association (PHCC) also expressed support for certain elements of the proposed rule. Chuck White, vice president of regulatory affairs, said PHCC supports eliminating the sell-through period for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump products, calling it a practical solution that avoids the costly problem of stranded inventory.

“Allowing installation of products manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025, will keep consumers from ultimately having to absorb the cost of equipment that was abandoned due to the date on the calendar,” he said. “PHCC will continue to review the other industry-related sections of the proposed EPA reconsideration and prepare comments for the Agency’s consideration.”

The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) is currently reviewing the proposed rule and will also have extensive comments by the deadline, said Samantha Slater, vice president of government affairs. In a press release, AHRI reiterated several of its well-established positions on the existing 2023 rule, including:

Delaying the TT rule transition dates would disrupt multi-year planning and investment by U.S. manufacturers. Companies have already retooled production, certified new equipment, and built supply chains around the current schedule;

Maintaining the current dates avoids duplicative costs, dual inventories, and confusion in the marketplace. Delays would force manufacturers and distributors to manage redundant product lines and training programs;

A delay would re-open the U.S. market to outdated, high-GWP equipment, giving foreign manufacturers a competitive advantage. This would penalize American firms that acted in good faith to comply with the AIM Act;

Certainty under the AIM Act supports stable refrigerant supply, protects domestic jobs, and prevents fragmented state rules. Reopening the rule would invite a patchwork of requirements across jurisdictions; and

Over time, delays would increase costs for manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and end users. Staying on schedule lowers costs, supports investment recovery, and ensures affordable, energy-efficient equipment for consumers.

“As stated many times previously, it’s important to remember that the existing TT rule applies only to newly manufactured equipment,” said Slater. “Existing systems can operate through their full useful life, and components will remain available to ensure that servicing is not disrupted.""

HARDI is also analyzing the impact of the proposed rule, including how it will affect future refrigerant supplies by changing which refrigerants are used in commercial refrigeration, said Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs.

“We want to make sure this rule does not create major shortages in the future by increasing demand for refrigerants with high-GWPs on systems that can last over 25 years.”

Another concern, said Ayers, is that the EPA’s many proposed changes affect deadlines that are just three months away, making it doubtful the rule will be finalized by year’s end and creating uncertainty for distributors.

“The current government shutdown could delay the rule even further, since the Federal Register cannot post the rule to open the comment period until the government reopens, which delays the start of the 45-day comment period.”

Most importantly, Ayers stressed that the proposal is not yet final.

“No legal requirements have changed yet and won’t change until the final rule is released, so we’re asking our members to continue to follow the requirements in place now until the changes are finalized.”",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/10/02/Idaho-condensing-unit.jpg?height=635&t=1759437484&width=1200,N,,2025-10-03 02:58:36.646894

The move comes as Ford CEO warns that Trump policies will further hurt the US EV market

Enchem Co., a South Korean battery materials maker, has scrapped its plan to invest $143 million to build a plant in the US due to the protracted downturn in the world’s third-largest electric vehicle market, industry sources in Seoul said on Wednesday.

Enchem, the world’s No. 4 electrolyte manufacturer, has canceled its plan to spend 200 billion won ($142.7 million) to construct a production base in Tennessee to supply the battery component to BlueOval SK LLC, a joint venture between South Korea’s battery maker SK On Co. and US automaker Ford Motor Co., the sources said.

Enchem had planned to provide electrolytes from the plant to BlueOval SK, but supply deals, which were expected to be signed last year, were repeatedly delayed.

An electrolyte facilitates the movement of ions between the anode and cathode, enabling the battery to charge and discharge by transporting electrical charge in the form of ions, not electrons.

Enchem’s decision came as Ford’s EV business remained sluggish. Ford’s EV division has lost $12 billion in total, including $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025.

US ELIMINATES EV TAX CREDIT

US President Donald Trump’s policies to boost internal combustion engine vehicles also hurt the EV industry. The US administration eliminated the tax credit benefit of up to $7,500 for EV buyers starting this month.

Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said on Wednesday that the elimination and softening of emissions rules will sharply curtail EV demand in the US.

He predicted the share of zero-emission vehicles, which is currently around 10% of the domestic market, could fall by half.

The policies are expected to affect not only the EV industry but also the battery sector.

ALL REVISE US BUSINESS STRATEGIES

BlueOval SK, the total capacity of which is likely to rise to 127 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by next year, is predicted to underutilize its facilities.

“All companies involved in the local EV value chain with Ford are now revising their strategies,” said an industry source in Seoul.

Instead of moving forward with the Tennessee project, Enchem plans to focus its investments on its Georgia facility, which supplies electrolytes to LG Energy Solution Ltd., and its Indiana plant, which serves Samsung SDI Co.

,North Carolina Clean Energy,2025-10-03 05:27:57+00:00,The Cool Down,Experts issue warning on new factor driving up energy prices for all Americans,Daniel Gala,,,,,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/data-center-electricity-bills-increase-bloomberg/,"In 2023, data centers consumed 4.4% of all electricity produced in the U.S., according to a Department of Energy study.
The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.
How often do you worry about your energy bills?
If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse.
With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast.","A new analysis by Bloomberg has uncovered the extraordinary impact that power-hungry data centers already have had on the electricity bills of millions of ordinary Americans, and the news is not good.

Over the past five years, Americans who live in areas near data centers have seen their electricity bills increase by as much as 267%, Bloomberg found.

""It's killing my pockets,"" said Antoinette Robinson, a resident of East Baltimore, Maryland, per Bloomberg.

What's happening?

As massive new data centers used to power artificial-intelligence models and cloud computing have sprouted up across the U.S. and around the world, they have consumed larger and larger amounts of electricity, outpacing new sources of electricity production.

According to basic economic principles, when demand goes up faster than supply, prices increase. As a result, millions of Americans, many of whom already were struggling to make ends meet, have seen their electric bills skyrocket.

""Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,"" said David Crane, the CEO of Generate Capital, per Bloomberg. Crane warned the strain on power supplies in certain markets could result in brownouts as soon as the next year or two.

In 2023, data centers consumed 4.4% of all electricity produced in the U.S., according to a Department of Energy study. The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.

By way of comparison, in 2019, the entire country of Canada consumed a total of 530 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. That year, Canada ranked sixth out of all nations in terms of energy consumption.

Why does data-center power consumption matter?

While many experts have warned of the coming data-center power crunch, Bloomberg's analysis has shown that, for many Americans, the electricity shortages have already become a harsh economic reality.

Nicole Pastore, who has seen her own electricity costs go up by 50% in just the past year, serves as a judge overseeing rental disputes in Baltimore. In that capacity, she has observed firsthand the impact that skyrocketing power prices have had on many of the city's most vulnerable residents.

How often do you worry about your energy bills?

Every day 😥

A few times a week 😟

A few times a month 🙁

Only when I pay it 😬

Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.

""It's utilities versus rent,"" Pastore explained, per Bloomberg. ""They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.""

Many hard-hit residents wonder why they should have to, in effect, subsidize the country's AI boom, while already-wealthy tech companies rake in the resulting profits.

""They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?"" asked Kevin Stanley, an East Baltimore resident who is unable to work because of his glaucoma, according to Bloomberg. ""How's that going to help me pay my bill?""

What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?

If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse. As tech companies in the U.S. race to keep pace in the fierce competition to dominate artificial intelligence, even more massive — and more power-hungry — data centers are in the works.

With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast. Meanwhile, policymakers could force tech companies to pay more for their own energy use and the strain they place on power grids, rather than pushing those costs onto consumers.

Unfortunately, recent policy changes have turned the U.S. away from cleaner, renewable sources of energy and toward dirtier, extracted fuels, which has hurt both the prospects for new electricity production and the environment.

According to S&P Global, the worldwide waiting list for the turbines used in gas-fueled power plants is currently seven years long, not nearly fast enough to meet rising demand.

By comparison, renewable-energy facilities such as solar arrays and wind farms can be brought online much more quickly and at much lower environmental costs.

To make a difference, you can help push for a return to policies that favor cleaner, renewable-energy production by contacting your elected representatives and voting for candidates who share your energy priorities.

Additionally, by installing solar panels on your home, you can drop your own electricity bill to practically zero while also reducing demand on already-maxed-out power grids.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/data-center-electricity-billsimage-recD51onMTapKBkD8-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:37.401576

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill.
After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day.
The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.
Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities.","The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states — but is allowing funding to continue for similar projects in states that voted for Trump.

The canceled grants, which were first announced by the Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, on Wednesday, don’t total anywhere close to all of the energy investments made by the Biden administration, which Vought called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

For now, energy project money appears to be continuing to flow to companies and institutions located in red and swing states, even though the work these institutions are doing is very similar to the work that was cut, according to a NOTUS analysis of hundreds of projects across the country, including the latest cancellations.

For example, the administration canceled $460 million in funding for the Democrat-led state of Minnesota to build much-needed interregional transmission lines (power lines that connect the country’s separated parts of the grid).

It left in place a $700 million grant from the same program that will connect the eastern and western U.S. grids in Montana, a state that voted for Trump and is led by Republicans.

The administration also canceled funding to improve the resilience of the power grid in Hawaii from wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as $40 million in funding for a project to build a resilient backup microgrid for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and the island of Oahu.

It did not cut the $160 million that was awarded in the same funding round from the same program for Georgia Power to make the state’s electric grid more resilient.

And of the 17 projects the Department of Energy awarded for battery recycling and reprocessing innovations, the list of cuts included just three: one in Colorado and two in California. There’s no obvious difference between those three projects and the remaining 14 that appear to still be funded, beyond the fact that some of the others are located at national labs or in states that either voted for Trump or are led by Republicans, like Utah, Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

And while the administration canceled billions in funding for hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, hubs that touch states including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana appear fine for now.

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill. There is discussion on the Hill between some Democrats and Republicans in the states affected by the cuts about pushing for a restoration of the funds as part of a deal to end the shutdown, one source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested as much to Fox News on Thursday when asked about the program cuts.

“Pass the clean, continuing resolution and all of this goes away,” she said, directed at Democrats.

But just hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that a reversal of the cuts was not on the table. In an interview on CNN Thursday night, he said that the decision to cancel the funding had nothing to do with the shutdown.

When asked about why the affected projects were all in states that voted for Kamala Harris last November, Wright denied that the administration was targeting Democrats and said that more cancellations were coming down the pipe — including in red states. “This is a partial list of an ongoing process. More project announcements will come,” he said.

The Trump administration’s announcement sowed confusion for the companies and states affected. After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day. Some local authorities said they have still not received official notice from the DOE, including the state of Colorado and the California Energy Commission.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said he had lunch with Energy Secretary Chris Wright “minutes before” the cancellations were announced, but received no warning.

“He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included 10 projects in my state, projects that affect real jobs and real families,” Heinrich said in a statement. “That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions.”

The grant cancellations span projects aimed to improve electrical grid infrastructure, innovate on battery recycling, create new forms of energy storage, lower buildings’ energy usage and advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Many of the projects would carry benefits and jobs outside of the states they are based in, especially those that would affect the resilience and performance of the nation’s aging electric grid.

A number of recipients are losing multiple projects, including some institutions whose goals could serve the Trump administration’s interests. GTI Energy, which is focused on modernizing the natural gas industry, lost 13 grants. Both GE Vernova, a maker of wind and gas turbines, and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit electricity research organization, lost 11. The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.

Many of the projects on this list have already begun operations, which means the money that has been distributed for these projects so far will be wasted if operations halt, another source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

Lindsay VanLaningham, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a community-owned electric utility, said in a statement to NOTUS that as of Thursday evening, the DOE had not yet notified them of any changes to their grant, which funds “a portion of a project already in flight.”

Some of the canceled awards are listed by the Energy Department as targeting blue states, but the impacted projects themselves are located in red states. For instance, a $19.7 million federal award to IBM related to methane emissions research is categorized under awards cancelled to entities New York — but a description of the project published in 2024 said it will be carried out entirely in western states that voted for Trump, including Utah, Montana and Alaska.

There are more areas for confusion: The list of cancellations includes some, but not all, grants that the DOE first announced in May that it was canceling, primarily for clean energy industrial demonstrations.

And some of the affected entities are getting information that conflicts from the DOE press release. The department says entities have 30 days to appeal the cancellations, but one affected group told NOTUS their instructions say they only have 10 days to appeal.

Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities. For example, the administration has issued executive orders and memos emphasizing the importance of mineral development and extraction in the United States. Recycling used batteries is one way to increase the availability of minerals and metals like lithium, but three of the grants in that program have been axed.

Some companies have confirmed with NOTUS that they are now receiving cancellation notices. Those include Smartville, a California-based company that was building a long-duration battery storage project, and Sublime Systems, which was originally told in May its grants had been cancelled and has been in the appeals process since then.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/c4c6a33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5096x2867+0+265/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2Ff8%2Fa8e94e18431c9f708b764478d761%2Fap25169565568734.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:42.389500

The new station is located at Sheetz in Pittsburgh on Freeport Road along Interstate 76 (Exit 48).

Since the first NEVI-funded station opened in PA, the charging stations have delivered more than 30,000 charging sessions, powering over 3.5 million estimated miles driven and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1.7 million pounds (or 750 metric tons).

Additionally, PennDOT announced that it is the first state to receive a Full Build-Out Certification under the new federal NEVI guidance issued in August. The build-out certification allows a state to move beyond the initial phase of the NEVI program that focused on building charging stations on the core network of interstate highways, enabling PennDOT to begin the next stage of the NEVI program — Corridor Connections(opens in a new tab) — which will be released on or before October 7, 2025.

“Thanks to our team’s diligent work in 2023 and 2024, and Governor Shapiro’s persistent efforts to secure Congressionally appropriated funding, we’re in a position to continue making EVs more accessible for PA travelers,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. ""That quick action ensured Pennsylvania could adapt to national program changes while locking in investments for Pennsylvania.""

Per NEVI guidance issued August 11, PennDOT submitted an updated Pennsylvania NEVI State Plan(opens in a new tab) and a second request for Full Build-Out Certification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on August 27, 2025. The next phase will begin projects that connect communities. The NEVI State Plan was approved on September 5, 2025, and PennDOT received Full Build-Out Certification on September 22, 2025. Having received approval, the Shapiro Administration is moving forward with the community phase of the NEVI program, beginning with the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity.

The Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity(opens in a new tab) focuses on implementing EV charging stations along major roadways to strengthen long-distance travel outside of previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors(opens in a new tab). These locations are expected to serve the communities and regions near the charging station locations. Projects funded from the Corridor Connections program will improve range confidence for drivers who are considering travel with an EV across and throughout the Commonwealth.

PennDOT anticipates soliciting about 24 projects through the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity, with up to $20 million in available funding. The Funding Opportunity is expected to include more than 1,000 miles of roadway and incorporate sections of:

Luke Harris is an op-ed author who writes about the US, UK, and international politics, policy, and culture.","As he struggled again to say “acetaminophen,” and asked someone off camera, “Is that OK?” when he finally managed to get his lips around the word, the moment was a perfect encapsulation of the dumbing down of expertise and the political corruption of science under this administration.

He said that taking acetaminophen, or Tylenol, while pregnant has been associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” a claim pushed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy with little to no basis in scientific fact.

“Taking Tylenol is not good,” Trump declared, as if anyone in their right mind would take medical advice from a guy who suggested injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus.

Scientists — people who, unlike Trump and Kennedy, have actual expertise in these matters — objected. Dr. Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University called the announcement “appalling” and “a very significant distortion” of what science says about any possible links.

The Coalition of Autism Scientists said: “The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”

And Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia, said, “The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism.”

The absurdity of Trump and Kennedy doling out medical advice, when the former promoted taking anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine to ward off COVID-19 — and then contracted COVID-19 himself — and the latter believes chemicals in drinking water can make someone gay or trans, should not be lost on anyone.

Everyone should ignore these crackpot Looney Tunes and trust their doctors and pediatricians, not two politicians cosplaying at science, whose long and sordid history of bad advice could lead to serious injury or death.

And while MAGA-world usually falls in line quickly to defend even Trump’s worst impulses — see Jan. 6, see Russia, see tariffs — this time Tweedledum and Tweedledee aren’t getting quite the support they’re used to. That’s how bad this is.

Less than a day after Trump made his announcement, his own administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz, went on MAGA favorite Fox News to walk it back.

“So the message is not, ‘Never take Tylenol,’ ” he said, contradicting Trump’s own words. “It’s, ‘Take Tylenol judiciously.’ Take it by talking with your doctor.”

Also on Fox, the network’s own senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel asked and answered the question pretty definitively. “Does acetaminophen during pregnancy cause autism? People out there need to know there’s absolutely no proof whatsoever that that’s the case.”

In Congress, there’s been some rare pushback, too. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN he was “very concerned” and insisted, “science ought to guide these discussions.”

Sen. Bill Cassidy, a licensed physician, posted on X, “HHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim. The preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.”

And Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal blasted Trump and Kennedy’s anti-Tylenol campaign, pointing to lawsuits against the maker of Tylenol and what may be personal interests in those outcomes.

“What’s going on here has less to do with healthcare than with a campaign by the plaintiffs bar,” wrote the Journal’s editorial board. “If a drug company made the unproven claims aired at the White House, the Food and Drug Administration would threaten legal action.”

“So why the sudden alarm, complete with a presidential presser?” it continued. “The Occam’s razor answer is the influence of RFK Jr., who is carrying water for his friends in the plaintiffs bar. A who’s-who of lawsuit shops are pushing the Tylenol-autism link in federal court. The transparent goal is to drum up more claims to drive a bigger damage award or settlement.”

I’m not even sure Trump believes all of the garbage he spewed on Monday. In his inimitable way, he seemed to distance himself from what he was selling, saying, “This is based on what I feel,” and “You know, I’m making these statements from me, I’m not making them from these doctors,” and “I’m not a doctor, but I’m giving my opinion.”

So when asked if it was appropriate for him to tell the public what to do, given it was based on his “feelings,” he answered it was “absolutely appropriate.”

Chef’s kiss.

Representative Democracy is a form of self-governing; our Constitution delineates a set of values and principles that evolve and materialize as Americans exercise their rights to challenge societal norms and create legal and social change. The Democratic state produces the circumstances that provide the greatest freedoms, such that they are consistent with equality under the law: the liberties to freely express one’s ideas, vote in open elections to decide the politicians who will represent our diverse interests, and defend against leaders or citizens who endanger these freedoms. The current hyperpolarization, apathy, and extremism are incompatible with the preservation of these freedoms and the protection of our country. This is the deleterious effect of the failure of our educational and scientific institutions.

Liberalism is curring the flamer, sniffy, childhood-enduring preconceptions, and unthoughtful, or unchallenged beliefs—the ideas and attitudes that provide the easiest answers, but often perpetuate in collective thinking, and social pressure; the accountability of schools—in K-12, and higher education—to teach students how to think critically; preparing citizens of a democracy, with any level of education, to synthesize information and form their opinions independent of group identity or ideology. However, my teachers taught critical thinking as an intellectual skill and did not properly acknowledge or instill its value. The consequence of learning to think independently and reexamine yourself, your thoughts, and your beliefs should be uncomfortable; it can be linked to losing your social/self-identity, questioning your faith or secular-moral values, and often facing disapproval from your parents and friends. The issue is exacerbated in higher education, where there is social pressure to think in a certain way, and professors continue to teach students what to think, rather than how to think.

Furthermore, the conversation needs to include everyone. Someone with a thought disorder, people who are prone to emotional outbursts, have social or communication challenges, or have lower intelligence, or learning disabilities, are being excluded from these conversations. If someone does not have the words to express their ideas, whatever they can say could direct the group to new ways of thinking; if someone is mentally disabled, they may change how people talk with each other, and bring a different emotional attitude. However, if the person is not intelligent or they are harder to speak with, we are denying them entry into these types of discussions where they can provide value. Personally, in early elementary school, I had many of these problems. My experience is different; I make connections more fluidly, I have less linear thinking, but I can present as neurotypical and intelligent. People will listen and consider what I have to say, but someone who cannot communicate as clearly or is harder to talk with does not receive the same respect. The consequence is reinforcing the same ideas and providing only one way to think.

The scientific community is responsible for engaging in public discourse, making their discoveries and ideas accessible to the public, and honestly discussing criticisms and challenges to their work, which includes spotlighting different public figures in their field. If topics or theories are backed by strong empirical evidence, then scientists should denounce and criticize the merits, character, and fitness of those people presenting unbacked science or dangerous assertions. However, consistent appeals to authority and consensus are a strong indication that members of the scientific community are succumbing to social pressure or represent a homogenous intellectual class. The contributions of science are essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy. For this reason, classicist-collectivist behavior across various fields of research is concerning and also symptomatic of educational institutions that have failed to effectively instill the values and skills discussed above—those most essential for serious inquiry.

Democracy is unsustainable and short-lasting when there are severe restrictions on freedom of expression. The highest form of expression is holding your representatives accountable to your interests, both by speaking loudly and voting out incumbents when they are dishonest, unresponsive, and unrepresentative of their constituents. In any democracy where the party convention suppresses contest and does not put forth any alternative options, it is necessary to vote against party lines, because elected officials who are assured of their reelection are no longer accountable to represent the interests of their constituents. There is contention in democracies about the extent of acceptable speech. The line for the strongest advocates is often hate speech, and the debate about the function and benefits of hate speech should remain lively. However, there is a strong argument that protecting hate is necessary for remaining vigilant and aware of the dangerous fringes and movements within a democracy.

The excursions into democratic governing have not proven to be sustainable in the long term. This form of government is the freest and rests on the maintenance and continuance of the freedoms it provides—these freedoms and the institutions, such as schools, and the scientific establishment, serve specific purposes that both represent what democracy is, why democracy is the most befitting to the protection of human dignity, and justice, and the factors that determine how well and how long any democracy will function. The first step forward is understanding that polarization is the consequence, not the cause. The extreme polarization tearing our country apart is the consequence of our failing educational and scientific institutions.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules that it says can’t be justified.","The Trump administration is canceling $7.6 billion in grants that supported clean energy projects in 16 states — including Colorado, where more than $550 million in funding is set to be eliminated in what the state decried as “politically motivated targeting.”

The U.S. Department of Energy said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated nationwide after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable.

Twenty entities in Colorado were on that list, including the University of Colorado, Colorado School of Mines, Tri-State Generation and Transmission, businesses dedicated to emissions reductions such as solar companies, and nonprofits that promote clean energy — including one that works with Indian tribes on clean energy projects.

The largest chunk of money being stripped involves $326 million for Colorado State University’s research toward reducing methane, a potent planet-warming gas, from oil and gas wells, The New York Times reported.

Two Colorado Energy Office grants that are targeted would provide $5 million to support programs that improve energy efficiency and cut carbon emissions from buildings.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown. Most of the projects being terminated were budgeted for states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election and have Democratic governors and senators.

Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, said in a written statement that the office had not formally received any official federal notices of termination, but understood that two of its projects were on the list, “which specifically targets states where a majority of Americans cast their votes in favor of the Democratic nominee for president.”

“This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution and create instability in our business community,” Rosenblum said.

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Aurora, accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the federal government to punish people who did not vote for him.

“This spiteful and cruel decision will raise energy bills and mean the loss of good-paying jobs in Colorado,” Crow said in a statement. “We will not kiss the ring of a wannabe king. This blatant intimidation and act of retribution is illegal.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is from Colorado and is the founder of Denver-based Liberty Energy, an oilfield services company, said in a news release that his department had been reviewing financial awards since he was appointed by Trump and was attempting to trim waste.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” said Wright, who has opposed any efforts to combat climate change. “Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The Energy Department did not respond to The Denver Post’s request for an interview with Wright.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”

The elimination of hundreds of grants is likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules that it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health.

Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

QBE insurance companies are rated ""A"" (Excellent) by A.M. Best and ""A+"" by Standard & Poor's.","The advertising landscape has fundamentally shifted as brands redirect their marketing dollars from traditional media to where consumers spend their time: social media platforms. This transformation has created a new economy of social media influencers, ranging from those earning modest side income to multi-millionaire content creators who command global audiences.

However, this rapidly growing sector presents unique challenges that traditional insurance products weren’t designed to address. As influencer partnerships become more sophisticated and widespread, both creators and the brands that hire them face potential liability exposures that can result in significant financial consequences.

The Rise of the Influencer Economy

The financial potential in influencer marketing spans an enormous range. “There’s a huge range in influencer revenue. At the top end, you have celebrity influencers earning millions of dollars. At the other end, it’s people with just a thousand followers who might earn very little money,” said Chris Cooper, SVP, U.S. Head of Media & Professions at QBE North America.

“In the middle, are influencers who typically represent the greatest risk and opportunity. These are influencers who earn tens of thousands of dollars per year. This demographic represents creators who have moved beyond hobbyist status but haven’t yet reached the level where they employ business managers or have sophisticated risk management strategies.”

The shift in advertising spending reflects broader consumer behavior changes. “Advertising dollars have shifted from traditional print media, digital banners, and TV commercials to platforms where people’s eyes are—primarily social media,” Cooper said. “A lot of this advertising comes in the form of sponsored reviews or influencers talking about their experiences with products and how the items have helped in their daily lives.”

Emerging Liability Risks in Influencer Marketing

The authentic, personal nature of influencer content that makes it effective also creates unique liability exposures. Unlike traditional advertising, which goes through multiple layers of legal review, influencer content is often created quickly by individuals who may not understand the legal implications of their posts.

Cooper explained how QBE became aware of this growing problem: “We’re a traditional media liability insurer that has been in this space since 2013 in North America and longer elsewhere in the world. We insure companies that are in the business of creating and disseminating content against exposures like copyright infringement, defamation, invasion of privacy, false light, and right of publicity.”

QBE’s existing relationships with specialized law firms revealed a growing trend. “We work with many law firms specializing in advertising law, copyright law, and defamation that started informing us they were defending non-media companies for claims arising from content created by small or midsize influencers who had made mistakes,” Cooper said.

The financial burden of these mistakes often falls on the brands rather than the influencers themselves. “Because these influencers typically didn’t have insurance or sufficient assets, the larger brands that hired them ended up bearing the entire burden from a claims payment, claims handling, and defense counsel perspective,” he said.

One particularly common issue involves music licensing. “We’ve seen numerous slip-ups by influencers and brands where they’ve allowed music to play in the background of content,” Cooper said. “Even something as simple as having music playing in the background while recording promotional content for a brand would constitute potential copyright infringement without a proper synchronization license.”

The distinction between personal and commercial use creates additional complexity. “Most platforms have blanket synchronization licensing agreements with music publishers, but these are strictly for personal use,” Cooper explained. “However, once content shifts to advertising and commercial purposes, the available music library narrows significantly. There’s a fine line between when an influencer is posting personally versus commercially, and many aren’t aware of this distinction.”

The timing of legal intervention also affects outcomes. “The law firms told us they were getting cases very late in the process, hurting both the brand and influencer’s chances of successfully defending their cases,” Cooper said.

QBE’s Specialized Solution for Influencer Media Liability

Drawing on its decade-plus experience in traditional media liability coverage, QBE developed a targeted solution, The Influencer by QBE, that addresses the specific challenges brands face when working with influencers. The approach combines education, insurance coverage, and streamlined claims management.

“Rather than simply writing policies for every influencer, we created a product addressing the core problem our larger insureds were facing,” Cooper said. “This product recognizes that even companies with existing media liability policies face challenges with influencer-related claims due to high deductibles and coverage gaps.”

Education forms a cornerstone of QBE’s approach. “We really leaned into that educational aspect by creating a short learning module. A 30-minute video covers the major topics influencers need to watch out for, followed by a short quiz,” Cooper said. “The video covers essential areas of media and advertising law that influencers need to understand from copyright and trademark to defamation and right of publicity.”

The insurance coverage itself reflects the unique structure of influencer partnerships. “The policy covers both the brand and the influencer, but solely for the actions of the influencer,” Cooper explained. “This isn’t meant to replace a larger media liability or Errors & Omissions policy for a large company. It’s designed to address that specific influencer-related problem we kept hearing about.”

The coverage structure aligns with how influencer campaigns typically operate and provides dedicated coverage for each campaign. “Influencers are typically hired for specific campaigns with contractual obligations. For example, they might be contracted to create 20 posts about a lavender latte. Then they might get another contract for 10 posts about a pumpkin spice latte,” Cooper said. “We’ve set an occurrence-based $250K limit for each of those contracts.”

The Influencer launched in mid-August 2025 and is distributed through brokers who can manage the process of getting influencers signed up with the training and coverage. “The brand and broker can direct influencers to our dedicated web page where they provide basic information and complete the required training,” Cooper explained.

Looking ahead, the scale of influencer marketing continues to expand. “Some brands and large companies work with thousands of influencers,” Cooper said. “As this market grows, specialized risk management solutions become increasingly critical for protecting both creators and the brands that partner with them.”

The motion said that if a stay is granted in cases that make a variety of challenges to the Renewable Fuel Standard, then government counsel would notify the court when funds are restored.

""Therefore, although we greatly regret any disruption caused to the court and the other litigants, the government hereby moves for an abeyance of these consolidated cases until Department of Justice attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions,"" the motion said.

One refiner petitioner, Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc., owned by Delek U.S. Holdings Inc., filed a motion with the DC Circuit Court the same day of the EPA motion, opposing holding that case in abeyance.

""To begin with, there is no legal impediment to EPA meeting its deadlines,"" the company said.

""As DOJ's plan recognizes, if a court denies a request for a stay, 'the government will comply with the court's order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.'""

The DC Circuit Court announced on Wednesday that it ""will continue normal operations"" during the shutdown and that ""parties remain obligated to meet all scheduled deadlines for filing.""

The company said the court had ""materially identical contingency plans"" during shutdowns in 2013 and 2019.

""So, absent agreement from the parties, the court did not grant 'a single motion seeking a stay' of oral argument 'during the 2013 shutdown' and extended the 'same' 'practice' to motions to stay briefing during the 2019 shutdown,"" the company said.

In a lawsuit filed by Clean Fuels Alliance and Growth Energy against the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, so far the agency has not asked the court to place that litigation in abeyance.

In that case the groups sued to press the agency to finalize Renewable Fuel Standard volumes. The groups told that court that all sides could reach a consent decree in the case to finalize the latest RFS volumes by Dec. 31, 2025.

Well, maybe.

The electric vehicle maker run by Musk reported Thursday that car sales jumped 7% in the three months through September after plunging for most of the year as people turned off by his embrace of President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe balked at buying his cars.

But the jump comes with a caveat: Tesla benefited from consumers taking advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30, a surge in buying that helped all EV makers.

In fact, many Tesla rivals saw sales rise more. Rivian Automotive reported a 32% increase.

Tesla stock rose sharply on the sales news, but closed the day down 4.5% to $439 amid skepticism the new number really signals a turnaround given all the anti-Musk backlash.

“I don’t think most people are any more enamored with Elon now than they were a few months ago,"" said Telemetry Insight's Sam Abuelsamid. ""I expect this is more a blip for Tesla than the restart of growth.”

Even Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities was cautious, noting there are ""still demand issues.”

Still, it was a blowout number with sales hitting 497,099 vehicles versus 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected a small drop to 456,000.

Investors cheered Musk’s decision in April to leave Washington for Austin, Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. But he is still heavily involved in political and social wars, alienating potential car buyers.

On Wednesday, he posted on X that he was canceling his Netflix subscription because of critical comments made by the creator of a show on the streaming service, which appeared to spark a wave of cancellations in turn.

The sharp fall in Tesla stock Thursday was remarkable as investors have been surprisingly optimistic about the company in recent weeks despite terrible financial figures.

Investors drove the stock up 34% in September alone in a bet that Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. Musk has also been successful in shifting investor attention away from cars to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

Driving the stock higher has also been Musk’s apparent renewed focus on the company.

To hold his attention, Tesla's board proposed last month a pay package that would allow Musk to earn $1 trillion if he meets certain financial goals over the next several years. The pay offer, unprecedented for U.S. companies known for outsized CEO compensation, drew criticism from Pope Leo in an interview lamenting widening income gaps.

If Musk meets the goals, he could set a record on top of his own record. He recently became the first person ever to hit $500 billion in net worth, at least according to rich list compiler Forbes magazine.

The 7% sales rise in the last quarter compares with a 13% dropped in the first three months of the year when Musk led Trump's government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales plunged 13% again.

The anti-Musk backlash in Europe had been also been fierce. Sales plunged 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Musk said a British prime minister was an ""evil tyrant"" who belongs in prison and told Germans ""things will get very, very much worse"" in their country if they didn't vote for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. Protests broke out in several cities, including a hanging of the billionaire in effigy in Milan and posters in London likening him to a Nazi.

For her part, the Tesla head of the board of directors who approved Musk’s latest pay package recently told Bloomberg that she is not sure if Musk’s politics have had any impact on the company’s finances. Robyn Denholm has earned nearly $700 million in compensation for serving on the board since 2014, a package that itself has drawn criticism.

Tesla reports third-quarter earnings later this month. Profits for the previous quarter fell 16% as the company continued to lose market share to European EV makers and fast-growing Chinese rivals, such as BYD.

Musk's new robotaxi service, which began with a test-run in Austin in June, has had some hitches with reports of the cabs stopping suddenly for no reason and even driving in the opposing lane in one instance. But Musk says the service will quickly roll out anyway with launches in several other cities by the end of next year.

According to Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, the U.S. Department of Energy will axe $8 billion worth of energy projects, including nearly $450 million in federal grants for clean energy and grid improvement projects in Oregon. The Energy Department stated that the grants did not meet the ""economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.""

According to the list, this includes about 19 awards in Oregon, including to recipients such as Portland General Electric, Warm Springs Power Enterprises and Daimler Truck North America.

Those canceled projects include upgrades to the electric grid, transmission, clean technology manufacturing, energy efficiency, charging infrastructure and workforce development, according to Climate Solutions, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Advocates and officials particularly highlighted the loss of $1 billion in funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub. The Biden administration had announced seven ""hydrogen hubs"" across the U.S. back in 2023, saying that they would help the country move away from fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gases.

Said hubs were to be made up of local governments, businesses, labor groups and researchers, to help develop, produce and distribute hydrogen fuels in a regional network that included Oregon, Washington state and Montana. The Northwest Hub, according to the Energy Department at the time, would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 million metric tons per year — or the equivalent of the emissions of more than five million passenger cars — as well as create over 10,000 jobs.

Hydrogen has been touted as a greener alterative for parts of the economy that are hard to electrify, like heavy industry, trucking, and the manufacture of carbon-intensive materials, like concrete and steel.

""PNWH2 will continue to support our project and industry partners that have laid the foundation for a thriving hydrogen ecosystem throughout the Pacific Northwest,"" said the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, in part. ""With or without federal support, this industry will continue to drive the innovation and infrastructure needed to fortify America’s energy economy.""

Many warned that the cancelations will kneecap revamping of the electric grid amid higher energy needs, and end up costing ratepayers more money.

""Let’s be clear-eyed about the impact of this latest action by the federal government: it hurts our state’s ability to modernize our outdated electric grid and meet today's rising energy demands with affordable clean energy, and Oregon families and businesses will be stuck with paying the tab,"" said Nora Apter, Oregon director of Climate Solutions.

Director Janine Benner of the Oregon Department of Energy called the move ""a significant setback.""

“Between these actions, various supply chain issues, tariffs on components, and federal agencies halting permitting even for projects not on federal lands, the federal government is making choices that may threaten reliability and will certainly increase costs for ratepayers,” Benner stated.

Gov. Tina Kotek, in a statement, said the administration's reversal ""is not shocking,"" calling it ""the latest disappointment in the President’s history of prioritizing political posturing over the future we desperately need to build.""

Washington state officials also condemned the general government's action, saying it terminates more than $1.1 billion from the state's 11 federally funded energy projects across five counties, the grants having already been awarded by Congress.

Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson said that they are working with the attorney general to ""fight this illegal action.""

States that are affected include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

It is National Drive Electric Month but Oregon drivers who do not own electric vehicles face a setback, as federal tax credits expire Tuesday for buying an EV.

The credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used models are ending early under the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Oregon has a burgeoning EV industry, with one of the highest rates of EV drivers per capita in the country. The bill also scrapped federal fuel economy standards.

Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director for the advocacy group Plug In America, said the credits and standards have been a driving force in the transition away from gasoline vehicles.

“The policy changes that we’re seeing are largely going to undermine industrial progress in the United States,” Malmgren contended. “Particularly in battery manufacturing, clean energy manufacturing and automotive manufacturing.”

Investments in EV manufacturing have created more than 230,000 new jobs across the U.S. so far, according to Plug In America. Opponents of the EV tax credits said they have been costly and ineffective.

Malmgren pointed out more than one in four new vehicles sold around the world is electric, and the number is likely to increase. She argued rolling back clean vehicle standards and incentives puts the U.S. at a disadvantage globally.

“We are not going to be leaders in this space,” Malmgren cautioned. “We are going to lose out on technological innovations and we are going to have to watch the rest of the world move forward and possibly be buying our vehicles from other countries.”

Despite the challenging policy environment, Malmgren believes the shift to EVs is inevitable.

“They’re just superior vehicles,” Malmgren asserted. “They’re quick, they’re clean, they’re quiet. They offer so many benefits over gas vehicles.”

Oregon has also had some state tax credits for buying EVs but the Standard Rebate expired Sept. 8. Lower-income drivers can still apply for what’s known as a “Charge Ahead” rebate.",https://kyaq.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ev_charging.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 02:58:06.993896

Much of that capacity is clustering in Southeast Asia, not in Detroit or Chongqing.
In 2024, the White House raised the tariff rate on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent, with additional hikes on batteries and other inputs.
Brussels raised duties on Chinese EVs in late 2024 and has been haggling ever since over price floors and adjustments.
Southeast Asia is building that base right now.","Last month, BYD loaded 959 Thailand-built electric cars onto a carrier bound for Europe. The shipments left Rayong as Brussels kept tariffs on China-made EVs and explored price-floor talks with Beijing. The message here is simple. Production is moving to where policy and logistics make the maths work, and Southeast Asia is already on the route map.

Tariffs can wall off markets, but they cannot conjure supply chains. The United States can add a 100 per cent duty on Chinese electric vehicles and still find itself short of the parts that actually build cars. Motors roll on bearings. Battery packs need anode material and precision castings. Much of that capacity is clustering in Southeast Asia, not in Detroit or Chongqing. If Washington wants cheaper, faster electrification, it should build origin-cumulation corridors with Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which are basically agreements that let the value added across the participating countries be counted together under rules of origin and verified quickly. This way, the system rewards speed and auditability, not just domestic content targets. The alternative is to pay more and wait longer.

If the goal is resilience, the next step is to secure trusted capacity where it already exists or is scaling fast.

Start with the tariffs. In 2024, the White House raised the tariff rate on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent, with additional hikes on batteries and other inputs. Those measures were justified as a shield against subsidised overcapacity. They do not change the simple arithmetic that US brands still depend on non-Chinese, non-US nodes for key components. If the goal is resilience, the next step is to secure trusted capacity where it already exists or is scaling fast.

Thailand is the obvious anchor. It is the region’s auto hub, now flipping hard into electrification with new Board of Investment programs and a steady run of battery and EV announcements. The BOI’s incentives extend corporate tax holidays and export flexibility that have lured global pack makers (multinational battery firms that assemble cells into modules and packs used in EVs), including a billion-dollar cell plant that cleared approvals in 2025. In March 2025, Thailand formally approved more than US$1 billion of battery-cell investment by China’s Sunwoda, underscoring the scale and speed of the shift. Even after a soft year for output, Thailand is exporting EVs and attracting Japanese and Chinese capital for next-gen lines. This is a base that can supply US assembly lines with audited parts at scale.

Malaysia is the precision shop floor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Its automotive ecosystem spans metal stamping, die casting, heat treatment, and machining, and it feeds regional vehicle programs with cast housings, hubs, and other high tolerance parts. The same supplier base that outfits vehicle platforms and industrial equipment can qualify bearings and machined components for North American lines, provided documentation is clean and lead times are contractual. Policymakers should recognise that documentation quality is as infrastructure-critical as a bridge.

Indonesia closes the triangle with minerals and mid-stream battery materials. The country now accounts for roughly half of global mined nickel and is adding capacity in anodes and cathode precursors, while large cell projects proceed towards commissioning. A durable US EV strategy needs a pathway to treat these inputs as “friendly” when they are processed and packed within ASEAN, with high-visibility audit trails. The point is not to import more risk, but to import time.

Europe’s own tariff moves underline the reality. Brussels raised duties on Chinese EVs in late 2024 and has been haggling ever since over price floors and adjustments. The message for Washington is clear. Everyone is trying to rebalance, but no one can decarbonise by decree. The winners will be the blocs that replace ideology with logistics.

Here is what to do.

First, negotiate “cumulation corridors” with Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia that allow parts to earn preferential treatment if value is added within the corridor and if suppliers meet digital audit standards. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership already provides a regional rules-of-origin backbone and a customs facilitation chapter. Use that legal plumbing to bolt on US standards for traceability, sample testing, and ruling timelines. Do not wait for an omnibus deal. Start with a corridor memorandum of understanding and publish the product-specific rules and harmonised system codes that qualify.

EVs are systems, not slogans. Systems thrive on uptime.

Second, make speed a policy variable. Set guaranteed determination windows for origin rulings and create a green-lane for certified suppliers so documentation moves at production tempo during tariff churn. That reduces working capital trapped at ports and cuts the hidden consumer tax of delays.

Third, co-fund metrology and failure-analysis labs in Kuala Lumpur, Rayong, and Batam so small-to-medium enterprises can qualify to US auto standards without six-month queues. A dollar spent on paperwork quality can save ten on inventory.

Finally, match incentives to auditability. The United States already ties credits to content. Go further and bonus what can be verified quickly. Require live dashboards for corridor shipments so buyers can see origin, transformation steps, and lab results in one view. Publish monthly stats on ruling times and exceptions. When suppliers know that clean paperwork is a revenue driver, they will build for it.

This is not a plea to offshore the energy transition. It is an admission that EVs are systems, not slogans. Systems thrive on uptime. With Europe tightening, China retaliating, and US automakers still climbing the battery learning curve, the smart bet is to lock in a nearby, non-Chinese, rules-compliant base for the parts that make cars move. Southeast Asia is building that base right now. America should meet it halfway, and quickly.",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/BYD%20shipment%20comp.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 03:58:46.884888

Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association - serving WA, ID, MT, & OR -- loses around $1 billion in federal funding, potentially curtailing billions in private sector clean energy investments & 10k+ jobs throughout region

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2) is one of the projects targeted by the Trump Administration’s short-sighted, partisan funding cuts the White House Office of Management and Budget announced last night. The PNWH2 supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. Its cancellation will eliminate more than 10,000 jobs across the region, mainly in rural areas.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” said U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

The Trump Administration cut funding from the following Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub partner projects located in Washington state:

Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102,797,603

Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157,342,270

Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce Counties): $11,800,670

Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36,385,400

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a collective of projects aimed at green hydrogen ecosystem spurring billions of dollars of infrastructure investment to provide alternatives to fossil fuels, has been years development and won a highly competitive national competition to receive the roughly $1 billion federal funding award. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) choose the Pacific Northwest Hub to demonstrate how clean hydrogen generated from hydropower could be utilized by a range of industries and transportation sectors.

In October 2023, the DOE designated PNWH2 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation, focused on harnessing the Pacific Northwest’s abundant and clean hydropower supplies to produce hydrogen through hydrolysis.

In July 2024, DOE announced that PNWH2 received Phase 1 award status and would receive an initial amount of up to $27.5 million to fund initial planning, permitting, and analysis activities to ensure that the overall Hub concept is technologically and financially viable, with input from relevant local stakeholders. Besides the $1 billion in federal cost-sharing, the Hub expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local investments.

Sen. Cantwell worked to include the H2Hubs program and other key hydrogen investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) during consideration in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where she served as a senior member, in July 2021, and push for its successful passage through the Senate. Together with the clean hydrogen incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), these investments represent a historical investment that will help spur hydrogen to be an important piece of the decarbonizing puzzle needed to reach our climate goals.

In March 2024, Sen. Cantwell co-led a bipartisan delegation of Washington and Oregon lawmakers voicing their support for PNWH2 in a letter to the DOE.

“Supported by the region’s vast federal and non-federal hydropower resources, the PNWH2 will not only demonstrate our region’s ability to produce, process, deliver, store, and use clean hydrogen, we believe it will serve as a national model of how an integrated clean hydrogen network can facilitate the creation of an affordable and self-sustaining clean hydrogen economy,” the lawmakers wrote.

In July 2024, Sen. Cantwell led her colleagues in a letter to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the agency to ease its criteria for hydrogen power development projects that qualify for the Section 45V Credit, which was established by the IRA and reimburses hydrogen power projects by up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced.

“The 45V credit offers the United States an irreplaceable opportunity to boost our economic and international competitiveness. At this critical juncture for the expansion of domestic clean hydrogen production, it is important that Treasury apply a workable tax treatment of new projects to spur investment, attract customers, and promote new clean energy jobs,” the senators wrote. The letter also stated, “Getting it right means capitalizing on this opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster and enhance our energy security, while strengthening our economy, creating thousands of jobs, and combating the climate crisis.”

The H2Hubs program was established by the BIL. It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States. These networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure will help accelerate the use of hydrogen as clean energy and work toward achieving the goal of a 100 percent clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/themes/cantwell/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 22:59:20.233939

They discount coal, and they inflate the cost for clean energy—wind and solar and transmission.
We would welcome any partnerships with the utility to invest in clean energy options to help keep rates low.
We need to retire these aging coal plants and invest in more affordable, clean energy options for Arkansans to help keep our rates lower.","Coal-powered electricity has long had an impact on American energy systems and our environment. In its latest Dirty Truth report, the Sierra Club pulls back the curtain on the industry, grading U.S. utilities on their climate pledges and calling out greenwashing, as well as flagging slow coal plant retirements and challenging cities and states to demand more accountability.

Ozarks at Large’s Jack Travis reached out to two people deeply immersed in those questions: Emory Hopkins, Sierra Club organizer for Arkansas, and Peter Nierengarten, director of sustainability for the city of Fayetteville. They dig into what the Dirty Truth reveals about Arkansas utilities, what's realistic for cities, and how citizens can push for change.

As far as utilities in the Natural State, Hopkins says they're in a steady decline and possibly overcharging their customers.

Hopkins: SWEPCO we can see is backsliding, and this has been their worst score in the history of the Dirty Truth report. They scored an F. They're investing way too much money in their aging, dirty, polluting Flint Creek Coal Plant, which is located in northwest Arkansas. SWEPCO actually, right now, is asking the Arkansas Public Service Commission for a rate hike, and they want to spend over $30 million to invest in the Flint Creek plant in their current rate case.

They're also planning to build more expensive gas plants, more than 3 gigawatts by 2035, which is a lot of energy, while also investing less in clean, affordable energy than they have in previous years.

The Arkansas Electric Cooperative also scored an F. This is also their worst score in the history of the Dirty Truth report. AECC owns the Flint Creek coal plant with SWEPCO, and this aging, polluting plant has no retirement commitment. They also had one of the lowest renewable scores in the entire United States, earning 0 percent because they had no planned solar or wind while facing future load growth.

And finally, Entergy Arkansas earned a C. The reason why they earned a C rather than a D or an F is largely due to their commitments to retire the costly White Bluff and Independence coal plants, which will remove hundreds of tons of toxic chemicals from the air every year. But the reason why they didn't score higher is because Entergy Arkansas needs to be planning for more renewables moving forward.

Travis: More on Entergy. They're backtracking their 2030 clean energy goals. Could you talk about what message that sends to customers and policymakers?

Hopkins: This is a trend that we're seeing throughout the country. We've seen some of the lowest scores in the Dirty Truth since it was first published. Really, what we're seeing here is that utilities need to be making better choices and plan better for a future with more demand, which includes having a better diversity of resources and access to cleaner, affordable energy rather than relying only on fossil fuels.

We also need to be seeing our utilities investing more in technology like transmission because we need to have access to cleaner energy and more affordable energy in other places, like Oklahoma, which has great access to wind, for example. If Arkansas had access to that energy, it would make everybody's bills more affordable.

Travis: The report warns that some of that poor planning could increase household electricity bills by $120 by the year 2030 and $230 by 2035. Is that already playing out in Arkansas? Are we seeing rate increases?

Hopkins: We're absolutely seeing rate increases. For example, as we were talking about, SWEPCO right now has a docket open with the Public Service Commission where they are asking to increase rates by an average of 27 percent for residential customers. I think that number is a wider range for commercial customers—it's 20 to 40 percent. That's already $30 on normal residential customers’ bills, and we expect to see this trend continue moving forward.

Travis: How would a data center going up in West Memphis affect these results?

Hopkins: We see that throughout the country. Data centers are causing a lot of load growth, and utilities have not done the proper planning to keep up with something like that. A lot of utilities are backsliding on their clean energy commitments. My hope is that we can hold our utilities accountable to keeping their clean energy goals and keeping our bills affordable while big companies invest more in things like data centers.

Travis: How does continued reliance on these coal and new gas plants affect public health in Arkansas, especially for vulnerable lower-income communities?

Hopkins: We often see coal plants, gas plants already in the most marginalized communities, which are communities who are already paying so much of their income toward their electric bill. I don't have all of the stats on hand, but I do know that in 2023 alone, Flint Creek, for example, cost the residents of Arkansas over $13 million in health impacts such as ER visits and asthma attacks, cardiac and neurological diseases, as well as missed days of school and work. And that's just one of the coal plants that resides in Arkansas.

Nierengarten: And I'd just add, Jack, that from a pollution perspective, I think we've known for a long time that coal plants in particular emit dirty pollutants. Those are bad for our health. They're also bad for our environment. But what we're seeing play out today with the SWEPCO rate increase that Emory referenced is they're also bad for our pocketbooks. Continuing to operate these aging, dirty, particularly coal facilities is expensive.

The coal train coming to Arkansas from Wyoming, delivering that coal every single day, is expensive—to mine it out of the ground in Wyoming and ship it all the way to Arkansas and burn it in that coal plant. That has a cost that's much higher than wind and solar and other clean energy options and transmission. And so the economic argument for clean energy is really playing out and really laid bare by this 27 percent rate increase that SWEPCO has proposed.

Travis: With regard to that, if y'all could have the ear of a policymaker or a regulatory commission, what recommendations would either of y'all have if you could have just 15 minutes to really speak your mind?

Nierengarten: The city of Fayetteville has intervened in this rate case that SWEPCO has opened right now, and we've submitted our testimony to the Public Service Commission. Essentially, our arguments are that the economic justification that SWEPCO has used to continue and further the operation of the coal plant is unsound and uses bad math. They discount coal, and they inflate the cost for clean energy—wind and solar and transmission. If you corrected for both of those items, closing the coal plant would be in the best economic interest of Arkansas ratepayers.

Our message to the Arkansas Public Service Commission is disallow the $31 million that SWEPCO is asking for rate recovery on associated with these improvements at the coal plant because it's a bad economic investment for Arkansans, and it's causing our utility bills to go up.

Travis: How much influence or sway does the city of Fayetteville have with the Arkansas Public Service Commission?

Nierengarten: It's a difficult question to answer. We're one of about 10 intervening parties, along with Walmart, the University of Arkansas, the Sierra Club, Audubon, the attorney general's office, and a couple others. We have standing. They've accepted our testimony, and we hope that they are listening. I think our arguments are strong and sound.

If you look at the economic impact of the rate increase, it's over $30 per month for the average Arkansan. If you do the math on what that impact looks like just across Fayetteville alone, it's over $15 million a year in added electricity costs. That's going to be leaving our local economy, in part to support this aging coal plant that again is importing coal from Wyoming to burn and generate dirty electricity for Arkansas.

Travis: Does the city have any tools that can help people reduce their energy burden even when utilities are slow to transition? I know that Fayetteville is kind of a leader in sustainable energy.

Nierengarten: Yeah. We've been investing heavily in clean energy. We've got 10 megawatts of ground-mounted solar at our two wastewater treatment plants. That's helped levelize our electricity costs that we pass on to our ratepayers. That's part of what we're investing in to try to keep our services as low as possible in the city of Fayetteville, as our strategy to help mitigate the impacts of the rate increase.

Travis: Do you see any opportunities for partnerships between cities like Fayetteville and utilities that could accelerate some of that clean energy adoption?

Nierengarten: Yeah, we would certainly welcome any partnerships. That could be especially beneficial beyond us as a large ratepayer, but also for the average ratepayer, the residents and the businesses across the city. We would welcome any partnerships with the utility to invest in clean energy options to help keep rates low.

Travis: What's one action that you would like to see Arkansans—just normal residents—push for, whether through policy, city programs or grassroots advocacy, in response to this Dirty Truth report?

Hopkins: Jack, I love that question. Peter talked about the different people and entities that are intervening in this rate case. But normal Arkansans also have an opportunity to leave public comment and give testimony. I would really encourage everybody listening to go tell the Arkansas Public Service Commission that you don't want your utilities to pass on the costs of dirty coal onto everyday ratepayers and increase rates.

They can do that through—I'm going to shamelessly plug—sc.org/noratehike We have a site to make it easy for people to submit their public comment. There's also going to be an opportunity for public testimony in person in Texarkana on Dec. 2 and Fayetteville Dec. 4.

Nierengarten: We absolutely support folks making their comments heard directly to the Arkansas Public Service Commission. Use the link the Sierra Club has available, show up in person in December at the public hearing. That's your opportunity to talk directly to the Arkansas Public Service Commission and help them understand that we don't want to see continued investment in aging, dirty coal infrastructure that's causing our electricity rates to rise.

The only thing I would add, Jack, is we've known for a long time that coal plants produce dirty pollution. It's bad for our health. It's bad for our environment. And it's also bad for our pocketbooks. I think the current SWEPCO rate increase, the $31 million they want to pass on to ratepayers, that's going to cost the average Arkansan over $30 a month more in electricity rates. That lays bare the fact that the economics of coal is not good. We need to retire these aging coal plants and invest in more affordable, clean energy options for Arkansans to help keep our rates lower.

That was Peter Nierengarten from the city of Fayetteville and Sierra Club's Emory Hopkins speaking with Ozarks at Large’s Jack Travis about the Dirty Truth report.

Jack sought comments from the three Arkansas companies named in the report—SWEPCO, AECC and Entergy—for their input. Only AEC responded in time for our reporting here on Ozarks at Large. AECC manager of corporate communications, Marine Glisovic, stated via email that while the company considers all forms of generation, neither wind nor solar generation resources are capable of providing reliable energy at an affordable cost to serve as replacement generation for its 1.2 million members.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ef4293/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+13/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Fa7%2F827916424ab5a0022dd7be4abe22%2Fnew-grove-2025-10-02t162511-860.png,N,,2025-10-02 21:59:51.761704

​“Energy does not abide by state boundaries.
Other groundbreaking interregional transmission projects are also facing the ax.
Similar grants awarded to utilities in states that voted for Trump have not been singled out for cancellation.
That includes grid-hardening grants for Gulf Coast utility Entergy ($53.8 million), Michigan utility Consumers Energy ($100 million), and Pennsylvania’s PECO Energy ($100 million).","The Trump administration has declared it will claw back billions of dollars in federal funding that utilities and other recipients are using to strengthen power grids and reduce electricity prices — almost entirely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In a Wednesday post on X, Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, declared the administration would cancel ​“nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.” He listed 16 states that would lose project funding — every single one of which voted for Harris last year.

Democrats reacted with fury, saying the Trump administration is abusing its power in an attempt to force Democrats to concede to Republican demands in a congressional budget dispute that has led to the current federal government shutdown.

On Thursday morning, the Department of Energy announced the ​“termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects,” which it claimed would save American taxpayers $7.56 billion. The DOE has not disclosed which grants or projects it has targeted for termination. The agency did not respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

“Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states was nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, the New Mexico Democrat who serves as ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in a statement. ​“These are projects that Congress already approved and funded — projects that create jobs, lower electricity costs, and move our country forward.”

Two separate sources have provided Canary Media with a list of the 321 grants being targeted by the DOE. The vast majority are indeed in blue states.

The DOE stated that the terminated projects ​“did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” But the partisan breakdown of cancellations appears to belie that statement.

The list includes 26 grants issued by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (GDO) under a program created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to expand the country’s struggling transmission network, harden the grid against extreme weather, build microgrids to protect vulnerable communities during power outages, and deploy technologies to integrate solar, wind, EVs, and batteries into the grid.

The 26 GDO grants slated for cancellation are exclusively in the states that Vought singled out in his Wednesday X post: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

Meanwhile, the DOE’s termination list does not include dozens more GDO grants issued in 2023, August 2024, and October 2024 for utility projects in states that voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Many of those projects are strikingly similar to the ones marked for cancellation in blue states.

“This will result in lost jobs, stranded investments, increasing energy prices — all the things the administration says out of the other side of their mouth that they’re working against,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.

“Even on their own terms — ​‘We’re going to damage those Democrats in the blue states!’ — they’re full of shit,” he added. ​“Energy does not abide by state boundaries. Electrons flow, supply chains flow, markets are often regional or national in nature. Anytime you destroy a project in one part of the country, it’s going to affect another part of the country.”

Some of the GDO grants set for termination are helping to finance core transmission grid infrastructure projects that will span red and blue states alike.

For example, in 2023 the Minnesota Department of Commerce, which is named on the DOE’s list, was awarded a $464 million grant to be backed by $1.3 billion from members of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, two grid operators spanning nearly a dozen Midwestern states. Those combined funds were meant to help finance a set of new transmission lines that will connect the grids between the two regions.

Lack of transmission capacity has driven up power prices across the Midwest and stymied development of lower-cost wind and solar projects that could reduce utility bills. The DOE previously estimated that the transmission built through this initiative could enable an additional 35 gigawatts of clean energy to be brought onto the grid by 2030.

Other groundbreaking interregional transmission projects are also facing the ax. Allete, a Minnesota-based utility on the DOE’s termination list, is a co-recipient of a $700 million grant meant to spur development of the North Plains Connector project, a high-voltage direct-current interconnection across Montana and North Dakota. The partners in the consortium, which include the Montana Department of Commerce, the Colstrip Transmission System, and grid developer Grid United, plan to invest $2.9 billion in matching funds.

Other grants targeted for termination are more state-specific. For example, in Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs and utility Portland General Electric were awarded $250 million to upgrade transmission grid capacity to connect clean energy projects in the eastern part of the state with the state’s urban centers west of the Cascade Mountains.

The California Energy Commission, also on the list, last year received a $600 million federal grant to upgrade 100 miles of electric transmission lines with high-tech power cables that are lighter, stronger, and able to carry more electricity than traditional ones.

Several grants intended to improve grid resilience by adding more clean energy are also slated for cancellation. Maryland utility Baltimore Gas & Electric, Illinois utility Commonwealth Edison, California utility Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and National Grid in New York and Massachusetts were awarded $50 million apiece to help integrate rooftop solar, backup batteries, and other distributed energy resources into their grids.

The list also targets investments in microgrids — combinations of on-site generation, solar, batteries, and power-control systems that serve critical facilities like hospitals and emergency centers. California’s Redwood Coast Energy Authority was awarded $88 million for a project that will finance the development of microgrids on the lands of Northern California’s Hoopa Valley, Yurok, Karuk, and Blue Lake Rancheria tribes. New Mexico’s Kit Carson Electric Cooperative won a $15.4 million grant to build a battery resiliency project. And the Jamestown Board of Public Utilities in New York received a $17 million grant for a community microgrid project.

The DOE had previously determined that these co-investments from the federal government were important for bolstering grid reliability in the face of increasingly extreme weather.

Similar grants awarded to utilities in states that voted for Trump have not been singled out for cancellation. That includes grid-hardening grants for Gulf Coast utility Entergy ($53.8 million), Michigan utility Consumers Energy ($100 million), and Pennsylvania’s PECO Energy ($100 million). Also spared were grants for resiliency projects such as $249 million to deploy microgrids across Louisiana, and grid-enhancing technology deployments such as a $160 million grant for utility Georgia Power to deploy advanced power cables and ​“dynamic line rating” technologies to expand the capacity of its transmission network.

It’s unclear how and when the threatened cuts will take effect, Walsh said. The ongoing government shutdown has scrambled communications with the DOE officials in charge of managing the grants set for termination. Grantees have the right to challenge the terminations with the DOE and in court.

“I hope a lot of them avail themselves of that,” he said. ​“The Trump administration is doing this stuff even when they don’t necessarily believe they can win in the courts. Part of the strategy is to make this so difficult that project developers or investors just walk away because the administration has elevated the risk to an unacceptable level.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2223415726-copy.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a441855e6356a8a8c741f9f5f25397aa,N,,2025-10-02 22:59:37.332821

DEEP Will Hold Webinar on DCRF and This Next Round of Funding October 3.

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) is pleased to announce a call for applications and a draft Request for Proposals under an expanded DEEP Climate Resilience Fund. DEEP is making available up to $33 million in state funds and up to $11.8 million in federal funds for projects that protect communities and critical infrastructure from extreme weather. This opportunity is open to municipalities, non-profit organizations, and other entities, and includes new funding categories that will support a wide range of community and energy resilience projects.

In recent years, Connecticut has experienced widespread impacts from extreme weather, including historic flooding in the Naugatuck Valley, unprecedented wildfires, and the hottest summer weather on record. These climate-driven hazards have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to homes, roads, bridges, and businesses. Connecticut’s communities have endured these recent challenges from extreme weather just as federal support for resilience is becoming less certain.

DEEP is releasing the next round of the Climate Resilience Fund to assist communities navigating these changes to the federal funding landscape and continue developing projects that make Connecticut more resilient. Leveraging the expertise of staff across DEEP’s environmental as well as energy programs, DEEP’s “one-stop shop” is ready to assist communities as they pursue resilience planning and project implementation and assess what federal support might be available to them to maximize their dollars.

“The 2025 DEEP Climate Resilience Fund builds on DEEP’s strong track record of investing in community resilience, from microgrids to flood mitigation projects, with a comprehensive approach that includes energy resilience and nature-based solutions,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “With climate change accelerating and traditional federal financial support uncertain, it’s more important than ever to help municipalities access every possible option for matching funds for resilience projects. The DCRF’s ‘single-front’ door approach is intended to do just that, making it easier for municipalities to seek project deployment funds for projects that will protect communities from floods, heat waves, power outages, and other extreme weather events.”

The DCRF Notice of Funding Opportunity and draft Request for Proposals include funding categories intended to help build a pipeline of successful resilience projects statewide. DCRF will support resilience planning to help communities identify risks and potential solutions, and project advancement to fund the design work needed to transform plans into projects. DCRF also includes a new category for project deployment that will provide direct and matching funds for construction of community and energy resilience projects, expanding upon DEEP’s prior Microgrid Grant and Loan Program. Through this new deployment funding category, DEEP anticipates providing support for measures as diverse as flood control projects, climate-smart improvements to energy infrastructure and other community lifelines, wildfire prevention strategies, nature-based solutions for cooling urban centers, energy resilience measures, and other innovative resilience projects.

“We are pleased to continue our partnership with DEEP to help communities reduce the risk of disasters and rebuild with resilience,” DEMHS Deputy Commissioner Brenda Bergeron said. “We look forward to encouraging communities who need matching funds for federal grants to apply to DEEP’s new matching funds program, which will help communities better navigate the current uncertainty in the federal funding landscape and successfully compete for funding.”

Previous DCRF-funded projects:

In 2023, DEEP awarded $8.8 million in planning and advancement grants through the inaugural round of the DEEP Climate Resilience Fund. These awards supported 21 innovative climate resilience plans and projects across 17 Connecticut municipalities and Councils of Government, including:

$250,000 to the City of Bridgeport to conduct a comprehensive climate risk and vulnerability assessment, and develop a prioritized list of strategies, actions, and projects.

$689,181 to the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments to develop and advance culvert replacement and drainage system improvement projects in nine municipalities to reduce stormwater flooding.

$506,000 to the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority to conduct studies on street flooding and sewer back-ups in the Westville neighborhood, and identify and evaluate options for potential projects that include nature-based solutions.

$250,000 to the Capitol Region Council of Governments to work with municipalities in the CRCOG region to conduct stormwater authority feasibility assessments.

Previous Microgrid Grant and Loan Program projects:

Since 2013, DEEP has awarded more than $22 million to 10 operational microgrids across the state. These projects support critical facilities like police stations, fire stations, municipal buildings, and hospitals during power outages. The new, comprehensive DCRF program will be open to microgrids as well as other energy resilience projects.

This current round of the DEEP Climate Resilience Fund is open to municipal governments, local public utilities, non-profit organizations, state and federally recognized Tribal nations, and other entities. Additional details on eligibility, funding categories, program priorities, and how to apply can be found in the Notice of Funding Opportunity and draft Request for Proposals.

DEEP will be holding a webinar to provide an overview of this funding opportunity on October 3, 2025, at 10 a.m. as part of Governor Lamont’s Sustainability and Resilience Week. Go here to register for the webinar: Webinar Registration - Zoom

Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The Energy Department said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Wright told CNN Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made — business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.

While the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the Energy Department’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

Federal Judge Mustafa Kasubhai of the U.S. District Court in Oregon sided this week with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other Democratic attorneys general who sued the U.S. Department of Energy and its leader, Chris Wright, in August over attempts to cut funding for such projects. Kasubhai found the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, violating reimbursement regulations established by the federal energy department.

Kasubhai gave his ruling from the bench and no written order has yet been filed with the court.

States argued that a new federal energy department rule mandating that “indirect” and “fringe” costs for State Energy Program projects — such as staff salaries, health insurance and pensions — cannot exceed 10% of overall project costs was arbitrary, against the law and would lead to needless job losses and project terminations. Officials from the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

The federal grants help state energy agencies pay for the design, development and execution of renewable energy projects and energy efficiency programs. The grants fund electric vehicles for state and local governments and public transit, state-sponsored home weatherization programs, energy affordability programs for low-income residents, emergency preparedness and state energy planning.

Last year, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal grants through the program, according to Rayfield’s office. Most of the money paid for on-the-ground project costs, but nearly half — about $333,000 — went to indirect and fringe costs, such as project staff salaries, as well as health and retirement benefits.

“The court’s decision means Oregon can keep these energy programs running the way they were meant to,” Rayfield spokesperson Jenny Hansson said in an email. “This is about making sure we have the resources to do the job and prevent the Trump administration from increasing energy prices on Oregonians.”

Other federal agencies have recently attempted to impose similar overhead caps on federally funded projects at colleges that receive grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. All have been blocked in court.

Rayfield was joined in the latest suit by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov.

The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money ""to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled.""

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican's short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — ""favorite projects, and they'd be permanently cut.""

""I'm allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,"" Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden's agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

The Energy Department did not respond to CNBC's request for that list.
Kathy Hochul, said that the funding cuts ""come as no surprise given the Trump administration's full-on assault on clean energy.""","The Energy Department's cancellation of more than 300 funding awards to projects in 16 states won by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election slammed the brakes on efforts to reduce carbon emissions, air and water pollution, and strengthen electrical grids.

The elimination of nearly $8 billion in funding for more than 200 projects could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs that would have been created by the projects, and undercut the Trump administration's own stated goals of boosting American manufacturing competitiveness, critics said.

The cuts were announced on Wednesday, the first day of the federal government shutdown. Earlier Wednesday, the Trump administration froze a whopping $18 billion in funding for two massive infrastructure projects in New York City — the home of Congress's two top Democrats.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday, referring to the Energy Department's funding cancellations, said, ""Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans' costs and create jobs.""

""This goes beyond targeting blue states. It's taking a wrecking ball to working families' lives: putting construction workers out of a job and raising families' electric bills for political gain,"" Schumer said.

While some of the department's cancellations first announced by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought were new, others had been previously announced in May by the department.

Vought likewise trumpeted the funding freeze for a project to build a new rail tunnel connecting New Jersey to New York under the Hudson River, and to extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, before the Department of Transportation formally announced the move.

""That hub will create a clean hydrogen economy across our region,"" Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement to CNBC.

""It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,"" Ferguson said. ""We're working with the Attorney General's Office to fight this illegal action.""

Chris Green, president of the Pacific Hydrogen Association, called the cancellation of federal funds for the hub ""a gut punch.""

""We are, of course, very disappointed in that,"" Green told CNBC, noting that the project could have led to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of jobs.

He said that companies involved in the hub ""were spending lots of their own money,"" with about 80% of the committed funds being provided by private companies, with federal funds providing the remaining 20% or so of the costs.

""Can we still do this project now that we've lost 20% of our planned revenue?"" Green asked. ""It remains to be seen if some of these projects can persevere.""

The Colorado Energy Office said that more than 30 grants totalling more than $500 million ""are being illegally terminated in Colorado alone.

Two of those grants each provide $2.5 million to support reduced energy use and create cost savings through building energy codes and building performance standards through decarbonization, the office said.

""Other terminated grants in Colorado range from oil and gas methane reduction projects and investments in grid resilience to support for utility programs in low-income communities,"" the office said.

""This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community,"" the office said.

In New Mexico, 10 projects had more than $135 million of Energy Department funding cancelled.

Four of them were under the auspices of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, including one with $42.7 million from the Energy Department to ""develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin to verify these sites can securely store 50 million tons of CO2,"" according to the office of Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.

Heinrich, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday, ""Minutes before the news of these cancelled projects broke, I had just left lunch with [Energy] Secretary [Chris] Wright and he had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state — projects that affect real jobs and real families.""

""That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions,"" Heinrich said in a statement.

""The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives,"" he said. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.""

The Energy Department, in a statement, said that the cancellations followed "" a thorough, individualized financial review,"" which ""determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Energy Secretary Wright said that many of the awards were ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,"" Write said, adding that the cancellations ""deliver on that commitment.""

The department said that of the 321 financial awards terminated, ""26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day,"" with those awards alone valued at more than $3.1 billion.

But Wells, the NRDC advocate, said that despite the Energy Department's claims, ""there's been a confusing lack of transparency in this process of cancelling"" funding.

Wells contrasted that to the Biden administration's vetting of the projects before they were approved. He noted that the department itself had not publicly released a list of the cancelled projects.

The Energy Department did not respond to CNBC's request for that list.

Wells pointed out that several Democratic members of Congress, including New Mexico's Heinrich, in early September had raised concerns about the influence of political appointees in the Energy Department to cancel funding of projects in May.

""This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent,"" Heinrich and two other Democrats, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, and New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., wrote in a letter to Wright. ""It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.""

""These programs are not optional,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them.""

Ken Lovett, the senior communications advisor on energy and environment for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, said that the funding cuts ""come as no surprise given the Trump administration's full-on assault on clean energy.""

""Whether it's blocking offshore wind, cutting federal incentives for electric vehicles and solar energy, or rolling back clean air and clean water standards, the Trump administration's attempt to rollback the progress we have made puts New Yorkers' well-being and safety at risk,"" Lovett said in a statement.

""We will not go back.""

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

A Maryland utility is touting a project that allows owners of Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickups to send power from their vehicles to the grid and get compensated for it.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. project is a partnership with Ford, the automaker, and Sunrun, a solar and energy services company. It’s the kind of thing that, if deployed on a large scale, could be transformative for the grid.

But the nagging sense I get when reading about vehicle-to-grid pilot projects is that this is an opportunity that remains largely untapped. The Maryland project, for example, involves just three trucks.

Electric vehicles use the large majority of the lithium-ion batteries being produced in today’s market. When those EV batteries are sitting in garages and connected to chargers, they become a potentially vast resource that can be utilized by the grid, generating income for the vehicles’ owners. But to realize this opportunity, utilities, automakers and regulators need to move beyond pilot projects.

Also, the market share for EVs needs to continue to grow, and the Trump administration’s cancellation of the tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying a new EV is a setback. The tax credit ended this week, and analysts expect it will lead to a decrease in EV sales at least in the short term.

I spoke with Willett Kempton, a University of Delaware professor who first wrote about the potential of vehicle-to-grid power in 1997. That paper, co-authored with Steven E. Letendre, who was then at Green Mountain College in Vermont, had a central idea that seemed almost like science fiction at the time, when EVs barely existed. The paper’s title sums it up: “Electric vehicles as a new power source for electric utilities.”

One of its key points was that the technology for using EVs to power the grid was pretty simple. Consumers would need to have bi-directional chargers, capable of sending electricity from the grid to the battery, and from the battery to the grid. And grid managers would need software to control the flow of electricity to the grid.

Kempton found that groups of EVs could send power to the grid and receive compensation that would help to offset the costs of owning the vehicle. There would be almost no negative effect on battery life or the vehicle’s readiness for use.

“The economics are really compelling,” he said.

Here’s some of the math he found exciting: If the United States could get to the point that one-fourth of its vehicles were EVs with bi-directional chargers, they would provide the grid with access to 660 gigawatts of capacity. That figure, from a 2005 paper he co-authored, was close to the total capacity of all U.S. power plants at that time. Since then, other researchers have conducted their own versions of this calculation using more recent variables, underscoring the vast potential.

The main stumbling block turned out to be the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards so that they would all be speaking the equivalent of the same language regarding how the system controls would work.

Only recently, decades after that 1997 paper, are companies involved in vehicle-to-grid technology beginning to adopt common charging standards. Now that the standards are coming into place, automakers and utilities have a much easier time setting up vehicle-to-grid programs than they would have before.

Progress is now happening with the development of laws and rules in the states and with pilot projects by companies such as Nuvve of San Diego, a leading player in vehicle-to-grid technology.

Nuvve’s U.S. projects include managing power from a fleet of electric buses in the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area.

At least eight states have recently enacted or introduced legislation or regulatory actions to foster vehicle-to-grid technology, according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center. They are: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Delaware has been at the forefront, including the work of Kempton and his colleagues at the University of Delaware. Researchers there, sometimes in partnership with the utility Delmarva Power, have used vehicles from Nissan, BMW and other makers as part of various pilot projects.

One recurring theme across the states is that electric buses and fleet vehicles are a common early step for vehicle-to-grid technology because the batteries are large and they are often parked in a central location, making them easier to manage.

What I don’t see anywhere are projects with hundreds or thousands of residential EVs. In this way, vehicle-to-grid initiatives are not as far along as some of the efforts involving home battery systems used in virtual power plants, which are groups of batteries that work together to function like a power plant. Sunrun is a key player in virtual power plants and it has several vehicle-to-grid projects, including the one in Maryland.

Sunrun describes the Maryland initiative as the first in the country to use residential vehicles, as opposed to commercial or fleet vehicles. Last week, it announced that the vehicles had successfully sent power to the grid, after about a year of setting up systems to allow this to happen.

“In addition to showing how electric vehicles can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers,” said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell in a statement.

Beginning in July, the utility had the ability to use power from the trucks during the peak demand hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays. The vehicles’ owners get paid based on the amount of electricity they share, which caps at $1,000 for a period that ran from July to September, Sunrun said.

Sunrun has been working with Ford to develop programs such as the one in Baltimore. The long-term goal is to make it commonplace for an EV owner to be able to use their vehicle’s battery for backup power at home or as an income source by selling power to the grid.

Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe. BMW announced a program last month in Germany where consumers could receive essentially free charging at home in exchange for allowing their battery to provide power to the grid when it’s connected to a charger.

In 1997, Kempton expected that this technology would be much further along than it is today.

“I thought the world was going to beat a path,” he said.

But he is optimistic that today’s pilot projects indicate a market on the cusp of something big. He notes that most of the new EVs coming onto the market have built-in capability for bi-directional charging, and many utilities are in some phase of integrating this into their grid management.

So, let’s see a utility do a vehicle-to-grid project with hundreds or even thousands of vehicles. And let’s see it soon.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/car-8301630_1920.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:01:54.085968

As India sits on the cusp of launching its own carbon markets via the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) for the first time, the industry looks keenly to the list of activities that would be eligible to produce carbon credits.

In a cap-and-trade system such as the one India is constructing its carbon market upon, ideally activities undertaken by the obligated entities to reduce their footprints should be generating carbon credits.

But after a public outcry and expert inputs, it has since also been decided to include a ""voluntary"" offset market in the CCTS, which would ease the burden on the obligated entities to directly reduce their emissions. This move makes logical sense, as the industries currently mandated to reduce their carbon footprint under the CCTS are ones like cement, oil and gas, and aluminium, which can only reduce their emissions directly to a certain point.

While it may not be an obvious problem in the first few cycles, without having an alternative offset market in the long term sets the CCTS to fail to meet its objectives. Either due to the targets being scientifically impossible to meet or the deliberate reduction in the quantum of reductions required so as to continue the scheme.

Necessity of offsets

Therefore, offset markets are necessary for the health and sustainability of the compliance part of the Indian Carbon Market. While currently these offsets are left to be voluntary in nature, if one is to learn from the models developed by countries like Singapore and South Korea, there would eventually be a mandated component of 5-10% required to be purchased through the offset markets.

However, in all of this jargon and thick layers of policy, one very important opportunity remains missing — which is Indian biofuels, especially the first-generation (1G) ethanol — something that India is producing in abundance but not really cashing upon its whole gamut of benefits vis-à-vis its environmental impact.

Challenges

The BM 001 methodology that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency government agency has released for public review as part of the ""offset"" scheme does mention biofuel. But as it is a replica of the Clean Development Mechanism methodology on the subject, it presently requires dedicated plantations set up for biofuel production for it to be eligible to produce carbon credits —something that is practically impossible to do in India.

When viewed juxtaposed to the Essential Commodities Act, especially in the case of maize and sugarcane, it might even border on being illegal.

While this initial concern may be addressed in forthcoming drafts of these methodologies, other constraints present in it — while allowing next-generation biofuels like second-generation (2G) ethanol — still render carbon credits for 1G ethanol practically impossible.

Missed opportunity

This should be viewed by our policymakers as a missed opportunity for the country, as we have outperformed our own expectations by achieving 20% blending five years before schedule and are most likely to go ahead on increasing the base blend or allowing for flex-fuel blending with 100% ethanol dispensation, as is already available on 400-odd Indian pumps.

While so far the development of the ethanol programme has been driven by its ability to replace foreign imports, increase energy security, and augment farmer incomes, the environmental impact of this gargantuan measure is mostly qualitatively assessed and not truly capitalised upon.

This becomes more relevant when we consider how going above a 20% blend without any price differentiation between gasoline and ethanol would be a big blow to consumers, with data suggesting an almost 30% loss in efficiency (mileage) when extended up to 100% ethanol blend.

Given that the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) already face stiff price competition from gasoline prices for ethanol, it is still more difficult for the supply side to create this price parity without some additional scheme or support being provided.

Win-Win-Win

Carbon credits come as a natural 'win-win-win' solution for all of these issues. It has already been quantified under various research and policy papers that 1.2-1.5 tonnes of CO2 is saved by mixing every one kilolitre of ethanol with gasoline due to the same amount of fossil fuel use avoided.

Extrapolating this, India has saved more than 50 million tonnes of CO2 emissions so far and would soon cross even 100 million tonnes in the next two years.

A robust carbon accounting and crediting mechanism would drastically feed into India's Nationally Determined Contribution goals and affect it up to as much as 5-7% — an opportunity we have so far missed.

Now the question remains: how would such a scheme work within the existing framework of Indian the CCTS? And the easy answer is: it will not.

When we look at global precedents where carbon-based credits are given for 1G ethanol production, like in Brazil and the US, it is a dedicated scheme addressing this singular issue.

Learning from global precedents

While the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 in the US gives tax credits based on carbon reductions, Brazil's RenovaBio policy mandates the OMCs to buy these credits from the ethanol producers, and these credits are traded in open markets with the ethanol producers competing to make their product as carbon negative as possible in order to fetch a higher value for their produce.

While this policy is now being extended to other biofuels like CBG and SAF, the very existence of this act makes Brazil aim for achieving a negative footprint for their ethanol, which presently remains at 22gm CO2/MJ.

An important point to note here is that Indian ethanol, due to differences in fertilizer use and the prominence of manual harvesting, is 30-40% less carbon intensive —and this difference really starts showing when we are not able to capitalize in our SAF production, where every gram of CO2 fetches a premium price from the fuel markets.

As a result of RenovaBio, Brazil's framework has also been easily integrated within Corsia's list of carbon intensity for SAF from various feedstocks in various countries, while an Indian number remains woefully missing — causing another missed opportunity for Indian farmers.

Recommendations

So, looking at global examples, India must also mandate the OMCs to claim these credits as carbon reductions instead of carbon neutrality by purchasing them from ethanol producers.

This would: create a transparent framework to achieve their own publicly declared net-zero targets, upon which several critical international investments are hinged; and promote low-carbon production of ethanol and climate-resilient farming in India, which would have cascading benefits of its own.

Now, how this fits into the CCTS is for the policymakers to decide. Either OMCs can get a special exemption from meeting their mandatory targets if they purchase these ethanol carbon credits, or these credits are allowed to be claimed for mandatory reductions in the entire cap-and-trade system as a special category.

Given that the volume of these credits will be in millions, the latter choice might negatively impact the prices of other credits in the cap-and-trade system, and therefore the former seems to be a better choice. Keeping OMCs exempt from CCTS and having a specialised ""BharatBio"" scheme for Indian biofuels is also another way to go.

Conclusion: Seizing the immense gains

What is sure is the many gains that India can have — not just for NDCs but for future internationally traded biofuels, like SAF — are immense, so there is enough incentive to make it work even if the answers are not easily visible.",https://www.qcintel.com/i/qci_logo_sq_300x300.png,N,,2025-10-02 20:01:40.613971

The federal spending cuts are part of a broader effort announced this week by the White House to scale back spending in Democratic states on clean energy projects and initiatives.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said, “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled … The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA.”

Washington state politicians decried the move as a politically motivated attack on states that did not vote for President Donald Trump.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage,” U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, said in a statement.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson connected the cuts to the partial government shutdown that began Wednesday.

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington. We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action,” wrote Ferguson in a social media post.

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Sammamish, said in a statement she would do “all I can to reverse this decision.”

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release that the canceled grants deliver on Trump’s promise to protect taxpayer dollars and expand the country’s supply of affordable and reliable energy.

According to DelBene’s office, the cuts include over 200 projects, totaling $7.56 billion nationwide, including $142 million in grants for 10 other projects than the hydrogen hubs in Washington.

Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said the state’s cuts add up to $308 million and would cost 10,000 jobs.

Advertising

The Department of Energy said that following a “thorough, individualized financial review,” these projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs” and do not “justify continued investment.”

In 2023, the Department of Energy said it would contribute $1 billion to establish a handful of green hydrogen production sites across Washington, Oregon and Montana. That money would be added to supplement around $5 billion to $6 billion in private funding and eventually be used in agriculture and heavy-duty industry and transportation.

Hydrogen is a colorless, flammable gas that does not emit carbon or other greenhouse gases when combusted. Currently, it is used for producing fertilizer and refining petroleum, though advocates of the technology say it could be used to replace natural gas to heat buildings or power long-haul trucks or ships through hydrogen fuel cells, among other uses.

The funding cuts had been long anticipated since Trump took office. In April, 16 Washington Republican lawmakers submitted a letter to Wright urging the continued funding for the Pacific Northwest hydrogen hub.

Other canceled grants in Washington were awarded to Nippon Dynawave Packaging, Paccar, CleanFiber, Washington State University, Spokane Edo LLC and Silfab Solar, according to DelBene’s office. The awards were issued by DOE’s office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.

President of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, Chris Green, said the termination of funding was a disappointing setback.

“It is a pretty big gut punch for all these companies that have been working so hard on this, including bringing their dollars in from all over the world to make these projects happen,” he said.

Green said the organization received the termination notice from the Department of Energy Wednesday evening.

Since the award was announced in 2023, Green said construction has not begun and the organization had been working through permits, design and engineering studies and negotiating contracts.

There is still “significant demand” for hydrogen in the Pacific Northwest and some companies have already indicated they still want to try to move forward, he said. However, it’s too early to know how all the projects will be impacted without the federal funding, Green said.

Planned project sites include Bellingham, Richland and Chehalis in Washington, Port of Morrow and Baker City in Oregon and St. Regis, Montana.

Hydrogen is used for refining petroleum, treating metals, producing fertilizer and processing foods, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nearly all of that hydrogen is called “grey,” meaning it is made with natural gas.

“Green” hydrogen is made by splitting water through an energy-intensive process called electrolysis. Advocates of the burgeoning technology say green hydrogen could clean up hard to decarbonize industries like aviation, maritime shipping and heavy duty manufacturing. However, skeptics of the technology have pointed to the massive amounts of electricity and money it would take to produce green hydrogen at scale.

The program’s grantees, including state governments, have an option to dispute the EPA’s move to repeal the Solar for All funds 30 days after receiving the termination letter.

Louisiana’s energy and natural resources department, which ended its program in early August, told the Washington Examiner via email: “The EPA gave notice that the federal program was being terminated, and our Office of Energy wound the state program down accordingly. The final work plan for carrying out the program had not yet been approved by the EPA, so there was not any significant project work to be impacted.”

Gov. Jeff Landry (R-LA) criticized the state’s “Solar for Y’all” initiative on social media, following the EPA’s effort to rescind its funding.

“The only thing that’s driven your electricity bills through the roof is the Democrat Party. Period. End of story,” Landry wrote on X in August.

“From Obama’s unconstitutional Clean Power Plan… to the fantasyland Green New Deal… to Biden’s $156 million Louisiana ‘Solar for All’ giveaway – every single one of these schemes bleeds taxpayers dry, drives up rates, and leaves our grid weaker than ever,” Landry said. He added that these types of policies and programs have driven up electricity costs.

Louisiana had previously been open to using the funds. In 2024, Tyler Gray, Landry’s secretary of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, said the state is “uniquely positioned to benefit” from the program, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.

Meanwhile, Democratic-led California has called the EPA’s move to terminate funding “unlawful” and said it is underway in implementing its Solar for All grants.

“Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate. Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects,” California’s Energy Commission said in August. It added that the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and Labor and Workforce Development Agency “urge the EPA to reverse its unlawful termination.”

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, repealed unobligated funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Utah’s Office of Energy Development cited the megatax bill as the reason for ending its own Solar for All program.

“The EPA ended the program in response to the repeal of Section 134 of the Clean Air Act by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” it said in a statement. “Although Utah remains committed to its any-of-the-above energy approach, the Utah Office of Energy Development is unable to move forward with its Solar for All program.”

Zealan Hoover, a former senior adviser at the EPA, previously told the Washington Examiner that the Solar for All program is designed to help nearly 1 million low- and middle-income families save on their electricity bills by installing solar panels and storage systems on rooftops or through nearby community solar facilities.

The program’s termination “takes four gigawatts of energy off the table at a moment when we have serious concerns about our ability to meet rising demand from [artificial intelligence] and other industries,” said Hoover, who also works as an independent adviser to the Environmental Protection Network.

“It is one of the last remaining pressure relief valves for families that are grappling with rapidly increasing electricity prices,” he added.

The latest Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that electricity prices increased by 6.2% for the year ending in August — more than twice the overall inflation rate of 2.9%.

CLIMATE GROUPS SEEK FULL COURT REHEARING OVER $20 BILLION GRANT CUTS

The EPA’s decision is part of a broader effort to dismantle programs funded by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The agency is currently engaged in a legal battle as it seeks to cancel funding for other initiatives under the program, including the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.

The EPA has claimed that under the Biden administration, funds were being disbursed rapidly with limited oversight before the Trump administration took office. The effort to rescind the Solar for All program will likely bring additional legal challenges against the EPA.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25260752779027.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-03 00:59:11.482520

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want, “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called the cancellation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects, from West Virginia to Washington state, selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart the development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, another environmental group, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

The Trump move doesn’t affect a popular state program known as Illinois Shines, which provides incentives and has no income eligibility requirements.","Gerald Jones used to pay hundreds of dollars a month for gas and electric service to his Chatham home.

With 23 solar panels installed on his South Side bungalow last year, he now pays as low as $75 a month.

That savings is also the result of better home insulation and a switch to electric heat, eliminating the need for natural gas that contributes to climate change.

But the solar panels, funded with the help of a state program called Solar for All, are the game changer, he said.

“I tell everybody: Get it,” said Jones, a retired mail carrier. “You can save money and the environment.”

State officials were counting on more than $130 million in federal funding to expand rooftop solar and related programs for low-income residents, a plan that would help more people like Jones.

But President Donald Trump pulled that funding.

The federal money was going to significantly expand the program, in place since 2019.

For now, a relatively small number of customers have taken part in the state program — just over 2,700. But state officials and program advocates hoped to change that trend at a time when electric bills are soaring for Illinois residents.

“This program was all about saving people money on their electricity bills, particularly people and communities that haven’t seen the benefits of solar, which is the cheapest way and quickest way to get electricity built,” said Adam Kent, an expert with the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council.

Kent’s organization did an analysis showing Trump withheld more than $9 billion in promised money across the country for various programs intended to fight climate change.

The money for Illinois was canceled illegally, according to Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration. Under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency said Congress recently gave it the power to end the promised money, setting up what’s likely to be a drawn-out dispute.

The termination of the funding “lacks any legal basis,” and “will cause irreparable harm to Illinoisans,” Pritzker’s administration wrote to the EPA last month.

Illinois electric utilities ComEd and Ameren offer tens of millions of dollars each year for solar subsidies, which are funded by charges on customers’ monthly power bills. The utilities will continue to provide money each year for rooftop solar assistance in Illinois, but state dollars may run out by the middle of next year.

The Trump move doesn’t affect a popular state program known as Illinois Shines, which provides incentives and has no income eligibility requirements. That program includes plans that allow people to earn credits on their utility bills by paying a monthly fee to support solar farms.

The expansion of rooftop panels through Solar for All helps all electric customers, according to ComEd.

The hottest days of summer stress the electric grid and drive up the price of electricity. So when people can produce their own power, it’s a savings for all customers, said Scott Vogt, ComEd’s vice president of strategy, energy policy and revenue initiatives.

In Illinois, Solar for All is intended to also help the state meet goals for clean energy and mitigate the impact of climate change.

It’s a pitch that appealed to Tekeyra Moore of Chicago Heights, who also participated in the program.

Moore said she worried about the health threats posed by natural gas. So she also cut off gas in addition to adding solar panels.

She said she definitely doesn’t miss gas bills that would rise above $200 a month during the winter. Her monthly bills are “now not even half” what they used to be, she said. “It’s a big savings.”

While Jones is pleased that he’s doing his part to help save the planet from climate change, he admits saving money while on a fixed income is an even bigger incentive.

“The main thing is saving me first,” he said.

Jones, who retired from the U.S. Postal Service 12 years ago, lives in the home his parents bought 70 years ago when it was newly built. He worked with Elevate Energy, the state’s program administrator, and ComEd to install the panels.

Asked about Trump’s move to cut the promised federal money, Jones shook his head.

“I think it’s terrible. I really think it’s terrible. God bless Donald Trump,” Jones said with a laugh.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2677c4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+289/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F71%2F415c5647430c8a0d0fd8011618c1%2Fsolarcuts-09xx25-07.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:01:09.640497

If we want sustainable growth in Northwest Indiana, we must treat housing and placemaking as the building blocks of “real” economic development. Together, they turn addresses into neighborhoods and projects into places where people live, work and gather.

The Region’s current path makes the case plain: our market is tight, our communities are shifting, and our competitiveness hinges on how we align housing production with place-quality investments.

Clear market signals

In spring 2024, sellers in Northwest Indiana were securing 96% of their asking prices with just 2.1 months of inventory — a seller’s market buoyed by in-migration from Illinois.

Yet the housing pipeline still lags demand across product types. That is why community-minded projects matter.

The Region embraces this approach, as is evidenced by Michigan City’s approved Tryon Meadow — 218 units mixing rentals, townhomes and single-family homes — pairs new housing with walking paths and a neighborhood layout; Hammond’s Memorial Park Senior Residences and Townhomes proposal adds age-friendly units next to planned for-sale lots.

These are more than inventory improvements. They are placemaking choices that support workforce attraction, aging in place and neighborhood foot traffic — each a precondition for healthy local economies.

Strong sense of community

Decades of research show neighborhoods with strong collective efficacy — neighbors’ willingness to act for the common good — see lower rates of violence even amid economic disadvantage.

That safety dividend lowers operating risk for retailers and helps corridors retain patrons after 5 p.m., turning one-time visitors into regulars.

In other words, placemaking investments that meet individual and community needs generate positive social and economic outcomes such as crime prevention and market growth. Research shows that the combined influence of a community’s skills, resources and its shared commitment to creating a sense of community supports community resilience.

Civic infrastructure

If housing is the steel that we build with, then placemaking is the station-area design that connects us to our daily lives, and civic infrastructure is the network that ensures communities and their residents can function, collaborate and thrive. It can be thought of as soft infrastructure.

The challenge is to recognize that civic infrastructure is equally important, although less tangible. This network of relationships, organizations and shared spaces enables residents to act collectively — and it is as critical to market confidence as roads or fiber.

Ways to multiply the impact:

Create a regional civic leadership academy with IU Northwest and local foundations to train “civic entrepreneurs” to enhance our sense of community.

Measure civic health alongside GDP — publish an annual civic vitality index tracking association activity, volunteer hours and public-realm projects. We can build on the work of the Indiana Bar Foundation and the Indiana Civic Health Index.

Why? Because every dollar spent on facades or rail upgrades yields more when paired with social capital investments. Civic infrastructure is the multiplier that transforms placemaking projects into community-building engines, sustaining momentum and fostering trust.

Affordability fundamental

Nationally, the 2025 State of the Nation’s Housing documents record renter cost burdens and 30-year-low home sales. In Indiana, a worker must now earn $22.07 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom at fair-market rental rates.

The affordability gap limits families’ economic well-being and stability, constrains hiring, and lowers spending in our communities.

The fix is a unique combination of more housing in places that attract talent and support economic growth, while enhancing a sense of community that fosters trust and a belief in the future of the Region.

The opportunity

Northwest Indiana has the momentum to realize its potential. In this next phase, we continue to build on our successes and identify ways to strengthen our civic infrastructure. We can set housing targets and fund placemaking.

However, building civic infrastructure will require intentional actions on the part of all who live, work and play in the Region. It is not a by-product of economic development but rather a way in which we define who we are, what is important to us as a community, and how individuals can connect and participate in decision making that impacts their everyday lives.

Economic development is successful when it takes root in a place. When we build homes and belonging — walkable blocks, safe crossings, shaded sidewalks, and strong civic networks — we build an economy that lasts. •",https://media.nwindianabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29150235/2025_10_Viewpoint_Szarleta_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:01:44.372293

Anne Taylor smiled broadly, like a proud mama with bragging rights at a family reunion, as she ticked off Hammond’s commercial real estate development wins.

There were big catches, like landing Meats by Linz, which supplies meats to upscale restaurants, casinos, golf clubs and more. The company eventually bought 10 acres and brought 400 new jobs to Hammond, said Taylor, who is executive director of the city’s planning department.

United Hospital Services and Huhtamaki, a global food packaging supplier, also have been huge for the city.

And, there were small ones, like local mom-and-pop shops that bring something special to the community.

“We focus on developments that have a lot of jobs,” she said. “We love bringing jobs to Hammond, but we also continue to support local businesses.”

Ixxa Coffee, a stylish coffee shop and roaster that also sells plants and pastries, is one example. It opened its doors in a 1,000-square-foot shop in north Hammond in 2021.

From light industrial to office space, from warehousing to major and light manufacturing, down to small businesses and the local doctor’s office, defining commercial real estate, or CRE, is almost like nailing jelly to a wall — you’re not likely to catch it all at once.

Generally, area experts broke CRE into three main categories: office space, industrial and retail — with each having multiple subcategories.

From Hammond to South Bend, regional experts agree Indiana’s strengths are a business-friendly climate, infrastructure like good highways and freight and passenger rail lines, and access to Lake Michigan. This combination makes it attractive to do business in the Region.

“We’re often the first call when companies are looking to relocate or expand,” Taylor said, a sentiment shared by her colleagues across the Lake Michigan’s southern shore.

Growing CRE

Experts repeatedly described the state of Indiana as pro-business and a not-so-conducive environment in neighboring states, particularly Illinois.

Indiana’s lower taxes, good highway and rail infrastructure, lower workers compensation and more affordable workforce are big draws to the Region, according to area experts.

Affordable land prices and a business-friendly government mean more businesses come to the Region, but population increases also are a huge factor, said David Lasser, managing broker for Merrillville-based Commercial In-Sites.

When new people come in, they want restaurants, shops, doctors’ offices and more, and that creates higher demand for commercial development in the area.

“The main driving force that’s been good for Northwest Indiana for many years is a considerable amount of vacant land for development,” said Lasser, who’s been a broker for 37 years. “There’s an ever-growing wave, over at least the last 15 years, of people moving from Illinois to Indiana. Every time somebody builds a home or occupies an apartment unit, it’s that many more heads and bodies to go into restaurants and shops and fill office buildings.”

Antony Miocic, director of Latitude Commercial’s office group, described Northwest Indiana as a suburb of Chicago, but the similarities between the two areas stop there.

“We’re a suburban market,” he said. “We definitely feed off Chicago, for better or worse, so that helps us definitely versus other markets, being close to a large population center like that.”

Office spaces are doing well in Northwest Indiana, with occupancy rates hovering around 90 percent, Lasser said. That average covers Lake, Porter, La Porte, Jasper and Newton counties.

“This means buildings are full,” he said.

Costs count, and a report from Commercial In-Sites published last January indicated the asking price for full-service rental costs for office space in the company’s Lake County portfolio averaged $26.18 per square foot and $24.73 per square foot in Porter County.

By contrast, business renters in the Chicago area, which had a vacancy rate of about 17 percent, could expect an average asking price of $42.85 per square foot, according to the online Savills Research and Data Services.

Office space remains a draw in the Region, in large part because it’s significantly cheaper than in the big city, and the pandemic prompted some trends that affect Indiana today, Miocic said.

For example, when more employees began working from home, a professional services firm paying for office space in Chicago could move across the state line and pay a fraction of the rental costs, Miocic said.

“It’s going to be much cheaper here, so there was definitely that trend in 2020,” he said.

Site location

A big part of encouraging commercial real estate development is knowing what works and what is welcomed in the many communities that make up the Region.

“So, we work with the communities to help them identify where they want to grow and how, and we help them make it happen,” said Bailey Tombers, vice president of business development for the Lake County Economic Alliance.

Typically, businesses already located within the county will contact the LCEA if they want to relocate or expand in the area, but there are plenty of calls from other states, Tombers said. The alliance discusses the site location with individual communities to see if there’s a match in Lake County.

Tombers named community after community in Lake County, noting the kinds of CRE development they usually want.

In Gary, for example, with the Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana and the upcoming convention center, “they’re going to see rapid growth all around that area in a relatively short amount of time, which is going to be very positive for them, but the question is how do we help support that.”

Farther south, Crown Point officials have encouraged preparing land for development, and they’re looking at different businesses that could use easy access to Interstate 65 and other infrastructure.

“The developers are working really well with the city to make sure that land is shovel ready,” Tombers said. “They’re putting up buildings and people are coming to look at them.”

One common refrain among communities in the state’s northwest corner, historically home to pollution belching mills, railroads and other heavy manufacturing, is a move toward something cleaner, she said.

“The communities are really trying to transition away from things that are going to have air emissions,” according to Tombers. “They’re tired of having the reputation of being the place where dirty things go. They like what they have, but they’re trying to diversify their economic clusters.”

About 45 minutes to the east, CRE brokers and experts also consider communities’ needs and interests when helping companies expand or relocate to the area, said Shawn Todd, a longtime broker with Cressy Commercial Real Estate.

Different communities have different personalities, and it’s important to recognize that and guide appropriate businesses toward the communities that fit them, he said.

Elkhart, long known as the recreational vehicle capital of the world and a spot for automotive industry businesses, continues to be heavier in manufacturing, while the South Bend area leans toward office and professional spaces.

“Downtown South Bend is just a different area than Elkhart or even Mishawaka,” Todd said.

Office space

The pandemic upended a lot, including the traditional demand for office space. More people who worked in offices began working from home, but that’s beginning to change too, Todd said.

“This need for private office space is not as much as it was before, and it’s an expense on people’s books they now look at differently,” he said. “Before, they thought they had to have (office space), and now maybe they see they don’t have to have it anymore.”

Still, more businesses are getting tired of having meetings in local coffee shops and restaurants, and they seem to be requiring workers to return to their offices more.

While office rental rates are holding steady, office vacancy is still higher than it should be in the St. Joe area, so that’s unfortunate for the office market, and the rates of office space deals have slowed down recently, Todd said.

“The velocity of deals is not there right now,” he said. “It used to be you could count on a certain number of deals happening each year, but it’s not really happening anymore. It is more challenging. The odd thing is we haven’t seen leasing rates really drop.”

Steel, data distribution

Steel manufacturing, with mills of various sizes dotting the lakeshore and its court of rail and other supporting businesses, still may be the Region’s economic king, but big data and distribution are eyeing the throne.

“We still do steel,” said Lasser, of Commercial In-Sites. “I’m told we make more steel of a higher quality than ever before, however, with less employees due to technology. Steel drives a lot of local vendors.”

Indiana still leads the nation in steel manufacturing, according to the Indiana Economic Digest and the American Iron and Steel Institute. U.S. Steel and Cleveland-Cliffs still run massive integrated steel mills along Lake Michigan’s southern shore, and there are plenty of more specialized mini-mills across the seven-county Region.

But, data and distribution are exploding in the area.

There have been giant distribution projects, recently, that capture the business imagination, like the 1-million-square-foot Amazon distribution center planned near I-65 and U.S. 30, the second such center in the area.

Another big catch is the Panduit distribution center — a $76.5 million, 475,000-square-foot behemoth — that will rise on Mississippi Street in Merrillville.

Proximity to Chicago makes Northwest Indiana more attractive, especially for warehousing and distribution businesses, Miocic said.

“We’re the crossroads of America,” he said. “We’re just a prime location for distribution centers. We have companies building (large structures) on spec, which is crazy, when you think about it, but they’re confident they’re going to find a tenant for them.”

Data centers are driving some economic growth in places to some extent, Todd said.

“We’re seeing it (in St. Joe County) and across NWI,” he said. “Data center activity is big. I don’t think there is a county in Northwest Indiana that doesn’t have a data center project.”

That’s not a bad thing, Lasser said. There’s a huge demand locally, regionally and nationally for data centers, even though they require huge amounts of power, and it means the Region is not putting all of its economic eggs in one basket.

“Diversification really helps the job market” Lasser said.

If you build it

Business parks and “spec buildings” still draw businesses to the area.

Spec properties are often massive structures developers build and subdivide to draw businesses. Sometimes, the developers don’t have to divide them at all.

Amazon opened a 190,000-square-foot distribution center at the AmeriPlex at the Crossroads park, built by Holladay Properties, in Merrillville in 2021, and this January, Amazon gobbled up a 1 million-square-foot building at The Silos at Sanders Farm development at the junction of I-65 and U.S. 30.

“Spec is still working,” said the LCEA’s Tombers. “It’s still very attractive. We see a lot of food production, packaging and those types of things. It’s making more sense in Lake County because of our proximity to Chicago.”

Headquartered in South Bend, Holladay Properties has dozens of development properties across Northwest Indiana, said Mike O’Connor, senior vice president of development and leasing.

Holladay also operates properties across several states, many of them mixed-use developments. Holladay broke ground on the 385-acre AmeriPlex at the Port in Portage in 2020, and they began building AmeriPlex at the Crossroads in Merrillville four years later.

“We try to have a pretty balanced portfolio. It’s somewhat influenced by the regional economy,” he said. “I would say we have more light industrial and medical office than residential in Northwest Indiana.”

Next up for Holladay Properties is another AmeriPlex-like business park in Michigan City. The company began developing the area after years of interacting with leaders in that city.

“It’s about aligning with interests in planning by the community,” O’Connor said. “We kind of stay close to the folks that are doing planning with local governments. There’s a great desire in Michigan City to create more opportunities for business growth, including light industrial flex space.”

Flex space is a versatile form of development that attracts a wide range of businesses, from office to warehousing, light industrial and distribution in a single area.

From business to community

Retail also is a big component of CRE, and it has the capacity to build communities where residents live, work and play.

Tucked into a strip mall, coffee shop Ixxa is within reach of a local plant of an international conglomerate that makes bar soap, a railroad yard, a casino and dozens of small businesses.

Jose Marin, who grew up in neighboring Whiting before moving to California, said he noticed a “missing link” in the community when he moved back to the area with his wife, Stephanie Mora.

“In every city where I’ve lived, whether it’s Los Angeles or London, there was always that part of the community that was important, and it was a coffee shop,” Marin said.

Marin and Mora decided to open their own unique coffee shop in 2021. Soon, they added a neighboring space in the strip mall to house their coffee roasting equipment, expanding the store by about 400 square feet.

Last year, they added an outdoor patio space. They could see the immense possibilities behind a community hangout, Marin said. One cool shop, restaurant or bar opens, and others soon follow.

“I’ve seen it before,” he said. “You see this thing that just happens in front of your eyes. The neighborhood can grow and grow and grow, and it all starts with someone in the neighborhood just starting a little community of their own.”

Taylor emphasized that small businesses are the key to commercial development. Getting people to live and work in Hammond requires services and activities that create a sense of community.

“We really want to see more amenities for people living in and moving to Hammond,” she said. •",https://media.nwindianabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/19173603/Amazon_Merrillville_Rick_Bella_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 20:03:07.623462

The Department of Energy announced late Wednesday that it would ax more than 300 grants, without naming them. A list circulating in Washington policy circles — and reported by my colleagues today — ranges from grid infrastructure upgrades and carbon capture demonstrations to building efficiency research and high-profile hydrogen hubs.

What do they have in common? Almost all are in states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“It shows the political retribution is more important than serving the American people,” a former DOE staffer told POLITICO’s E&E News. “Either that or they are deeply uninformed about the power sector.”

The Trump administration hasn’t confirmed any of the specific cuts, and several grantees said today that they hadn’t heard from DOE.

But President Donald Trump has made it clear he plans to use the government shutdown to dismantle federal programs and target funding that isn’t in line with his agenda. Trump wrote this morning on Truth Social that he would meet with White House budget chief Russ Vought to determine “which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.”

“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” Trump added.

Carbon removal, hydrogen at risk

Among the reported cuts were at least 10 of 21 DOE-backed direct air capture projects — aimed at sucking carbon dioxide from the sky. Some scientists see the emerging technology as a necessary tool to avoid dangerous global warming.

Most of the carbon-removal projects slated for elimination are intended for Democratic-led states, although one was developed by a California company in Wyoming (the company had already backed out). Projects pursued by companies close to the administration — such as Chevron and Fervo Energy — were absent from the list, as were a handful of projects in states like Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. Also on the chopping block: more than $2 billion for two West Coast hydrogen hubs from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The affected projects in California and the Pacific Northwest aim to demonstrate “green” hydrogen, which uses renewable power to produce a clean alternative to fossil fuels.

Political blowback

Democrats were quick to criticize the cuts, which they said would raise power prices and hurt reliability at a time when electricity demand is skyrocketing.

Take a $600 million grant to California to upgrade 100 miles of electricity transmission lines. The funding was among several grants on the list of cuts from DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Program, which backs projects to shield power infrastructure from extreme weather and reduce outages.

Democrats have also pointed out that the cuts would hurt Republican districts as well. The reported list includes projects in Iowa, Florida and Arizona — which all backed Trump — and others would have had partnerships or outposts in red states. A breakdown from Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said at least 28 GOP districts would see funding cut, plus 108 Democratic districts.

“The Trump Administration continued its assault on cheap energy today, canceling projects designed to lower electricity bills while wasting your taxpayer dollars in the process,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.).

Thune says Republicans ‘don’t control’ White House budget chief

Senate Majority Leader John Thune warned Democrats today that Republicans “don’t control” White House budget chief Russ Vought.

In an exclusive interview, Thune tried to distance himself from the White House’s slash-and-burn response to the government shutdown, writes Jordain Carney. Some Republicans have expressed discomfort with Vought’s promises to conduct mass firings and cut funding for everything from transportation projects to research programs.

“This is the risk of shutting down the government and handing the keys to Russ Vought,” Thune said, adding that “there should have been an expectation” among Democrats that Vought could broadly target government workers and programs in a shutdown.

Climate cuts deepen

The government shutdown isn’t stopping the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back work on climate change, a whole gaggle of our reporters write.

For example, about half of the Interior Department’s staff will be furloughed, but work will continue on fossil fuel permitting projects. Its Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, meanwhile, “will cease all renewable energy activities” but continue work on oil and gas lease sales, according to its shutdown plan.

Just one staffer will be left to work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Climate and Health Program. And the U.S. is not expected to send a delegation to international climate talks in Brazil next month, in part because State Department offices that usually participate are now closed.

A peek behind the staffing curtain

Federal agency shutdown plans are offering new insight into how the federal workforce has shrunk during the second Trump administration, write Jennifer Yachnin, Hannah Northey and Kevin Bogardus.

The plans show that the Environmental Protection Agency has shrunk about 10 percent, the Energy Department nearly 13 percent and the Interior Department 14 percent, compared with September 2024 federal employee data.

More than 201,000 civilian workers have left the federal government since Trump took office, according to data compiled by the Partnership for Public Service.

“What’s always interesting to see is how many employees there are at each agency, and the numbers are smaller. You can clearly see that workforce numbers have been reduced,” said Jenny Mattingley, the Partnership’s vice president of government affairs.

The Complaint alleges that EPA has violated the Clean Air Act by failing to make a determination of attainment, or finding of failure to attain, for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQAS”) in the San Joaquin Valley.

Particulate matter is a generic term for a broad class of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist as discrete particles (liquid droplets or solids) over a wide range of sizes.

States are primarily responsible for ensuring attainment and maintenance of NAAQS once the EPA has established or revised one. Each state is then required to formulate, subject to EPA approval, an implementation plan (i.e., “SIP”) designed to achieve each NAAQS. The SIP is required to attain an individual NAAQS within the air quality region within a certain period of time. Failure to do so requires that EPA within a certain period of time classify it as nonattainment.

The Sierra Club Complaint states that EPA established an NAAQS for PM2.5 of 35 µg/m3 averaged over a 24-hour period in 2006. Further, the agency is stated to have approved California’s request for a maximum five-year extension of the applicable serious area attainment date, extending the attainment date from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024.

The Complaint further alleges:

...EPA shall, as expeditiously as practicable but no later than June 30, 2025, determine whether the San Joaquin Valley attained, or failed to attain, the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 standard. To date, EPA has failed to make an attainment determination.

EPA is alleged to have failed to make an attainment determination, violating the Clean Air Act.

The Complaint requests that the Court declare that EPA has a duty by June 30, 2025, to make a determination and that the agency continues to violate the Clean Air Act by failing to make an attainment determination. Further, the Court is requested to issue preliminary and permanent injunctions directing EPA to take final action on the attainment determination for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 standard by December 1, 2025.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 05:59:05.821171

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified.
Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

President Donald Trump’s energy policy leans heavily on fossil fuels and dials back the growth in renewables.

Yet West Virginia is one of the nation’s top states in the growth of clean energy jobs.

Curtis Tate spoke with Bob Keefe, the executive director of E2, a group that supports clean energy development, about what recent changes mean for the state and country.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.

Keefe: As you saw from our numbers, there’s more than almost 11,000 people, 11,000 West Virginians that now work in clean energy one way or another in that state. And that’s energy efficiency. It’s not necessarily that the typical solar panel installer or the wind turbine guy, right? These are energy efficiency jobs, folks making what I believe is one of the oldest housing stocks in the country, in West Virginia, more efficient and saving consumers money on their power bill every year. That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.

But it is solar workers. You had three or four major solar plants open up just in the past six, eight months, in the past year anyway, in places like in Berkeley County, where a new solar plant just opened up on land that I think was formerly a storage site for coal ash.

You got factory workers at places like Form Energy in Weirton, which obviously is a big deal – 450 or so workers now making next generation batteries and what used to be a shuttered steel mill. Just like the rest of the country, these jobs are growing. They’re growing faster than the economy generally.

Tate: The governor wants to expand energy production with fossil fuels and nuclear. He didn’t mention renewables.

Keefe: Which is unfortunate. When you look across the country, 90% of all new power that was added onto the grid last year was solar, wind and batteries. This is where the country’s moving. This is where the world’s moving. I don’t live in West Virginia. I lived in North Carolina for a long time, one of the biggest solar states in the country. I grew up there. And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia. And there’s no reason that the governor needs to continue to tie the energy sources for West Virginians to what has become the most expensive power available.

Tate: Form is building batteries in Weirton. Aren’t those becoming a bigger part of the grid?

Keefe: It’s getting better every day thanks to innovation at companies like Form. I know it’s probably a dirty word, but I’ll bring up California. California now gets about 60% of all of its energy from renewables and batteries on a daily basis. There are many days when the state produces more than 100% energy from solar, wind, and batteries keep the lights on at night.

This is that we’re talking about the fourth biggest economy in the world, in California, and they’re doing it by not adding gas, not adding nukes, not adding coal. They’re doing it strictly through renewables. Look at other countries. They’re doing the same thing. There are other states. Look at Texas. Texas is the number one wind state in the country. I think it’s about to be the number one solar state in the country. It’s also going to be the number one state for battery deployment. There should be nothing political or partisan about creating jobs, driving economic growth and producing cheaper, cleaner energy.

Tate: What’s happening in the rest of the world, especially China?

Keefe: China is adding more clean energy than any place in the world right now. They’re exporting more clean energy products than any place in the world right now. Right now, 90% or so of all solar panels come from China and a few other countries. 90% of all batteries come from China and a few other countries. Finally, America is getting in the game, and it’s happening right there in West Virginia. We’ve got companies like Form that are creating new batteries across the country in the past three years.

I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country. Form there in West Virginia, but certainly battery factories across the country. I think there’s 50 or 60 battery plants that have been announced. There’s 60 solar panel factories that have been announced. There’s 120 electric vehicle related factories that have been announced. This is how America gets back in the game.

Along the Mississippi River.

The properties consist of well-managed, high quality timberlands. Molpus believes these timberlands present a desirable investment opportunity because they are strategically located in areas with diverse and numerous pulpwood, plywood, and dimensional lumber facilities, strong mill proximity and growth potential. The timberlands also present potential diversified income opportunities such as solar projects, carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, recreation income, and pine straw harvesting.

Molpus’s vertically integrated team will oversee the management of these timberlands including daily operations such as planning sustainable harvests, reforesting and nurturing young stands, and protecting wildlife habitat and water resources.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects.
Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES.
The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified.
Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

What’s in the Plan: Current EV Trends & Future Demand: EV ownership in Jefferson County tripled between 2021 and 2024, signaling the need for a major scale-up in public charging infrastructure to meet projected growth through 2040.
“We’ve heard from residents, community organizations, and key stakeholders across Louisville,” said Katie Littman, Deputy Director for the Cabinet of Economic Development.
The investment secured 2,200 local jobs and put Louisville firmly at the forefront of Ford’s EV rollout.
Louisville Metro DOT is part of the department of Public Works.","“Louisville continues to innovate, set ambitious goals, and lead with purpose,” said Mayor Craig Greenberg. “This plan is about building a city that works better for everyone. A city where clean air, smart infrastructure, and economic opportunity go hand in hand. We’ve had meaningful conversations with the public and we invite everyone to stay involved and help guide the next steps.”

Louisville hired AECOM and EHI Consultants in November of 2024 to help create a two-part EV Readiness Plan. The draft of the community plan outlines recommendations and strategies to expand public EV infrastructure and remove barriers to EV adoption. A forthcoming component of the plan outlines steps needed to transition the city’s fleet to zero-emission vehicles. Together, both components support the city’s sustainability goals of achieving 100% clean energy for Metro Government operations by 2035 and 100% community-wide by 2040.

What’s in the Plan:

Current EV Trends & Future Demand: EV ownership in Jefferson County tripled between 2021 and 2024, signaling the need for a major scale-up in public charging infrastructure to meet projected growth through 2040.

Community Voices and Ideas: Insights from surveys, focus groups, and stakeholder engagement shaped the plan’s priorities, identifying barriers such as cost, EV range concerns,and lack of home charging access.

Infrastructure Gaps & Priority Areas: The plan pinpoints areas most in need of charging stations, including multifamily housing, employment hubs, shopping destinations,and historically underserved neighborhoods.

Implementation Strategies: Outlines actions guiding a citywide EV transition, including public-private deployment models, workforce training, permitting reform, and funding pathways.

“We’ve heard from residents, community organizations, and key stakeholders across Louisville,” said Katie Littman, Deputy Director for the Cabinet of Economic Development. “They told us where charging is needed, the barriers that stand in the way, and how we can make this transition work for everyone in our city.”

The Cabinet for Economic Development assembled a steering committee of internal agencies to lead this process, including the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Facilities and Fleet. The Department of Transportation will lead implementation moving forward.

The release of the draft plan follows a major announcement from Ford Motor Company. In August, Ford announced it will invest $2 billion to retool Louisville’s Assembly Plant for electric vehicle production. The investment secured 2,200 local jobs and put Louisville firmly at the forefront of Ford’s EV rollout.

Residents, businesses, and organizations are encouraged to review the plan and share feedback. The public comment period is now open and will run through Friday, October 31. Click here to view the EV Readiness Plan.

The Metro Cabinet for Economic Development leads efforts to grow a more inclusive, innovative, and resilient local economy through strategic planning, public-private partnerships, and community engagement to attract investment, support entrepreneurs and expand access to opportunity across all neighborhoods.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office.
The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases.","Coloradans’ window to receive thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles has closed. But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/7/2025/10/02151148/EV-1024x699.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 18:03:18.722634

Meeting North Carolina’'s energy needs, he said, “Also means welcoming companies with net-zero emission targets and creating more opportunities to grow our already strong clean energy economy.” There are nearly 110,000 clean energy jobs in the state.
To accomplish these tasks, Wilson said, “We must ramp up our clean energy projects, modernize our electrical grid, and continue innovating in energy efficiency and energy conservation.
The state Energy Office is investing $20 million in seven projects to update infrastructure around the state.
I think we all recognize the path to prosperity runs directly through a clean energy economy.”","Governor Josh Stein said via a video message today that North Carolina’s energy demands are rapidly rising and its power generation and grid must be prepared for the growth it is experiencing.

The governor made his video message for the Center for Energy Education’s EnergyFEST, which was played before North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson gave his keynote address.

“That means rebuilding critical infrastructure in western North Carolina and adapting to a change in climate so that North Carolina remains resilient into the future,” the governor said.

The need for these improvements has been made clear “in the wake of action by the federal government and by our own General Assembly that threatens to stifle the clean energy economy and raise our utility bills.”

In August, Stein launched the Energy Policy Taskforce in an effort to lower energy bills for North Carolina families and promote renewable energy. “When we have lower emissions and improve energy efficiency, everyone benefits.”

Stein said earlier this year the state launched the Energy Saver NC rebate program, which rewards households for installing energy-efficient appliances, improving home insulation, and upgrading electrical systems.

Meeting North Carolina’'s energy needs, he said, “Also means welcoming companies with net-zero emission targets and creating more opportunities to grow our already strong clean energy economy.”

There are nearly 110,000 clean energy jobs in the state. “We need to work together and continue our support for investments in that economy so that we can push that number higher.”

Stein said North Carolina is and will continue to be a leader in the clean energy economy “because it’s an investment in our people and our future.”

Wilson

Wilson, who has been on the job for nine months, said, “From day one there was one thing that was crystal clear, and that is that our department makes peoples’ lives healthier and better every single day in all 100 counties. Every day we are working to safeguard our air quality, water quality, and making sure our lands are healthy.”

The secretary said Stein is committed to expanding the state’s economy and creating good-paying jobs, especially in clean energy, and to reducing greenhouse gases and other air, water, and chemical pollution.

To accomplish these tasks, Wilson said, “We must ramp up our clean energy projects, modernize our electrical grid, and continue innovating in energy efficiency and energy conservation. We need sufficient electricity to support economic growth, new industries, and a rapidly growing population — all the while keeping prices affordable in their homes.”

Wilson said it makes sense for the state to invest in clean energy. “We keep seeing increasingly devastating storms.”

Some of the biggest hurricanes in the state — Matthew, Florence, and Helene — were considered 1,000-year storms but all occurred within eight years. “The vast majority of the world’s climate experts agree that the cause of these more intense storms is in fact greenhouse gas emissions, so we really do need to keep investing in clean energy and driving down those emissions if we want to avoid the kinds of disasters we’ve seen in recent years.”

He said the state has received more than 5,400 applications for the Energy Saver NC program. “By investing in home energy efficiency and conservation, we are investing in people.”

The Weatherization Assistance Program helps 1,100 households per year become more energy-efficient. The state Energy Office is investing $20 million in seven projects to update infrastructure around the state.

The state has $5 million invested through regional partners in western North Carolina for microgrids.

In the last few years the state has seen more than $24 billion in clean energy investment, Wilson said, adding that over 15 years the state has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by around 50 percent.

The state is now at a point where renewable energy produces about 15 percent of the electricity generated.

Headwinds

There are headwinds, however. “The United States Department of Energy recently canceled our $156 million Solar for All program. We are contesting that with the EPA.”

The administration in Washington has canceled offshore wind projects and earlier this week announced a plan to increase coal as an energy source across the country. “Popular clean energy tax credits will expire in three months,” he said. “Duke Energy yesterday submitted their latest carbon plan to the Utilities Commission, and it extends the life of coal plants. It relies more on gas and puts off renewable investments for some time.”

And on the state level, Wilson said lawmakers passed a bill which removes the interim 70 percent reduction goal in carbon. “It does keep the zero carbon (target) by 2050 but it removes the interim goal, which we think would be important to keep having the foot on the gas to get it there in time by 2050.”

He said despite the obstacles, “We have to continue to prioritize energy efficiency, resilience, and clean energy deployment. We have to keep investing in the people of North Carolina, building opportunity in every county through clean energy. I think we all recognize the path to prosperity runs directly through a clean energy economy.”",https://www.rrspin.com/media/sigplus/preview/08708afcb21edef3485e3e01f9a8c4dd.jpeg,N,,2025-10-02 18:02:39.968881

“In a rational world, we're going to have wind development in North Carolina.” The Oct. 1 blueprint from Duke is a first draft.","When North Carolina’s GOP-led legislature nixed a key decarbonization deadline for Duke Energy in July, critics feared it would upend the state’s transition to clean energy.

Now, a proposal Duke just submitted to regulators shows they were right to worry as the utility, North Carolina’s largest, seeks to walk back its clean-energy ambitions and enact one of the most aggressive fossil-fuel expansions in the nation.

Without a mandate to cut climate-warming emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, the utility intends to build about half as much wind and solar capacity over the next decade compared to its previous trajectory. It also now aims to delay the construction of new nuclear power plants until later in the 2030s. Battery storage is the sole bright spot for clean energy in the blueprint — Duke wants to invest in about 1.5 gigawatts more than it did before.

Meanwhile, the company proposes to extend the life of aging coal plants and develop more natural-gas units, bringing its total build-out of new fossil-fuel plants to 9.7 gigawatts by 2035 and as much as 12.3 gigawatts by 2040.

“It’s certainly a regressive vision for North Carolina’s energy future,” said Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.

Underlying Duke’s proposal is the unprecedented growth in electricity demand it expects from new large energy users, especially data centers. If the company’s “high load” projections materialize, its carbon emissions could rise by one-third or more by the middle of the next decade.

After that, greenhouse gases will “rapidly decline” as nuclear power plants come online, Dukes says in its proposal to regulators.

Critics say the increase in pollution puts a midcentury net-zero carbon target that remains in state law further from reach and burdens consumers with rising fuel costs.

“Delaying coal power plant retirements and adding new fossil generation is digging the hole deeper, not advancing toward where state law says we need to get,” said David Neal, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “We have to find a way to get on a path to 2050 compliance with fuel-free resources that we know will be in the best longer-term interests of customers.”

Duke’s proposed blueprint largely aligns with how experts predicted the company would behave without the 2030 deadline to curb greenhouse gas emissions. “This is just about what we expected,” said Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director with the Environmental Defense Fund.

The plan also reflects the federal government’s increasing hostility to renewable energy — and its unrelenting push to accelerate fossil-fuel use.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have in recent months slashed incentives and grant programs for clean-energy projects and, in some cases, moved to block in-progress installations.

At the same time, Trump has tried to prop up coal — the nation’s most expensive and polluting source of power — including via a Monday announcement of $625 million for the industry. As Duke notes in its plan, the administration has also relaxed other rules around carbon emissions and toxic ash from coal plants, although a future president could reverse course.

Duke is responding accordingly. The company now wants to keep 4.1 gigawatts of its coal fleet running longer than it previously planned, instead of investing in proven clean-energy technology, said Mikaela Curry, manager for Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. “It’s just so frustrating,” she said.

“It’s clear that national political sentiment is making its way into this plan,” said Brooks. “I don't know what else accounts for prolonging coal, because the economics are certainly not on its side.”

Before the rollback of the state climate law, cuts to federal incentives for renewables, and Trump’s particularly vicious attacks on wind energy, Duke had planned to add 13.2 gigawatts of solar and 4.5 gigawatts of onshore and offshore wind by 2035, according to the state’s nonpartisan customer advocate, Public Staff. Now, the utility envisions 9.2 gigawatts of solar — and no wind at all until at least 2040.

“That’s clearly a response to political winds and not our resource winds,” Brooks said. “In a rational world, we're going to have wind development in North Carolina.”

The Oct. 1 blueprint from Duke is a first draft. Now, clean-energy advocates begin the arduous work of combing through the utility’s modeling assumptions and dozens of portfolios.

In a news release, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, described “Donald Trump’s decision to cancel 223 energy projects in 21 states” as “nakedly political, unhinged, and unlawful.

In a post on social media, Russell Vought, director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, listed 16 states in which grants had been canceled, including New Mexico, and wrote: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” An Associated Press story identified the states as ones that had all voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The grants were through DOE’s Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Grid Deployment; Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; and Fossil Energy.

The source would provide a comparison of pre-project actual emissions with projections of post-project actual emissions to determine whether any proposed construction would result in a significant emissions increase.
This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.
Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning.
By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects.","In support of the administration’s efforts to facilitate the development of data centers, on September 15, 2025, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced at a White House artificial intelligence roundtable that the agency plans to readopt a 2017 memo issued by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (the Pruitt Memo) concerning the Clean Air Act's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program. The Pruitt Memo, which was rescinded by the Biden administration in 2022, provided that EPA would not “second-guess” pre-project emissions projections made by permit applicants and/or state permit writers, providing applicants and state permitting agencies increased latitude in determining whether certain projects triggered NSR requirements.

Though presented as an effort to cut red tape for projects powering artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and data centers, readoption of the Pruitt Memo would have implications well beyond the AI realm, including the permitting of traditional sources typically subject to NSR. By potentially streamlining NSR permitting processes and shielding certain permitting decisions from federal scrutiny, the policy change could provide entities looking to modify sources that may have otherwise been considered a major modification increased certainty and flexibility by allowing them to work dependably alongside local environmental agencies to ensure projects are below emissions permitting thresholds.

There are at least two immediate impacts of this readoption—first, entities constructing new projects will have greater flexibility in the planning for permitting a new source to reduce the burdens and impacts of the permitting process required under old NSR guidelines. For instance, under NSR regulations, for existing sources contemplating a modification, an Actual-to-Project-Actual Applicability (APTA) test is utilized to determine whether a proposed project triggers NSR permitting requirements. The source would provide a comparison of pre-project actual emissions with projections of post-project actual emissions to determine whether any proposed construction would result in a significant emissions increase. Under previous regulations, a facility would estimate what its actual air pollution levels would be after a proposed modification, and EPA could question any assumptions made by the facility used in estimating those post-modification actual emissions. This ability to question emissions calculations allowed EPA to delay construction projects before they began.

Second, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo means EPA will not second-guess project emissions projections provided by the applicant unless there is a clear error or violation of procedural requirements, providing the source with much greater leeway in avoiding the typical NSR permitting process for new projects. Reducing EPA’s role in assessing the NSR applicability calculations has both a temporal and substantive impact on project planning. Project applicants will have greater certainty with respect to the timing of the process, and it will facilitate modifications where the state permitting agency and applicant agree on the calculations demonstrating no significant emissions increases.

Ultimately, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo appears encouraging for project proponents, who should experience more flexibility in developing applications that would not trigger NSR and should be able to receive permits in less time. If EPA is essentially precluded from second-guessing the emissions estimates and subsequent decisions of state permit writers who determine whether certain projects rise to the level of a “major modification” that would require additional NSR review absent clear error, there should be more certainty in the permitting process and less time spent waiting for EPA review.

Overall, the readoption of the Pruitt Memo may provide new opportunities for entities looking to complete source modification projects to do so with increased certainty and flexibility through cooperation with local environmental agencies. By creating clearer regulatory pathways and trusting states to handle permitting processes at the local level, the readoption should provide opportunities to streamline the planning and construction process for any emission source modification projects. This decision by EPA, which is being described as a necessary catalyst for projects powering AI infrastructure and data centers, may therefore result in shorter process for not only AI-focused projects but for the entire industrial sector.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/abstract-conceptual/green_508443891_largetile.jpg?rev=9014d429972a45f994cc3f28f5629e9c&hash=F7D4B0D5D6E16E7E9A7ACDE4AB94BD2D,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:42.859305

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov.
The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30.
Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office.
The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases.","Coloradans’ window to receive thousands of dollars in federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles has closed. But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/10/02142753/EV-1024x699.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:15.693129

AG Rokita said these regulations restrict Hoosiers’ ability to access affordable vehicles and hurt Indiana’s small businesses in the manufacturing and industrial industries.
“These rules are a bureaucratic power grab that burdens hardworking Hoosiers and families with unaffordable regulations,” Rokita said.
AG Rokita says even if the U.S. stopped all car emissions, it wouldn’t noticeably change global temperatures.
AG Rokita says these rules inflate car prices, hitting low-income Hoosiers hardest and keeping older vehicles on the road.","HENDERSON, Ky. (WEHT) – Attorney General Todd Rokita and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) Commissioner Clint Woods are championing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) plan to repeal climate regulations for cars and trucks.

According to AG Rokita, these regulations, which he says cost Americans $54 billion annually, rest on the Obama EPA’s 2009 decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. AG Rokita said these regulations restrict Hoosiers’ ability to access affordable vehicles and hurt Indiana’s small businesses in the manufacturing and industrial industries.

“These rules are a bureaucratic power grab that burdens hardworking Hoosiers and families with unaffordable regulations,” Rokita said. “By scrapping it, the EPA would be restoring common sense, the rule of law, and American energy independence. We fully support the rollback to restore polices that put our country back on the path to prosperity and protect Hoosier workers.”

Officials say the letter argues the Obama EPA misused a statute that Congress designed in the 1960s and 1970s to tackle local problems like smog, not global warming. AG Rokita says recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that EPA cannot regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases based on speculative concerns about their indirect effects on the environment.

Attorney General Rokita added that the rule’s science is shaky, relying on what he calls “outdated predictions that overstate” CO2’s impact. AG Rokita says even if the U.S. stopped all car emissions, it wouldn’t noticeably change global temperatures. AG Rokita says these rules inflate car prices, hitting low-income Hoosiers hardest and keeping older vehicles on the road.

“The U.S. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding and its resulting greenhouse gas regulations exceed the Agency’s limited authority under the Clean Air Act and suffer from significant scientific, procedural, and legal defects,” said IDEM Commissioner Woods. “Given Indiana’s primary responsibility for air pollution control, its proven track record of improving air quality, and its bottom-up success in reducing greenhouse gases without federal overreach, IDEM strongly supports reconsidering these heavy-handed standards that impose costs on Hoosiers without delivering measurable environmental benefits.”

Tesla has been under pressure this year due to uneven sales in the U.S. and falling sales globally.","After a sluggish and uneven year of sales so far, Tesla set a new record for deliveries in the third quarter with nearly half a million electric vehicles sold globally.

The automaker said on Thursday that it delivered 497,099 EVs between July and September, a 7.3% year-over-year increase and a new high for its EV sales.

The Model Y and the Model 3 accounted for the vast majority of these sales. The two EVs combined for 481,166 units delivered, which is more than 9% year-over-year growth, benefitting from the last-minute sales rush in the U.S. before the federal tax credit ended on Sept. 30.

Deliveries of the Cybertruck, Model X and the Model S plummeted sharply compared to last year. Tesla categorizes these as ""other models,"" which accounted for just 15,933 deliveries, a 30% year-over-year drop.

The Model X and Model S also received a mild refresh this year. Tesla does not release the production and delivery numbers for individual models. Here are the full results for the quarter:

The overall deliveries seem to have exceeded Wall Street expectations, which Reuters estimated at about 441,500, citing market intelligence firm Visible Alpha.

Tesla has been under pressure this year due to uneven sales in the U.S. and falling sales globally. Once an EV sales leader in Europe, the automaker has lost ground to rivals such as BYD and Volkswagen. CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics has also hurt buyer sentiment on the continent.

The automaker's slowdown in Europe seems to have been partly offset by U.S. buyers that rushed to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit before the Trump administration ended it on Sept. 30.

Tesla is now amid a massive transition, focusing more on robotics and AI and less on its passenger vehicle business.

There's also a crucial shareholder vote coming up on November 6, when investors will vote for Musk's trillion-dollar compensation plan, which is tied to ambitious performance targets like 20 million vehicle sales, a fleet of one million robotaxis in commercial operation and a market cap of $8.5 trillion.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqgpX/s1/tesla-model-y.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 21:59:23.010722

The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel.
But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration.
In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states.
In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.","The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states.

Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.

The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.

But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration.

In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.

In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”

Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”

Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023.

Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.

Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too

A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million.

The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.

Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.

The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department.

Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt

The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.

Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.

“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs.

Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.

There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy.

Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.

“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydrogen-hub-3-2048x1176.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 17:02:28.110922

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the agency was “reviewing” the awards in May. He testified in Congress that his office would make a decision about many of them by the end of the summer, but this week’s terminations — amid the government shutdown — are the first announcement the agency has made since an initial batch of cuts at the end of May.

2. The Big Apple is paying the price for the government shutdown

The Trump administration said Wednesday that it is putting $18 billion in funding for New York City transit projects on hold while it investigates violations of a rule barring diversity considerations in hiring that the Department of Transportation published on Tuesday. “The timing is, shall we say, noteworthy,” my colleague Matthew Zeitlin wrote on Wednesday, “not least because the Democrats’ two top congressional negotiators — Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer — are both from New York.” In a statement, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy blamed those two lawmakers for the shutdown, lamenting that thanks to them, “USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time.”

3. Blackrock to buy AES

Blackrock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners, an investment fund, is in talks to buy energy developer AES for more than $38 billion in “what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers of all time,” according to the Financial Times. AES owns utilities in Ohio and Indiana in addition to owning both conventional and renewable energy generation projects across the globe. The company is also the top supplier of renewable energy to corporate buyers in the world. AES stock jumped nearly 17% on Wednesday on the news.

4. More data on data center costs

A new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that residential customers in seven states that are part of the PJM Interconnection, an electricity market that covers the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, are paying nearly $4.4 billion for transmission upgrades intended to deliver electricity to data centers. The finding is not a big surprise — PJM’s own Market Monitor has acknowledged that data center load growth is the primary factor driving up rates. But the report specifically analyzes the amount the whole ratebase is shelling out for transmission projects that only benefit a single customer. It recommends that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission create a new customer class for such customers and require them to shoulder the cost alone.

5. Carbon cycle research gets a cash infusion

Trump has slashed millions in grants for climate science research and plans to cut the federal government’s climate science funding and staff dramatically in next year’s budget. Stepping in to replace some of that lost cash is Schmidt Sciences, a philanthropy founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Schmidt announced Thursday that it’s committing up to $45 million over five years for research to advance understanding of some of the least-studied parts of the global carbon cycle. For example, one project will measure how much carbon dioxide the Southern Ocean absorbs from the atmosphere with the help of robotic sailboats that can collect data year-round, including during times when it’s too dangerous for research ships to operate.

Hyundai is cutting the price tag on its 2026 Ioniq 5 by nearly $10,000, and will continue to offer $7,500 off the 2025 model — equivalent to the now-expired federal tax credit. The 2026 Ioniq 5 base model will start at just $35,000, making it one of the cheapest EVs available in the U.S.

“We are in a unique moment right now,” Carmichael Roberts, a managing partner at BEV told me via email. “Over the past decade, the climate tech ecosystem has made enormous progress driving innovation across every sector of the economy. That puts us in the position to step back and ask first, what areas are still crying out for urgent innovation?”

This year has also seen a number of climate tech companies struggle at key points in their attempts to scale. Sodium-ion battery company Natron Energy shut down in September, while direct air capture leader Climeworks laid off 22% of its staff in May, citing “current macroeconomic uncertainty” and “shifting policy priorities where climate tech is seeing reduced momentum.” Another direct air capture company, Noya, shuttered this August, while the battery recycling company Li-Cycle filed for bankruptcy in May.

Other startups pursuing emerging technologies — from carbon capture to long-duration battery storage, advanced geothermal, and next-generation nuclear — are looking to avoid the same fate. But while federal funding from places such as the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Loan Programs Office once provided an avenue for financing capital-intensive demonstration plants, the Trump administration is now retracting funding, going so far as to cancel contracts with projects previously approved under Biden.

The Oneworld fund, announced in mid-September, is BEV’s first to focus on a specific theme and its first to be backed by an industry coalition. Members of the Oneworld Alliance — which include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, and Cathay Pacific — had already committed to using SAF for 10% of their fuel by 2030, while also “playing an active role in the development of SAF at commercial scale.” Now, with alliance members serving as limited partners in the venture fund, they’ll benefit from the technical and commercial expertise of one of the sector’s most influential VC firms.

When I asked the BEV team to what degree the current political and economic uncertainties were making partnerships like this more valuable, Eric Toone, another BEV managing partner, responded with a refrain I’ve become familiar with — that the firm only backs technologies that “can ultimately compete on their own merits.” Yet it’s undeniable that the federal government tore up its decarbonization agenda at a moment when many climate tech firms’ investments are almost ready for deployment, a stage when government support can make all the difference.

“Many promising SAF technologies already exist, but they are stuck between lab success and commercial scale,” Roberts told me. “This is the moment when they most need capital, technical rigor, and committed offtake to bridge that gap.” While the Trump administration did maintain and extend the tax credit for clean fuels, it also reduced the maximum credit amount for SAF from $1.75 per gallon to $1, while private funding for SAF production and distribution infrastructure remains inadequate.

Given this landscape and the urgency airlines face in meeting their clean fuel targets, Toone told me the firm is open to backing companies “that are further along than what a typical BEV fund might pursue.” And while sustainable fuels are the first technology to benefit from this type of thematic focus, Roberts said that BEV is already eyeing other sectors where it plans to apply this same funding model.

As of early September, the firm is also part of the All Aboard Coalition. This elite group of venture firms is aiming to raise a $300 million fund by the end of October that will match investments in later-stage venture rounds, filling a gap known in climate tech circles as the “missing middle.” Assembled by Chris Anderson, an entrepreneur and primary convener of the TED Talks conference — which has featured many inspiring climate visionaries — the group includes 14 members such as Khosla Ventures, Prelude Ventures, DCVC, Gigascale Capital, and Energy Impact Partners.

“One of the consequences of being in the front row seat at TED all these years is you get persuaded of certain things,” he told me. “And I definitely got persuaded that climate is the outstanding, major problem we really have to fix.”

The bulk of the capital for the coalition will come from outside investors, though some members will contribute as well, Anderson told me. The goal is to incentivize these hotshots to co-invest with each other, providing a one-to-one funding match if they do so.

“First-of-a-kind rounds seem out of reach for a lot of people in the chain,” Anderson explained, referring to the network of investors that must come together to help a company fund expensive new infrastructure. At this stage, its tech has progressed beyond the capital-light, early-stage rounds but is still considered too risky for traditional infrastructure investors to take on. Companies might be seeking $100 million or more from venture firms that are used to writing checks for orders of magnitude less. “Really the purpose of the fund is to create a collective belief that there is a pathway to getting these companies funded. If you have that collective belief, then it’s much easier for a lead investor to step forward and to pull a few other people in.”

Anderson acknowledged that a $300 million fund will not go “nearly far enough.”

“It’s a starter fund. It’s a proof of concept,” he told me. “The world needs to make a couple hundred of these bets at some point.”

Other coalitions, such as the Climate Tech Atlas, are working to steer the sector towards the best bets. This group — which also includes Breakthrough Energy Ventures, alongside others such as the nonprofit investment platform Elemental Impact, the consulting firm McKinsey, and Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability — has mapped out the technological milestones it sees as the clearest pathways to decarbonization. The aim is to help investors, founders, policymakers and academics alike direct their energies towards the most relevant and investable opportunities, regardless of political headwinds.

“The scale at which the government participates in the development of these new technologies — or puts a thumb on the scale for technologies in particular — will vary,” Sonia Aggarwal, CEO of the policy firm Energy Innovation, which is also a member of the alliance, told me. “But certainly that has no real bearing on the fundamental fact that innovators are out there right now thinking about these grand challenges, and there are exciting new ideas for technologies that can get to that commercial scale in the coming years.”

And indeed, sometimes the most promising ideas can take shape in moments of deep uncertainty. Some of the biggest success stories of recent tech history — Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and Square — all got their start during the 2008 financial crisis or its aftermath. “Some of the strongest companies and founders are building in uncertain times,” Dawn Lippert, founder and CEO of Elemental Impact, told me. “That’s very much what we see right now.”

These groups are far from the only private-sector actors coming together to help navigate industry headwinds. When the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew support for the most widely used U.S.-based carbon accounting model for estimating scope 3 emissions, leading emissions accounting platform Watershed partnered with Stanford University’s Sustainable Solutions Lab to launch an initiative that ensures continued access. And recognizing the difficulty that early stage climate tech startups face in securing insurance, the nonprofit GreenRE Coalition and the philanthropic funder Trellis Climate partnered to create a new type of bond tailored to the needs of climate tech startups.

Whether it will all be enough to accelerate or even sustain much-needed momentum in climate tech funding is impossible to predict. But at least the private sector seems to agree that, in this moment, good old teamwork is worth one heck of a try.

While Vought did not refer to the government shutdown specifically in his announcement, the timing is, shall we say, noteworthy, not least because the Democrats’ two top congressional negotiators — Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer — are both from New York. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy later made the link explicit, clarifying in a statement that the real issue with the two projects was a recently released rule — as in, published on Tuesday — “barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.”

There would be a review of the two projects “to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring,” Duffy said, and “until USDOT’s quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed.” Those reviews “will take more time” thanks to the shutdown, he wrote, reaching his denouement, as “without a budget, the Department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review.”

The politics behind this gambit are obvious. President Trump has consistently threatened to withhold funding from states, cities, and institutions controlled by or connected to his political opponents.

“I think they very much understand the political dynamics of trying to make an example of New York. They understand where Chuck Schumer lives,” Jackson Moore-Otto, transportation fellow at the Center for Public Enterprise, told me.

The White House wasn’t exactly running away from the political implications of the denial of funding on Wednesday.Vice President J.D. Vance arched a metaphorical eyebrow during a press conference, saying that “I'm sure that Russ is heartbroken about the fact that he is unable to give certain things to certain constituencies.”

Trump has also specifically threatened federal funding for New York City if Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani wins the upcoming mayoral election.

Duffy himself could not have been any more obvious about what he is trying to achieve by slowing down this funding. “This is another unfortunate casualty of radical Democrats’ reckless decision to hold the federal government hostage to give illegal immigrants benefits,” his statement said, while also specifically calling out the two Democratic congressional leaders, saying that the delayed review was “thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies [sic] shutdown.”

The legality of this — and its legitimate connection to the shutdown — is not so clear.

“It’s pure political maneuvering if you read the statement closely,” David Super, a law professor at Georgetown, told me. “They’re trying to blame the shutdown for slowing their review, but they’re also effectively saying that they’re considering New York in violation of their standards.”

Super also flagged several constitutional and legal issues with the action.

“The funding allocated through laborious means to the Hudson tunnel and Second Avenue Subway is a property right that entities in New York have,” he told me. “The idea that that can be interfered with because someone wants to do an investigation is a blatant violation of due process.”

While it is possible that purported civil rights violations could lead to funding being blocked, “that would have to be established through procedure, not suspicions that they’re doing something wrong,” Super said.

The new rule Duffy referenced addresses a specific set of programs established under the Small Business Act that are designed to give organizations controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” i.e. “women and members of certain racial and ethnic groups,” a shot at winning government contracts.

The DOT argues that under these programs, “two similarly situated small business owners may face different standards for entering the program, based solely on their race, ethnicity, or sex,” and that the rules and legislation defining them violate equal protection as set out in recent federal court decisions and Trump executive orders.

The rule that Duffy cites as justification for his actions is itself constitutionally suspect, Super said. “The Administrative Procedure Act requires public comment on new rules, subject to limited exceptions,” which this did not have.

The slapdash way the rule has been rolled out could open up the DOT to lawsuits, whether from the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the New York City subway, or another entity involved with the Hudson tunnel project.

“Courts throughout history have insisted public comment is important,” Super said. The DOT is “violating procedures for issuing this policy and violating due process in the way they apply it.”

Moore-Otto also pointed out that the DOT release makes no specific claim that these projects are violating the rule.

“What they’re saying, it appears to me, is, New York might be doing this thing that we’ve just decided is illegal and we’re going to cut off your funding and it’s going to take longer because our lawyers aren’t being paid,” he said.

And there are broader issues around infrastructure policy at play beyond the obvious political gamesmanship, Moore-Otto pointed out. Duffy’s announcement links the supposedly unconstitutional women and minority contracting practices to the high costs that plague American infrastructure projects, saying they’re a “waste of taxpayer resources.”

But, Moore-Otto argued, what really ails U.S. infrastructure projects are extensive administrative reviews and the start-stop nature of project development.

“I think people would broadly agree the U.S. takes too much time and money to deliver infrastructure projects, and they are trying to invoke this as a pretext,” Moore-Otto said. “What strikes me as noteworthy is that when we look at why the U.S. does, in fact, take so long and use so much money building, while the rest of the world builds faster and cheaper, is that there’s a lot of stopping and starting of these infrastructure projects.”

“Assuming it’s a prolonged delay, it’s going to probably drive up costs — even though they’re saying it is a cost saving measure,” Moore-Otto added. “I think that should not be lost on anybody.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY5MjM2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5Njg2NTQxOH0.jSincWwC74Jrvcdup1GjXLhMkS7Up9_zu8MDeymAzlU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-02 18:02:50.063512

To keep up, Entergy Texas is moving forward with a major transmission project while also leveraging grant funding from the Texas Energy Fund to strengthen the grid and improve resiliency across its service territory.

Today, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project, better known as SETEX, and determined the route on which Entergy Texas is to build the transmission line. Additionally, the company was also awarded approximately $200 million from the Texas Energy Fund that will enable Entergy Texas to execute projects that will bolster grid resilience by upgrading and replacing equipment across the electrical system while prioritizing customer affordability. Together, these initiatives represent significant steps toward delivering reliable, affordable energy to meet the state’s growing needs.

“Receiving approval for a major transmission project and critical state funding demonstrates to our customers our commitment to further strengthen reliability and resiliency while staying focused on affordability,” said Eliecer Viamontes, CEO of Entergy Texas. “Growth in Southeast Texas is creating incredible opportunities for the communities we serve, and it’s our responsibility to ensure we build a resilient power grid that supports long-term economic expansion and future energy needs.”

Southeast Texas Area Reliability Project (SETEX)

The SETEX transmission line is a key part of the company’s Southeast Texas Energy Plan, also known as STEP Ahead, and includes a new 500-kilovolt transmission line connecting two new stations: Babel Switching Station in Newton County and Running Bear Substation in Montgomery County. The transmission line will span 145 miles through Jasper, Montgomery, Newton, Polk, San Jacinto, Trinity, Tyler and Walker counties.

Here’s how the project benefits customers and communities:

Builds new transmission infrastructure needed to deliver reliable power to fast-growing communities

Strengthens the grid and reduces the risk of widespread outages during extreme weather events like hurricanes or winter storms

Helps communities attract new employers, expand the local economy and create jobs

Improves service across the broader Midcontinent Independent System Operator transmission network, supporting reliability across the broader region

Meets federally required North American Electric Reliability Corporation reliability standards, ensuring long-term stability for customers

While the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, serves most Texans, Entergy Texas operates within MISO, a regional transmission organization that oversees energy planning across 15 U.S. states and Manitoba, Canada. SETEX was identified through MISO’s long-range planning process as critical to ensuring compliance with NERC baseline reliability standards and the provision of reliable and cost-effective service as demand continues to grow.

Field surveys for SETEX will begin in the coming months. Final engineering and materials procurement will be a focus in 2026, followed by construction of the new line and substations starting in 2027. The project is expected to be fully energized by the end of 2029. View the transmission route and learn more about the SETEX Area Reliability Project at EntergyTexas.com/transmission/setex.

Texas Energy Fund

Earlier this year, Phase I of the company’s Future Ready Resilience Plan was approved, and Entergy Texas has since pursued opportunities to obtain state grant funding to offset the cost of similar investments for customers. Today, the PUCT awarded Entergy Texas approximately $200 million from the Texas Energy Fund to bolster grid resilience and reliability across our service territory. This is another key milestone to achieving two steps of the company’s Southeast Texas Energy Plan, keeping electric rate’s affordable and protecting the power grid from extreme weather.

With these funds, the company will implement upgrades and replacements across the electrical system to improve resiliency and reliability – decreasing the number of customers impacted and the duration of outages following extreme events.

At no added cost to customers, over 9,000 structures and approx. 400 line-miles of transmission and distribution will be hardened, which are designed to prevent, withstand and mitigate the risks posed by hurricanes, ice storms, wildfires and other severe events.

“From the start, we have advocated for an all of the above energy strategy, including battery storage, renewables, nuclear, and natural gas, among other technologies, to create an affordable, reliable, sustainable, and equitable future,” Golden explained.

“The General Assembly owes it to ratepayers to thoughtfully consider this proposal before imposing what is essentially a 20-year tax on ratepayers.”

“The General Assembly rightly tabled this issue at the end of May. However, the current bill is essentially the same as the bill that was tabled and only guarantees immediate cost increases in exchange for the hope of possible savings years down the road. With an effective date of next year, we have the time to avoid mistakes made in other energy markets.”

“States like New York, Massachusetts, and California, among others, have adopted similar top-down battery storage programs. Consumers in those states pay rates that are up to twice as high as Illinois consumers pay today,” Golden said.

Attached is a chart showing the huge differences in costs between Illinois and the nine states that have approved similar battery storage legislation.

IIEC is a coalition of energy-intensive industries and institutions across Illinois. United by a shared interest in energy policy and advocating for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy supply, the IIEC actively engages in utility regulation and legislative initiatives at both the state and regional levels on behalf of energy consumers. The organization also serves as a central hub for tracking and responding to developments that impact utility ratepayers and its members.

The EPA proposal ignores decades of comprehensive, peer-reviewed science and relies almost exclusively on a draft report from the Department of Energy’s ‘Climate Working Group’, a since-disbanded group of five climate skeptics who do not represent scientific consensus. In their chapter on agriculture, the report’s authors go so far as to claim that “there is reason to conclude that on balance climate change has been and will continue to be neutral or beneficial for most US agriculture.”

The reality of farming in the United States tells a different story. Climate change is already disrupting agricultural production across most major crops and regions.

Due to climate change and depending on the region, farmers and farmworkers nationwide face:

Unprecedented heat and drought that have led to crop and livestock stresses, yield losses, and depleted surface and groundwater resources;

More intense weather and changing precipitation patterns, heavy rains, hurricane winds, and floods, as well as increasing pest pressures;

Decrease in quality and availability of forage; and

Rising hospitalizations and fatalities from heat and more airborne pollution (including wildfire smoke). These hazards disproportionately affect the 3 million farmworkers who do two-thirds of the labor to put food on American tables.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.
That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.
And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia.
I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country.","President Donald Trump’s energy policy leans heavily on fossil fuels and dials back the growth in renewables.

Yet West Virginia is one of the nation’s top states in the growth of clean energy jobs.

Curtis Tate spoke with Bob Keefe, the executive director of E2, a group that supports clean energy development, about what recent changes mean for the state and country.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: I was surprised to see West Virginia is one of the top 10 states for job growth in clean energy.

Keefe: As you saw from our numbers, there’s more than almost 11,000 people, 11,000 West Virginians that now work in clean energy one way or another in that state. And that’s energy efficiency. It’s not necessarily that the typical solar panel installer or the wind turbine guy, right? These are energy efficiency jobs, folks making what I believe is one of the oldest housing stocks in the country, in West Virginia, more efficient and saving consumers money on their power bill every year. That’s the biggest part of the clean energy sector nationally, and I believe, also in West Virginia.

But it is solar workers. You had three or four major solar plants open up just in the past six, eight months, in the past year anyway, in places like in Berkeley County, where a new solar plant just opened up on land that I think was formerly a storage site for coal ash.

You got factory workers at places like Form Energy in Weirton, which obviously is a big deal – 450 or so workers now making next generation batteries and what used to be a shuttered steel mill. Just like the rest of the country, these jobs are growing. They’re growing faster than the economy generally.

Tate: The governor wants to expand energy production with fossil fuels and nuclear. He didn’t mention renewables.

Keefe: Which is unfortunate. When you look across the country, 90% of all new power that was added onto the grid last year was solar, wind and batteries. This is where the country’s moving. This is where the world’s moving. I don’t live in West Virginia. I lived in North Carolina for a long time, one of the biggest solar states in the country. I grew up there. And I can tell you that the sun doesn’t shine any brighter in North Carolina than it does in West Virginia. And there’s no reason that the governor needs to continue to tie the energy sources for West Virginians to what has become the most expensive power available.

Tate: Form is building batteries in Weirton. Aren’t those becoming a bigger part of the grid?

Keefe: It’s getting better every day thanks to innovation at companies like Form. I know it’s probably a dirty word, but I’ll bring up California. California now gets about 60% of all of its energy from renewables and batteries on a daily basis. There are many days when the state produces more than 100% energy from solar, wind, and batteries keep the lights on at night.

This is that we’re talking about the fourth biggest economy in the world, in California, and they’re doing it by not adding gas, not adding nukes, not adding coal. They’re doing it strictly through renewables. Look at other countries. They’re doing the same thing. There are other states. Look at Texas. Texas is the number one wind state in the country. I think it’s about to be the number one solar state in the country. It’s also going to be the number one state for battery deployment. There should be nothing political or partisan about creating jobs, driving economic growth and producing cheaper, cleaner energy.

Tate: What’s happening in the rest of the world, especially China?

Keefe: China is adding more clean energy than any place in the world right now. They’re exporting more clean energy products than any place in the world right now. Right now, 90% or so of all solar panels come from China and a few other countries. 90% of all batteries come from China and a few other countries. Finally, America is getting in the game, and it’s happening right there in West Virginia. We’ve got companies like Form that are creating new batteries across the country in the past three years.

I don’t know if you have seen our Clean Energy Project Tracker, but you know, there’s been 400 major clean energy projects announced all over the country. Form there in West Virginia, but certainly battery factories across the country. I think there’s 50 or 60 battery plants that have been announced. There’s 60 solar panel factories that have been announced. There’s 120 electric vehicle related factories that have been announced. This is how America gets back in the game.

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles — the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away — whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community — dubbed New Isle — could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan — paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill — designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way — and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction — and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation causes rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, Louisiana, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a ""significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn't really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn't have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials — despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk — “were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s OCD, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in severe flood risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40% of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners report leaking doors, broken appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn't going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that's a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that's almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-driven relocation touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It's about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn't viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people's options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we're thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We're going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

‘This conversation is hardly happening’

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It's hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It's even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that's just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they're going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High insurance costs driving coastal retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners — yet — the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what's coming at us and they're saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we're outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can — or should — stay.

“The fact that it's going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn't like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything's back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it's too late.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f72a722/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+582/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F88%2F1e%2Faa5b6e324dcc85e82d110b2a3c14%2F062525-basinger-louisiana-123.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:02:36.520454

(Reuters) - announced record quarterly deliveries on Thursday, but concerns that an expiration of the U.S. tax credit for EVs would turn a rush of buying into a trickle weighed on its shares.

The Elon Musk-led carmaker went all in to drive sales before the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit, using a combination of discounts, financing deals, social media ads and customer emails.

""I’m skeptical that this will be sustainable and I think we could see a soft couple of quarters,"" said Elliot Johnson, chief investment officer at Evolve ETFs, which manages investments in Tesla.

The sales surge reflected pulled-forward demand, possibly to lock in incentives, rather than growing consumer interest, Johnson said, adding it would not be irrational for investors to ""sell the news"" and buy again next year.

Tesla shares were down 3.4% in afternoon trading. The stock has rallied recently - up nearly 14% this year as of Wednesday’s close - after the company’s board proposed a mega pay package for Musk, who has also bought more shares.

Tesla, like its rivals, received the credits from the government and used them to offer attractive leases. Following the expiry, Tesla has raised lease prices for its vehicles. The prices of Tesla vehicles, excluding the credit, remained unchanged.

On Thursday, the company said it delivered 497,099 vehicles for the three months ended September, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier, and well above Wall Street expectations of 443,919 vehicles.

The deliveries included 481,166 Model 3 compact sedans and its best-selling Model Y crossovers. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on October 22.

Strong demand for its refreshed Model Y helped sales in China, said Troy Teslike, an independent Tesla researcher.

It also began delivering the six-seat Model Y L in China in September, a family-focused variant aimed at boosting demand in the world’s largest EV market.

Europe, however, remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining ground in the hyper-competitive market.

The company’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

Tesla’s full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be about 1.61 million, roughly 10% below 2024, according to Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

Meanwhile, smaller rival on Thursday lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast, but beat estimates for quarterly deliveries owing to a boost in demand from buyers rushing to take advantage of tax credits.

MUSK AND TESLA

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500 billion mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

The company’s board has proposed a shareholder vote on a new CEO award that could grant Musk about 12% of the company, worth up to $1 trillion, if performance and valuation targets are met, including delivering 20 million vehicles over a 10-year period.

The billionaire has been positioning Tesla more as a technology company than an EV maker by focusing on AI-based self-driving systems, robotaxis and humanoid robots.

CHEAPER MODELS

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the U.S., pushing the timing by several months, with an eventual plan to build the variant in China and Europe.

Tesla said in June that it had made ""first builds"" of the vehicle, but would start selling it in the fourth quarter and ramp up output slower than planned.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

""The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The stripped-down version is designed to be roughly 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the U.S. by 2026, sources told Reuters earlier this year.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEL910JE_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:21.959629

Like many other regrettable regulations of recent vintage, the air conditioner provisions were part of the climate change agenda.
Specifically, the Biden EPA required that all new home air conditioning systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use agency-approved refrigerants that are supposedly climate friendlier than the ones that had been in use.

Installers say these climate rules have boosted the cost of a residential system by an average of $1,500, and that is on top of other federal regulations that have also raised air conditioning prices in recent years. Fortunately, the EPA has proposed a rule that would provide some relief, but additional steps may also be necessary.

Like many other regrettable regulations of recent vintage, the air conditioner provisions were part of the climate change agenda. Specifically, the Biden EPA required that all new home air conditioning systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use agency-approved refrigerants that are supposedly climate friendlier than the ones that had been in use. Since cooling equipment is engineered around the refrigerant, this necessitated a redesign of these systems. And, since the new refrigerants are considered mildly flammable, the change requires additional precautions during the installation process that add further to total bill. Making matters worse, one of the new and supposedly eco-friendlier refrigerants, R-454B, was in short supply and prices have skyrocketed, making last summer a particularly painful one for homeowners who needed to replace their air conditioning systems.

While the Biden EPA rule explicitly forbids the manufacture of the cheaper but supposedly less climate-friendly cooling systems as of January 1, 2025, it did allow equipment made before the deadline to be sold and installed up to one year after it. The proposed new rule would extend this deadline indefinitely. Similarly, the proposed rule extends the installed date deadlines for other categories of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, such as the equipment used in supermarkets.

This is a step in the right direction, but there are questions as to just how much of the legally produced pre-2025 equipment is still available. Indeed, there were signs that supplies of such systems were already in short supply during last summer. That is why additional steps may be needed to more fully protect homeowners against regulatory costs. This could include changing the deadline to allow additional manufacturing of the less expensive systems, as well as measures to alleviate refrigerant shortages.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1409343527-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:37.602367

About 43% of the 200 most damaging fires occurred in the last 10 years of the study.
In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year.
We’ve also got a strong trend of those conditions becoming more common as a result of climate change.
But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.","Washington — Earth’s nastiest and costliest wildfires are blazing four times more often now than they did in the 1980s because of human-caused climate change and people moving closer to wildlands, a new study found.

A study in the journal Science looks at global wildfires, not by acres burned which is the most common measuring stick, but by the harder to calculate economic and human damage they cause. The study concluded there has been a “climate-linked escalation of societally disastrous wildfires.”

A team of Australian, American and German fire scientists calculated the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 based on the percentage of damage to the country's Gross Domestic Product at the time, taking inflation into account. The frequency of these events has increased about 4.4 times from 1980 to 2023, said study lead author Calum Cunningham, a pyrogeographer at the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania in Australia.

“It shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that we do have a major wildfire crisis on our hands,” Cunningham said.

About 43% of the 200 most damaging fires occurred in the last 10 years of the study. In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year. From 2014 to 2023, the world averaged nearly nine a year, including 13 in 2021. It noted that the count of these devastating infernos sharply increased in 2015, which “coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions.” Though the study date ended in 2023, the last two years have been even more extreme, Cunningham said.

Europe and North America lead in the number of these economically damaging fires. It's especially worse in the Mediterranean around Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal and in the Western United States around California, because of the climate prone to sudden dryness, worsened by global warming, Cunningham said.

The researchers also found a tripling in how often a single fire killed at least 10 people, such as 2018's Paradise fire, 2023's Lahaina fire and those in Los Angeles in 2025.

Cunningham said often researchers look at how many acres a fire burns as a measuring stick, but he called that flawed because it really doesn't show the effect on people, with area not mattering as much as economics and lives. Hawaii's Lahaina fire wasn't big, but it burned a lot of buildings and killed a lot of people so it was more meaningful than one in sparsely populated regions, he said.

“We need to be targeting the fires that matter. And those are the fires that cause major ecological destruction because they’re burning too intensely,” Cunningham said.

But economic data is difficult to get with many countries keeping that information private, preventing global trends and totals from being calculated. So Cunningham and colleagues were able to get more than 40 years of global economic date from insurance giant Munich Re and then combine it with the public database from International Disaster Database, which isn't as complete but is collected by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.

The study looked at “fire weather” which is hot, dry and windy conditions that make extreme fires more likely and more dangerous and found that those conditions are increasing, creating a connection to the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

“We’ve firstly got that connection that all the disasters by and large occurred during extreme weather. We’ve also got a strong trend of those conditions becoming more common as a result of climate change. That’s indisputable,” Cunningham said. “So that’s a line of evidence there to say that climate change is having a significant effect on at least creating the conditions that are suitable for a major fire disaster.”

If there was no human-caused climate change, the world would still have devastating fires, but not as many, he said: “We’re loading the dice in a sense by increasing temperatures.”

There are other factors. People are moving closer to fire-prone areas, called the wildland-urban interface, Cunningham said. And society is not getting a handle on dead foliage that becomes fuel, he said. But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.

""This is an innovative study in terms of the data sources employed, and it mostly confirms common sense expectations: fires causing major fatalities and economic damage tend to be those in densely populated areas and to occur during the extreme fire weather conditions that are becoming more common due to climate change,"" said Jacob Bendix, a geography and environment professor at Syracuse University who studies fires, but wasn't part of this research team.

Not only does the study makes sense, but it's a bad sign for the future, said Mike Flannigan, a fire researcher at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Flannigan, who wasn't part of research, said: ""As the frequency and intensity of extreme fire weather and drought increases the likelihood of disastrous fires increases so we need to do more to be better prepared.""","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/02/PDTN/86482039007-ap-25275632106981.jpg?crop=5399,3037,x0,y281&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-02 17:02:51.420905

""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades.","The Department of Energy is cancelling more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.

The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a government shutdown and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought posted on the social media site X that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a news release that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""

The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:

Clean Energy Demonstrations, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Grid Deployment, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure

Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security

Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies

Fossil Energy, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.

Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, posted on X.

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought announced the funding freeze in a post on X.

Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, said on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.

The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to limit the construction of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they can be built quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

""Ripping funding away from only blue states will raise utility bills for EVERYONE,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on X. ""It's not rocket science.""

This award recognizes the program’s success in installing over 300 green infrastructure features across 40 residential properties in North Central Austin. The award was presented at the Texas Water Development Board meeting on Oct. 2, 2025, followed by a reception for winners.

“The Rain Catcher Pilot Program shows how small-scale, community-based solutions make an impact,” said Watershed Protection Manager, Jessica Wilson.

The Rain Catcher Pilot Program ended in January 2025 with the installation of 117 large cisterns, 65 rain gardens, and 124 rainwater irrigated street trees across residential properties. These systems can collectively capture up to 185,000 gallons of rainwater per storm, helping reduce erosion and ponding while improving creek baseflow. The program focused on a 1.08-square-mile area in North Central Austin, located in the upper portion of the Waller Creek Watershed. This urban neighborhood, with 46% impervious cover, was developed before Austin’s watershed protection regulations were in place and lacked space for large-scale green stormwater infrastructure. This program brought meaningful water quality and stormwater benefits to an area that lacked such protections during its original development.

“By working across City departments, partnering with a nonprofit and researchers, and engaging our community, we were able to turn rainwater from a problem into a resource to improve creek health, conserve water, cool our city, and build stronger neighborhoods along the way,” said Environmental Officer Liz Johnston. She added, “The actions that individuals take matter. Program participants now have a deeper understanding of their role in making Austin a more livable and resilient city.”

In addition to improving watershed health, the Rain Catcher Pilot Program contributed to water conservation, alternative water sources during outages, increased tree canopy, enhanced wildlife habitat, and stronger neighborhood connections. It also encouraged residents to view rainwater as a resource, not runoff. The program was administered by Austin Watershed Protection and developed in collaboration with Urban Patchwork and community partners. Austin Water and Austin Development Services provided support and additional funding to reduce the cost for residents adding a rain garden or cistern to their properties.

With the current shutdown of the U.S. government, key climate and environmental programs have been halted. The Environmental Protection Agency is the most severely affected, with nearly 90% of its staff being furloughed. This means regulatory work, research, and public updates have been paused indefinitely. Another affected agency is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). NFIP, which insures 4.7 million properties, cannot issue new policies or renewals, threatening real estate transactions and leaving homeowners vulnerable. Due to public safety needs, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will continue forecasting, but all nonessential research has been suspended. While no agencies have expressed plans for layoffs, President Trump has threatened mass firings.

This politicization of essential environmental services and threats of layoffs is damaging to regulatory stability, public trust, and long-term climate resilience in the United States and beyond. Stalling critical climate research and regulation could have serious repercussions in a time of increased climate risk.

Omnibus agreement fails in European Parliament ahead of mid-October vote

The intended last round of discussions for the sustainability Omnibus took place on Tuesday. After tense negotiations, members of the European Parliament failed to reach an agreement. The primary issues under discussion include liability under the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), corporate regulations, and climate transition plans. Jörgen Warborn, Swedish member of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and lead negotiator, presented two packages. The first would raise the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and eliminate obligatory climate transition plans. This package has received the backing of the far-right. In the second package, the scope of CSRD would remain for companies with 1,000 employees, but compulsory implementation of CSDDD transition plans would be discarded. Warborn said that his goal “has always been to simplify and cut cost for businesses.” The vote is set to take place on Tuesday, 13 October, provided that Parliament’s position is filed by 8 October.

Renewable energy surplus attracts cryptocurrency miners to Brazil

With the country’s surplus in renewable power, cryptocurrency mining companies are looking to Brazil to begin mining projects. For a crypto transaction to be processed, complex mathematical problems must be solved on mining machines that have been known to overload grids worldwide. With minimal crypto mining and a surplus of energy, Brazil is an ideal location for crypto miners to focus their efforts. Cryptocurrency companies like Tether and Enegix are negotiating deals with Renova Energia and other Brazilian energy companies. Renova informed Reuters that it is launching a $200 million, 100 megawatt (MW) wind-powered mining operation in the northeast of Brazil. Despite these opportunities, challenges remain, including water scarcity, regulatory gaps, and inadequate infrastructure. Companies that wish to make smart and sustainable investment decisions should consider ESG solutions for guidance.

European Union to raise tariffs and cut quotas on steel

According to industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, the EU plans to decrease foreign steel import quotas by nearly 50% and significantly raise tariffs. These measures aim to protect the struggling steel industry by countering subsidized steel from Asia and North Africa. The U.S. and Canada have also begun similar measures, charging 50% tariffs on imported steel. The steel industry has requested 50% tariffs on any imports above the proposed quotas. The European Parliament and EU Member States must approve the plan. Séjourné urged industry workers and unions to back the proposal as he expects opposition from minority interests. Corporations can use ESG solutions to navigate the ever-changing landscape of regulations.

“It would affect not only the communities around the data centers but the workers and other communities that are making the components for the data centers,” Doa said.
Data centers also consume high levels of energy, water—and chemicals.
Data centers and supporting industries regularly use PFAS gases, or f-gases as refrigerants used to cool electronics.
The EPA said in its release that the program is intended to “reduce the backlog” of new chemicals, but data centers are being built and are operating without these compounds.","The Trump administration has begun prioritizing the review of new, potentially hazardous chemicals used in data centers that public health advocates and environmental attorneys warn could endanger workers, communities and the environment.

While the Environmental Protection Agency, which made the announcement last month, has prioritized new chemical reviews for some industries in the past, advocates said the new EPA effort and an accompanying executive order, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure,” signed by President Trump go well beyond data centers and benefit the fossil fuel, nuclear and semiconductor industries, among others.

They include what advocates said is unprecedented language that calls for the EPA to “ease” and “reduce” regulations.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration, which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the fast-track chemical review. “The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works.”

The EPA’s language is “hugely broad” and “shocking,” said Maria Doa, chemical policy director with the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

“I don’t think we’ve seen this blatant language before,” Doa said. “The EPA said it is going to ‘Get out of the way,’ not ‘The EPA is going to do a thorough but expedited review.’”

That could have wide-reaching consequences. “It would affect not only the communities around the data centers but the workers and other communities that are making the components for the data centers,” Doa said.

Big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon need data centers—typically warehouse-sized facilities filled with computer servers, data storage drives and other network equipment—to process the world’s digital traffic and meet the extraordinary computational demands of the artificial intelligence boom, which is driving demand for more facilities.

Data centers also consume high levels of energy, water—and chemicals. Public health advocates are only now beginning to understand that data centers are a source of chemical pollution, especially from PFAS, so-called “forever chemicals,” which are used to cool some facilities. PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 16,000 chemicals, and many are linked to cancer and a range of serious health risks.

Data centers and supporting industries regularly use PFAS gases, or f-gases as refrigerants used to cool electronics. Though f-gases are generally less toxic than some other PFAS, there is very little health and safety information for most, and that which does exist still points to concerning toxicity. Some f-gases are also potent greenhouse gases.

In a statement sent to Inside Climate News, the EPA defended the program. “Nothing in EPA’s announcement suggests that the agency intends to use this effort to circumvent the law,” a spokesperson wrote. “This is a ridiculous claim made by special interest groups in an attempt to distract from the work the Trump administration is doing to make our work more efficient and make our country the AI capital of the world.”

The EPA’s move to prioritize approval of new chemicals used in data centers comes as local communities mobilize to thwart proposed data center projects. Across Michigan, advocates are working to derail, or have derailed, plans for at least seven centers. Residents fear impact on their utility bills, climate impacts, changes to their communities’ rural characters and pollution from diesel generators. The chemical pollution, often through wastewater discharges, adds a new layer.

Meanwhile, Michigan has identified over 300 sites contaminated with PFAS and is struggling to address those and rein in pollution in its surface and groundwater.

“We’re adding new sources of potential contamination before we even have a grasp on the extent of the impact of how the PFAS already here are impacting the environment and our bodies,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra Club Michigan’s legislative director. “If the EPA is going to be speeding up these reviews for new chemicals, some fluorinated without any sort of safeguard, then the risk is going to land on residents.”

“Incredibly Dangerous”

Newly developed chemicals that industry wants to use are subjected to environmental and health reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and the EPA often imposes restrictions on those that create an “unreasonable risk.” The process can take months, and new chemical reviews occur in “blackbox,” advocates say.

In announcing its expedited chemical review for data centers, the EPA said that it facilitated Trump’s vision of AI at the heart of a “hypercompetitive global race” and was “focused on strengthening America’s energy foundation and ensuring our nation remains the global leader in AI and the infrastructure that powers it.”

Trump’s executive order covers broad swaths of multiple industries, and could include chemicals used for transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, substations, switchyards, transformers, natural gas turbines, coal power equipment, nuclear power equipment, geothermal power equipment and electrical infrastructure. The order also covers the semiconductor industry, which has been found to pollute air and water with PFAS.

The wording in the executive order and EPA announcement is so broad that it may include suppliers further upstream, and the program’s limits are unclear, advocates said.

“This is really telling industry, ‘Just contrive of any connection between your substance and the vast scope of this program, and you can get prioritized review,’ and I think that is incredibly dangerous,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, an attorney with Earthjustice, which has litigated on EPA new chemical programs.

The EPA said in its release that the program is intended to “reduce the backlog” of new chemicals, but data centers are being built and are operating without these compounds. “There is no demonstrated need for this prioritization,” said Dan Rosenberg, an attorney who litigates on toxic chemical laws for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He noted that the program also comes after the 2016 congressional approval of an update to the Toxic Substances Control Act, which aimed to strengthen the new chemical review process. The Senate unanimously approved the update.

The Trump administration’s actions do the opposite, Rosenberg said, and it is proceeding “as if this broad rhetoric about regulatory relief can somehow override congressional mandates to review chemical safety to protect the public—that’s not how it works.”

“That’s how we got a PFAS crisis in the first place—PFAS zipping through the new chemical program without adequate review or restrictions,” Rosenberg said.

“It Isn’t Just About Fast Tracking”

How the EPA reviews new data center chemicals remains to be seen, advocates said, but the agency has a spotty record when it expedites the process.

During the first Trump administration, the agency permitted industry to utilize a PFAS exemption that allowed the chemicals to be sent to market with little scrutiny in under 30 days, including compounds that were “lethal if inhaled” and “corrosive to the skin.”

When the EPA announced last year that it would fast-track the approval of semiconductor PFAS, it claimed to have put in place a “framework” to ensure the chemicals are safe, but did not provide details. The agency generally uses standardized formulas to assess health and environmental risks that watchdog groups have said are not fully protective, and it relies on industry health and safety data to make decisions.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA announced it would “streamline” biofuel chemical reviews, which the agency touted as a climate solution, even though it included highly toxic chemicals that would be produced by burning plastic waste. The order also covered mixed metal oxides used in batteries, but the scope and thoroughness of the review were “opaque,” Klamuss-Katz said.

The EPA found many of the chemicals created what Kalmuss-Katz characterized as “astronomical risks” to workers and the surrounding neighborhoods near the Louisiana plant that would produce the compounds. Kalmuss-Katz and Earthjustice challenged the approval in court, and EPA announced it would withdraw the chemicals’ approval, though Chevron is still seeking permission to use them.

But the new Trump order is worse because it goes further in scope, Kalmuss-Katz said, and “it isn’t just about fast tracking.”

“The EPA is also making clear it wants to lessen regulations and remove barriers for the chemicals going to market, and when you’re talking about PFAS and other compounds that can cause serious harm—that regulation is what keeps people safe,” Kalmuss-Katz said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226519839-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:42.341350

The Energy Department said on Wednesday night that it would cancel more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for hundreds of energy projects, with the vast majority located in states led by Democrats. The move underscored how the Trump administration appeared to be using the government shutdown as a pretext to punish its political opponents.

The White House canceled about $26 billion in previously approved funds for climate and transportation projects, mostly in blue states.

E.P.A. employees left in limbo during the shutdown

On Wednesday, Day 1 of the government shutdown, I wrote about the widespread confusion at the Environmental Protection Agency, where Trump administration officials said they would follow a plan calling for a skeleton crew of agency employees, but then ordered nearly everyone to continue work.

It’s now Day 2 of the shutdown and there’s still little clarity around what funding the agency responsible for protecting America’s air and water is using to keep employees on the job, or how long it will last. Some federal agencies do have balances of appropriated funds that carry over from the previous funding period, but the Trump administration hasn’t confirmed how E.PA. operations are being funded.

One thing that is clear: The longer the shutdown lasts, the more activities will grind to a halt.

When the E.P.A.’s shutdown plan does go into effect, major elements of the agency’s work will cease, including civil enforcement inspections, the on-site visits to chemical facilities and other plants that ensure compliance with environmental regulations. So would the issuance of new contracts and permits.

Cleanup at hazardous waste areas known as Superfund sites would be decided on a case-by-case basis, but would generally only continue in areas where stopping would pose an imminent threat to human life.

Something that could take a serious hit is E.P.A. Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plan to repeal dozens of air, water and climate regulations. Before they are finalized, many of those rollbacks require months of analysis of their economic and health effects. If workers are furloughed, that would be put on hold.

In the meantime, employees at E.P.A. report being in a state of limbo.

Under a plan the Trump administration issued this week, the E.P.A. said it would place about 90 percent of its staff on furlough in the event of a shutdown. But late on Tuesday, hours before the government ran out of money, at least some agency employees received an email saying they “work on activities which currently have funds available” and should report to work as usual.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom's office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancellation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/09/PDTN/78372753007-ap-25038082523588.jpg?crop=5777,3247,x5,y113&width=3200&height=1799&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-02 16:01:54.751481

Stacey Knoll thought the court summons she received was a scam. She didn’t remember getting any medical bills from Montrose Regional Health, a nonprofit hospital, after a 2020 emergency room visit.

So she was shocked when, three years after the trip to the hospital, her employer received court orders requiring it to start funneling a chunk of her paychecks to a debt collector for an unpaid $881 medical bill — which had grown to $1,155.26 from interest and court fees.

The timing was terrible. After leaving a bad marriage and staying in a shelter, she had just gotten full custody of her three children, steady housing in Montrose, Colorado, and a job at a gas station.

“And that’s when I got that garnishment from the court,” she said. “It was really scary. I’d never been on my own or raised kids on my own.”

KFF Health News reviewed 1,200 Colorado cases in which judges, over a two-year period from Feb. 1, 2022, through Feb. 1, 2024, gave permission to garnish wages over unpaid bills. At least 30% of the cases stemmed from medical care — even when patients’ bills should have been covered by Medicaid, the public insurance program for those with low incomes or disabilities. That 30% is likely an underestimate since medical debt is often hidden behind other types of debt, such as from credit cards or payday loans. But even that minimum would translate to roughly 14,000 cases a year in Colorado in which courts approved taking people’s wages because of unpaid medical bills.

Among the other findings:

Patients were pursued for medical bills ranging from under $30 to over $30,000, with most of the bills amounting to less than $2,400. As the cases rolled through the legal system, accumulating interest and court fees, the amount that patients owed often grew by 25%. In one case, it snowballed by more than 400%.

Cases trailed people for up to 14 years after they received medical care, with debt collectors reviving their cases even as they moved from job to job.

Medical providers of all stripes are behind these bills — big health care chains, small rural hospitals, physician groups, public ambulance services, and more. In several cases, hospitals won permission to take the pay of their own employees who had unpaid bills from treatment at the facilities.

Colorado has company. It is one of 45 states that allow wage garnishment for unpaid medical bills. Only Delaware, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas have banned wage garnishment for medical debt.

As KFF Health News has reported, medical debt is devastating for millions of people across the country. And now the problem is likely to grow more pressing nationwide. Millions of Americans are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years due to Medicaid changes in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law and if Congress allows some Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire. That means health crises for the newly uninsured could lead them, too, into a spiral of medical debt.

And the hurt will linger: Large unpaid medical bills are staying on credit reports in most states after a July decision from a federal judge reversed a new rule aimed at protecting consumers.

“If you can't maintain your health, how are you going to work to pay back a debt?” said Adam Fox, deputy director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, a nonprofit aimed at lowering health costs. “And if you fundamentally can't pay the bill, wage garnishment isn't going to help you do that. It's going to put you in more financial distress.”

Flying Blind on Medical Debt

When someone fails to pay a bill, the creditor that provided the service — whether for a garage door repair, a car loan, or medical care — can take the debtor to court. Creditors can also pass the debt to a debt collector or debt buyer, who can do the same.

“At any given point, about 1% of working adults are being garnished for some reason,” said Anthony DeFusco, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who studied paycheck data from ADP, a payroll processor that distributes paychecks to about a fifth of private sector U.S. workers. “That's a big chunk of the population.”

But specific research into the practice of garnishing wages over medical debt is scant. Studies in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York have found that nonprofit hospitals commonly garnish wages from indebted patients, with some studies finding those patients tend to work in low-wage occupations.

Marty Makary, who led research on medical debt wage garnishment in Virginia at Johns Hopkins University before joining Trump’s cabinet as Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has called the practice “aggressive.” He co-authored a study that found 36% of Virginia hospitals, mostly nonprofit and mostly in urban areas, were using garnishment to collect unpaid debts in 2017, affecting thousands of patients.

The Colorado findings from KFF Health News show that hospitals are far from the only medical providers going after patients’ paychecks, though.

Researchers and advocates say that, in addition to a dearth of court case data, another phenomenon tends to obscure how often this happens. “People find debt shameful,” said Lester Bird, a senior manager at the Pew Charitable Trusts who specializes in courts. “A lot of this exists in the shadows.”

Without data on how often this tactic is employed, lawmakers are flying blind — even as a 2024 Associated Press-NORC poll showed about 4 in 5 U.S. adults believe it’s important for the federal government to provide medical debt relief.

‘Blood From a Turnip’

Colorado was among the first of 15 states to scratch medical debt from credit reports. Debt buyers in the state aren’t allowed to foreclose on a patient’s home. If qualified patients opt to pay in monthly installments, those payments shouldn’t exceed 6% of their household income — and the remaining debt gets wiped after about three years of paying.

But if they don’t agree to a payment plan, Coloradans can have up to 20% of their disposable earnings garnished. The National Consumer Law Center gave the state a “D” grade for state protections of family finances.

Consumer advocates said they aren’t sure how well even those Colorado requirements are being followed. And people wrote letters to the courts saying wage garnishment would exacerbate their already dire financial situations.

“I have begun to fall behind on my electricity, my gas, my water my credit cards,” wrote a man in western Colorado in a letter to a judge that KFF Health News obtained in the court filings. Court records show he was working in construction and at a rent-to-own store, with about $8,000 in medical debt. He wrote to the judge that he was paying close to $1,000 a month. “The way things are going now I will lose everything.”

The people being sued in KFF Health News’ Colorado review worked in a wide array of jobs. They worked in school districts, ranching, mining, construction, local government, even health care. Several worked at stores such as Walmart and Family Dollar, or at gas stations, restaurants, or grocery stores.

“You're really kicking people when they're down,” said Lois Lupica, a former attorney working with the Denver-based Community Economic Defense Project and the Debt Collection Lab at Princeton. “They're basically suing the you-can't-get-blood-from-a-turnip population.”

In 2022, court records show, Valley View health system based in Glenwood Springs was allowed to garnish the wages of one of its patients over a $400 medical bill. The patient was working at a local organization that the health system supported as part of the community benefits it provides to keep its tax-exempt status. Nonprofit hospitals like Valley View are required to provide community benefits, which can also include charity care that covers patients’ bills.

Stacey Gavrell, the health system’s chief community relations officer, said it offers options such as interest-free payment plans and care at reduced or no cost to families with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level.

“As our rural region’s largest healthcare provider, it is imperative to the health and well-being of our community that Valley View remains a financially viable organization,” she said. “Most of our patients work with us to develop a payment plan or pursue financial assistance.”

The collection agency that took the employee to court, A-1 Collection Agency, advertises itself on its website as empathetic: “We understand times are tough and money is tight.”

Pilar Mank, who oversees operations at A-1’s parent company, Healthcare Management, said it accepts payment plans as small as $50 a month and that most of the hospitals it works with allow it to offer a discount if patients pay all at once.

“Suing a patient is the absolute last resort,” she said. “We try everything we can to work with the patient.”

If you can't maintain your health, how are you going to work to pay back a debt?

Adam Fox, deputy director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative

Hospitals sometimes also garnish wages from their own employees for care they provided them. In one case, a hospital employee worked her way up from housekeeper to registrar to quality analyst. She even participated in public events representing her employer and appeared on the hospital’s website as a featured employee — while the court issued writs of garnishment until her $10,000 in medical bills from the hospital was paid off.

“Hospital care costs money to deliver,” said Colorado Hospital Association spokesperson Julie Lonborg about hospitals’ garnishing their own employees’ wages. “In some ways, I think it's funny to be asked the question. I would understand if someone said, ‘Why aren't you garnishing their wages?’”

Studies show that hospital debt collection efforts through wage garnishment bring in only about 0.2% of hospital revenues, said April Kuehnhoff, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, which advocates for people with low incomes.

""We also know that there are states that don't allow this at all,” she said. “Hospitals are continuing to provide medical care to consumers.”

Smooth Sailing for Collectors — But Not for Patients

Health care providers appeared as the plaintiffs in only 2% of the medical debt cases. Instead, cases were filed almost entirely by third-party debt collectors and buyers, with BC Services and Professional Finance Company behind more than half of the cases, followed by A-1 Collection Agency and Wakefield & Associates.

Debt buyers make money by buying debt from providers who’ve given up on getting paid then collecting what they can of the money owed, plus interest. Debt collectors get paid a percentage of what they recover. Some companies do a bit of both.

BC Services declined to comment, and Wakefield & Associates did not respond to questions.

Charlie Shoop, president of Professional Finance Company, said his company initiates wage garnishment on less than 1% of all accounts placed with it for collection.

Health care providers in Colorado can no longer hide behind debt collectors’ names when they sue people, according to a 2024 state law prompted by a 9News-Colorado Sun investigation in partnership with a Colorado News Collaborative-KFF Health News reporting project.

In many states, the path for filing a case against a debtor and garnishing their wages is relatively smooth — especially if the debtor doesn’t appear in court.

“It's unbelievably easy,” said Dan Vedra, a lawyer in Colorado who often represents consumers in debt cases. “If you have a word processor and a spreadsheet, you can mass-produce thousands of lawsuits in a matter of hours or minutes.”

Within KFF Health News’ sample, nearly all the medical debt cases were default judgments, meaning the patient did not defend themselves in court or in writing. Missing a court date can happen for a variety of reasons, such as not receiving the notice in the mail, assuming it was a scam, knowingly ignoring it, or not having the time to take off from work.

Vedra and other debt law experts said a high rate of default judgments indicates a system that favors the pursuers over the pursued — and increases the chances someone will be harmed by an erroneous bill.

But in New Hampshire, creditors now have to keep going to court for each paycheck they want to garnish, because the state allows creditors to garnish only wages that have already been earned, said Maanasa Kona, an associate research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

“It might not look like much on paper,” she said. “It's just not worth it if they have to keep going back to court.”

If you have a word processor and a spreadsheet, you can mass-produce thousands of lawsuits in a matter of hours or minutes.

Wrongly Pursued for Bills

The nation’s medical billing setup is already prone to errors due to its complexity, according to Barak Richman, a law professor at George Washington University and a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine who has studied medical debt collection practices in several states. “Bills are not only noncomprehensible, but often wrong,” Richman said.

Indeed, Colorado’s Health Care Policy & Financing Department, which runs Medicaid in the state, said it sent out nearly 11,000 letters in the past fiscal year to health providers and collectors that erroneously went after patients on Medicaid. Bills for Medicaid recipients are supposed to be sent to Medicaid, not the patients, who typically pay a nominal amount, if anything, for their care.

Shoop said his industry has pushed Colorado, without success, for access to a database that would allow them to confirm if patients had Medicaid coverage.

Colorado’s Medicaid program declined to comment.

Patricia DeHerrera in Rifle, Colorado, had to prove that she and her children had Medicaid when they received care at Grand River Health — but only after A-1 contacted her employer at the time, the gas station chain Kum & Go, with court-approved paperwork to take a portion of her paychecks.

She contacted the state, which sent letters to the hospital and the collector notifying them they were engaging in “illegal billing action” and telling the collector to stop. The companies did.

Theresa Wagenman, controller for Grand River Health, said if a patient can present a letter from a Medicaid caseworker saying they’re eligible, then their bills get removed from the collections pipeline. Wagenman also said patients get at least eight letters in the mail and several phone calls before Grand River gives the go-ahead for the collector to send them to court.

DeHerrera’s main advice to others in this situation: “Know your rights. Otherwise, they’re going to take advantage of you.”

Yet fighting back isn’t easy.

Nicole Silva, who lives in the 900-person town of Sanford in south-central Colorado, said she and her family were all on Medicaid when her daughter was in a car crash. Still, court records show, her wages were garnished for a $2,181.60 ambulance ride, which grew to more than $3,000 from court fees and interest.

She tried to prove the bill was wrong, contacting her county’s social services office, but Silva said it wasn’t helpful and she wasn’t able to reach the right person at a state office. The state Medicaid program confirmed to KFF Health News that her daughter was covered at the time of the wreck.

Fighting the bill felt like too much for Silva and her husband to handle while parenting a growing number of kids, one of them severely disabled, and working — she as a preschool teacher and he as a rancher.

Not receiving the roughly $500 a month that she said came out of her pay was enough to affect their ability to pay other bills. “It was deciding to buy groceries or pay the electric bill,” Silva said.

When their electricity got shut off, she said, they had to scramble to borrow money from colleagues and friends to get it turned back on — with an extra fee.

She said the saga makes her hesitant to call an ambulance in the future.

Fox, of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, said consumers often think they cannot do anything to stop their wages from being garnished, but they can contest it in court, for example by pointing out they should have qualified for discounted — or charity — care if the hospital that provided the treatment is a nonprofit.

DeFusco, the economist, believes filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is an underused option for debtors. It halts garnishment in its tracks, though not always permanently, and it comes with other consequences. But he understands it’s a Catch-22: It’s a complex process and typically necessitates hiring a lawyer.

“To get rid of your debt, you need money,” he said. “And the whole reason you're in this situation is because you don't have money.”

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/10/2025-01-14T110137Z_1948183175_RC2WTAAPBM30_RTRMADP_3_BERKSHIRE-COAL-POLLUTION-1024x722.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:46.715867

On Oct. 2, the Austin, Texas-based company announced it delivered more than 497,000 vehicles in the 90-day period that ended on Sept. 30. The company said that was a record amount of sales for a quarter. Most deliveries were of the company’s Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers, which together accounted for 481,166 units in the quarter.

The amount of sales was also well ahead of the about 470,000 vehicles the company delivered in the same quarter of the prior year. The sales total was considered to be ahead of Wall Street’s expectations for the third quarter of 2025.

Tesla’s strong performance was in line with industry trends showing exceptionally strong demand for electric vehicles before the program ended. On Sept. 16, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, wrote that total electric vehicle sales in the United States hit a record in August 2025.

Ford, a competitor in the electric vehicle space, reported a similar boost in electric vehicle sales. In a third-quarter sales report it published on Oct. 1, the Dearborn, Michigan, based automaker said its overall electric vehicle sales were up by 19.8 percent in the 90-day period. In a release it called that performance its “best third quarter ever” for electric vehicle sales.

Even with the strong sales performance, investors sent Tesla’s stock price downward on Thursday. As of about midday Eastern time, the price of Tesla’s stock had fallen by about 3 percent to about $446 a share from its opening price of $470.54 a share.

In its Oct. 2 release, Tesla said it is scheduled to release its full third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 22. When it last reported on July 23, it said it was profitable through the first six months of 2025. However, its total net income—or profit—had fallen to about $1.58 billion from about $2.79 billion in the past year.

The NC Chamber notes the plan “projects that future bill impacts will remain below inflation while adding nuclear, natural gas, solar, and storage resources to expand capacity.
These priorities closely align with the NC Chamber Foundation’s Business-Driven Energy Vision, which highlights predictable costs, grid resiliency, and an all-of-the-above energy mix as foundations for economic growth.” Duke’s plan comes amid soaring demand for power.
Much of the environmentalists’ criticism about Duke’s plan involved the proposal to extend the life of its coal-fired plants until 2040, while showing a reduced emphasis on solar energy.
It noted that low energy prices compared with national averages is helping North Carolina attract new employers and investment at a record pace.","Environmental advocates in North Carolina slammed Duke Energy’s long-term vision for power generation, as disclosed this week in a regulatory filing. But the state’s main business-promotion organization praised the report.

The Charlotte-based utility’s biennial “Carolinas Resource Plan” provides insight into how it expects to provide electricity for its nearly 4 million N.C. customers over the next decade. The N.C. Utilities Commission will receive comments on the required plan from a variety of groups over the next three months, then make a ruling late next year.

The NC Chamber notes the plan “projects that future bill impacts will remain below inflation while adding nuclear, natural gas, solar, and storage resources to expand capacity. These priorities closely align with the NC Chamber Foundation’s Business-Driven Energy Vision, which highlights predictable costs, grid resiliency, and an all-of-the-above energy mix as foundations for economic growth.”

Duke’s plan comes amid soaring demand for power. The company expects growth over the next 15 years that is eight times greater than the past 15, mainly because of datacenters needed for artificial intelligence computing.

Much of the environmentalists’ criticism about Duke’s plan involved the proposal to extend the life of its coal-fired plants until 2040, while showing a reduced emphasis on solar energy.

“Duke proposes to greatly increase methane gas for power and experimental nuclear plants while extending its burning of coal for at least 15 years,” according to longtime company critic Jim Warren, executive director of the NC WARN nonprofit in Durham. “The plan slashes projections for large-scale solar and continues its suppression of rooftop solar. This would put billions into the rate system, leading power bills to double or triple over time while driving even more weather disasters that are devastating North Carolina communities.”

At the Southern Environmental Law Center, attorney David Neal said Duke’s plan is too reliant on “expensive new gas power plants, leaving North Carolina families on the hook for escalating fuel costs and making it harder to reach the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement. Duke yet again appears to have fallen short of taking full advantage of energy efficiency, load flexibility, renewables, and storage, which remain the cheapest and fastest suite of options for meeting rising demand.”

The Environmental Defense Fund, the largest U.S. environmental group with more than 3 million members, noted that Duke’s plan “reaffirms that large amounts of solar and battery storage remain the cheapest choice to meet growing demand, even without a short-term battery reduction requirement.”

Continued declines in battery prices could displace Duke’s plans for more natural gas-fired power plants, Will Scott, EDF’s Southeast climate and clean energy director, said in a release.

Duke contends that its proposed generation mix, which calls for additional capacity from nuclear energy starting in 2037 and the addition of several new gas plants, provides the best balance for reliability and affordability. It noted that low energy prices compared with national averages is helping North Carolina attract new employers and investment at a record pace.

Duke’s plan comes as the GOP-led Congress, N.C. General Assembly and the Trump Administration have struck down subsidies that helped make solar and wind power the main source of additional U.S. power generation over the past decade.

Duke is the fourth-largest U.S. electric utility based on market capitalization of $94 billion. Its shares have gained about 66% over the past five years, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 116% gain in the S&P 500 Index.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/BusinessNC_2021_logo_orange.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:02:34.604023

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom’s office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

A rush to take advantage of a US$7,500 tax credit for EV purchases delivered a temporary boost to Tesla’s core automotive business, which languished for several quarters under the weight of an aging lineup and rising competition. The company also faced a consumer backlash to chief executive Elon Musk’s politics as he worked closely with President Donald Trump early this year.

Article content

Investors recently looked past Tesla’s first-half sales weakness to Musk’s promises of growth in areas such as driverless vehicles, artificial intelligence and robotics. The carmaker’s shares soared 33 per cent in September, recouping early-year losses and adding US$401.9 billion of market value.

The stock gave back some of those gains Thursday, falling as much as 3.2 per cent as of noon New York time.

“While the numbers were better than expected, we think it is important to highlight the data is backward-looking,” said Garrett Nelson, an equity analyst at CFRA Research. “Looking ahead, we think there are still major questions regarding the earnings impact of legislative changes on the tradeable emissions credit market and EV demand in an unsubsidized U.S. market.”

The phase-out of EV tax credits in the U.S. after Sept. 30 helped drive widespread demand for electric models from the likes of General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. last quarter. Rivian Automotive Inc. also reported better-than-expected vehicle deliveries, though the EV maker narrowed its annual guidance toward the lower end of its prior range.

But questions remain over how development along the Congaree River will balance with environmental protection.
Advocates say the projects could define how Columbia showcases its riverfront for decades to come.
“It’s downtown, and it’s going to be how Columbia really identifies its riverfront moving forward.
Being engaged in that river protection effort is absolutely critical.”","Columbia leaders are preparing to reimagine one of the city’s most visible stretches of downtown riverfront.

But questions remain over how development along the Congaree River will balance with environmental protection.

The city plans to build a new public park alongside the area’s first private development on land between the Gervais and Blossom Street bridges. Advocates say the projects could define how Columbia showcases its riverfront for decades to come.

“This is a very visible stretch of river,” said Bill Stangler, the Congaree Riverkeeper. “It’s downtown, and it’s going to be how Columbia really identifies its riverfront moving forward. So how that gets done is certainly going to be important.”

The city is expected to select a design firm for the park in the coming months. Mayor Daniel Rickenmann has called the project “transformative,” saying it will help Columbia “finally unveil our river” and expand public access beyond canoeing and kayaking.

But with development comes oversight. The South Carolina Department of Environmental Services issues stormwater permits and other reviews to builders to limit pollution from construction. It also will inspect projects for compliance with state and federal protection regulations.

“The most common permits required from our agency for development projects are stormwater permits that limit the stormwater that comes from a construction site and could potentially impact the environment,” said Laura Renwick, the agency’s communications director. “Once a permit is issued, our agency performs inspections to make sure the industry or construction project is meeting the conditions of its permit.”

Renwick said the state also monitors for emerging contaminants such as PFAS, ethylene oxide and harmful algal blooms.

Stangler said those regulatory safeguards are essential. But he urged city leaders to go further by strengthening protections for surrounding properties – riparian buffers, wetlands and floodplains.

“We just need to make sure that the rules we have in place are strong enough to do what our communities want to see happen with these places,” he said. “There are opportunities to improve wetland and floodplain protection to make sure we’re putting the right things in the right places.”

The South Carolina Office of Resilience is also involved. The agency coordinates disaster recovery and preparedness across state government and with local partners. The office will advise developers and municipal officials on how to account for long-term risks such as heavier rainfall, land-use change and flash flooding.

“Development that preserves or enhances the natural function of the flood plain and accounts for future conditions can positively impact the community and economy while protecting the ecosystem functions,” said Kevin O’Dell, public information coordinator with the office.

Sustainable planning for Stangler is about more than rules and permits — it depends on public engagement. He said community advocacy for Columbia’s rivers has grown more vocal in recent years, helping to elevate them as a key part of the city’s identity.

“These rivers belong to each and every one of us,” Stangler said. “But it really matters when people stand up and speak up. Being engaged in that river protection effort is absolutely critical.”",https://carolinanewsandreporter.cic.sc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CNlogo2017-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:41.184478

It is only recently that research on climate change and politicians has started to become a focus of peer-reviewed literature10.
The limited research that exists on parliamentarians’ climate knowledge mostly examines knowledge of climate change’s human causes.
On the case, the UK has historically been an international leader on climate change mitigation.
For anthropogenic climate change belief and climate worry, we use the questions as fielded in the European Social Survey42.","The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports are a mammoth task, involving 782 authors, 66,000 peer-reviewed articles and almost 200,000 review comments1. They aim to provide an authoritative, objective source of information for policymakers on climate change’s causes and effects, as well as to outline pathways for mitigation and adaptation2. Their work has been described as “the world’s most influential climate report”3 and “the equivalent of the King James Bible on climate change”4.

As actors with the capacity to affect meaningful change within their countries and beyond, governments, parliamentarians and other policymakers are the primary targets of dissemination4. National governments are intertwined into the process itself to assist in their buy-in. Each government has to grant line-by-line approval to the summary for policymakers until it is agreed by consensus, and they agree to accept the reports as definitive5.

And yet, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which key messages from their summary reports are comprehended by parliamentarians. This is important given that the reports have been criticised for being overly complex for policymakers or the public to digest6, including by policymakers themselves4. Academics have also sought to raise attention that IPCC reports “treat politicians as a recipient of research findings, not an important object of detailed study”7. And yet the wider literature largely does not generally measure politicians’ climate change attitudes, including their knowledge of IPCC reports8. Understanding whether politicians have knowledge of key findings in IPCC reports is vital given that—despite the political consensus that the reports have—governments regularly follow differing if not contradictory policies to those that would be consistent with the reports’ findings9.

It is only recently that research on climate change and politicians has started to become a focus of peer-reviewed literature10. Getting access to politicians is difficult, especially sitting parliamentarians who have strong pressures on their time11, and thus the lack of research is understandable. However, the lack of awareness of politicians’ knowledge of the state of climate science is problematic. For although knowledge does not automatically result in policy action as people may not respond to scientific evidence in a linear way12,13,14,15, it is an important precursor to taking informed judgments. Empirical evidence demonstrates that knowledge can make a difference to politicians’ decisions on climate change16 as well as other policy areas17.

The limited research that exists on parliamentarians’ climate knowledge mostly examines knowledge of climate change’s human causes. In anglophone countries, this reveals considerable partisan divides18,19,20,21,22. Elsewhere, in a 2010 survey of Peruvian legislators, overall knowledge of ten statements based on the IPCC’s 2007 report (AR4) was poor23. While important contributions, from such literature we do not know whether parliamentarians internalise how urgent it is to implement deep and rapid decarbonisation. As one study examining knowledge of local politicians in Sweden (among other groups) has demonstrated, knowledge of climate change’s causes may be greater than that of its current state and future consequences24. Some richer information from MPs has been obtained through interviews25,26,27, but these are not designed to be representative.

Here, we address this gap by examining United Kingdom (UK) Members of Parliament’s (MPs’) knowledge of a key finding of the IPCC’s 6th assessment report: that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2025 if global average temperature increases are to be kept to 1.5 °C. The question was also asked to a representative sample of the British public. Both surveys were fielded in late 2023. The case and issue selection have particular theoretical and normative value.

On the case, the UK has historically been an international leader on climate change mitigation. Its landmark 2008 Climate Change Act served as the blueprint for many other countries. The UK Parliament was also the first national parliament to declare an environmental and climate emergency in 2019 and it co-hosted the 2021 Glasgow Conference of the Parties28. While not negating the political divides that exist on climate policies that have become more prominent in recent years29,30, it is thus a most likely country for parliamentarians to be aware of the key findings from IPCC reports. If they are not, then that suggests that the dissemination of the messages into other parliaments may also be a problem. For comparative purposes, we draw on public surveys undertaken in Canada, Chile and Germany to examine the individual-level drivers of public responses given to the knowledge question.

On the choice of topic, the “global emissions must peak by 2025 to retain a realistic chance for 1.5 degrees” statement was a key communication of the IPCC report directed at publics and policymakers. As such, it received headline attention in Britain and internationally from across the news spectrum, including the Economist31, Daily Mail32, Guardian33, Euronews34 and the BBC35. Thus, MPs—and publics who pay attention to current affairs—should have been exposed to the finding even in the absence of reading the report. From the perspective of the report lead authors, it was something they emphasised as a key takeaway in media interviews. One lead author referred to the finding as “a bit of a bombshell”36 while another told the BBC News35 that:

“I think the report tells us that we’ve reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5 °C. We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that, reduce them very rapidly”.

On the United Nations news section, it was also something that one of the co-chairs of Working Group III was quoted on as a takeaway message37. Thus, it was both a visible message and one that those involved in the report considered important to highlight, with the BBC News38 indeed referring to it in a headline as a “key finding”.

Moreover, given the limited time period of action, the decisions of these MPs during their period of office (2019–2024) were important to aid in the collective worldwide effort to achieve the goal. The UK, like many other countries39, has committed in law to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Yet if MPs are not aware that urgent action needs to be taken much sooner, then that could be one potential explanatory factor for not meeting long-term climate mitigation commitments at the national level see ref. 40. Our results do demonstrate that knowledge of this particular finding of the IPCC’s to be extremely low, with just under 15% of both MPs and publics providing the correct answer of 2025, and over 30% of each stating 2040 or later.

Surveys of UK members of parliament

A representative sample of 100 members of the UK House of Commons were polled in September/October 2023 as well as 2002 members of the British public in November/December 2023 (see the “Methods” section for question wording and further details). They were each presented with a one-sentence summary of the IPCC, informed that a 2022 report had provided a timescale by which global greenhouse gases must peak to limit global heating to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, and asked to choose from a choice of options from “2025” to “2050” (in 5 yearly intervals) the timeframe they think this is.

Figure 1 compares top-level responses for both MPs and publics. The distribution is remarkably similar in both groups. Just under 15% gave the correct answer of 2025 with just over 30% opting for 2030. Around a third indicated that global emissions do not need to peak before 2040. The sizeable proportion that answer 2050 may suggest confusion in respondents’ minds with the country’s Net Zero by 2050 goal. Obviously, respondents might get the right answer simply by guessing, which in aggregate could exaggerate the true number of MPs choosing the correct answer. However, even if we take the 15% of MPs giving the correct answer as an optimistic estimate, this points to a widespread lack of knowledge among both parliamentarians and the British public on the urgency within which action is required, with the vast majority thinking that emissions can peak by the end of the subsequent parliamentary period or later.

Given previous findings that Labour MPs’ and voters’ belief in the anthropogenic causes of climate change are greater than those of Conservative MPs18 and voters41, might there be a similar knowledge gap on the window of action for 1.5 °C? To examine this, in Fig. 2, we breakdown the responses by Conservative and Labour party affiliation for MPs and reported vote at the 2019 General Election for the British public.

The results show differences between MPs and voters of the same party. 27% of Labour MPs got the answer correct in comparison to 20% of Labour voters, while Labour voters are similar to Labour MPs in thinking the correct answer is 2030 or 2050. There is no difference between Conservative MPs and Conservative voters in those who got the answer correct at just 8.5%. However, 21% of Conservative MPs and 26% of Conservative voters consider that it is the further timeframe of 2050—these are approximately 60 percent higher than the respective answers for Labour MPs and voters. Thus, party affiliation/support is clearly associated with beliefs on the window of opportunity available.

Surveys of publics in Britain, Canada, Chile and Germany

To assess whether this lack of knowledge is particular to Britain or more widespread, we also asked the question to publics in 3 other countries: Canada, Chile and Germany (See Fig. 3). The response distribution follows a broadly similar pattern in all countries as that observed in Britain, with those selecting the correct answer of 2025 falling to as low as 10% in Germany. Chileans have the highest percentage (37%) of responses selecting 2030, while Germans stand out for being evenly split between 2030 and 2035 as the modal answers. However, in all countries the correct answer “2025” is either the second or third least chosen response.

How do these patterns breakdown for different groups within each country? Given the large numbers of respondents, we can run ordinary least squares multivariate regression models to examine this. We code the dependent variable so that 1 (2050) represents the answer furthest from what the report found, and 6 (2025) represents the correct answer, i.e., higher values represent answers closer to the correct one. In this way, we can account for the degree of accuracy of respondents’ answers.

For explanatory variables, we include factors known to correlate with climate change beliefs and attitudes, beginning with sociodemographic predictors, that is age, gender, being university educated, living in an urban or rural area, and a measure of self-assessed social status41,42,43. To this, we add belief in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and worry about it, with greater levels of these having been found to relate to perceptions of the scientific consensus on climate change44,45. Moreover, general values, worldviews and political orientation may have substantial predictive power given previous research findings46. Therefore, we insert into our models left-right self-placement, a conspiracy belief mentality index, and a trust in scientists index. Given that we are examining knowledge of a report that was heavily publicised in the media, we additionally include self-reported political attention. All variables have been recoded to run from 0 to 1 (see the “Methods” section for further details).

The findings of the models are presented in Fig. 4. The one characteristic that is statistically significant in all countries is age, with younger individuals more likely to be closer to the correct answer. A further two variables are significantly correlated with being closer to the correct response in all countries except Chile: being more worried about climate change and having a lower conspiracy belief mentality. Unique to Chile in attaining statistical significance is residing in a more urban area. In Chile as well as Britain, those who trust scientists more are more likely to be closer to the correct answer. Controlling for all these factors, left-right self-placement only appears as statistically significant in Britain, where the more right-wing are more likely to be incorrect. Adding in vote at the previous election to the British model as discussed earlier in the paper (model not displayed), we see that this is driven by Conservative voters being further away and Green voters being closer on average to the correct answer than Labour voters.

In this paper, we investigated—firstly—whether MPs in the House of Commons and the British public were aware of a key and widely publicised finding from the IPCC’s 6th progress report: that global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2025 to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 °C. Our results demonstrated knowledge of this particular finding to be extremely low, with just under 15% of both MPs and publics providing the correct answer of 2025, and over 30% of each stating 2040 or later. Despite minimal aggregate differences between the MP and publics survey, a key divide was based on political party within MPs and publics, whereby Conservative MPs/voters were less likely to provide the correct answer than Labour MPs/voters. Secondly, we showed that these low levels of knowledge are not confined to publics in Britain but are also recorded by publics in the diverse countries of Canada, Chile and Germany. Greater accuracy among publics was generally predicted by being younger, being worried about climate change, and having lower levels of conspiracy belief mentality.

These results raise important implications for communicating findings from IPCC progress reports. Only a small percentage of MPs in the 2019–2024 House of Commons were aware of the report’s important finding that global emissions needed to peak during their period in office for the 1.5 °C target to be achievable. And yet, to act on information, individuals need to be aware of it. That the message is not getting through may be one barrier for the country being off track to meet their 2030 emissions reduction targets, which would require the imposition of more stringent climate mitigation measures as reported in the UK Climate Change Committee’s47 2024 report. The partisan divides in Britain—whereby MPs of the then ruling Conservative party were less likely to respond correctly than those of the then Labour opposition, and that these divides were mirrored among their voters—also suggest that whether information is perceived or not and, if so, how it is perceived, may differ according to political mindsets.

The UK is of course not the only country to be off track in meeting its 2030 emissions reduction targets. Taking into account the institutional constraints within countries, a 2024 study suggests that even under the most ambitious scenarios, there is only a 5–45% likelihood of staying below 1.6 °C at peak warming and that without a near-term increase in climate policy ambition that “an even higher overshoot will soon become inevitable”48. The other three countries in our publics surveys are all set to miss their 2030 emissions reduction targets as found in independent reports for Canada49, Chile50, and Germany51. Germany indeed is estimated to have the largest percentage gap within the European Union between its target and what it is set to achieve51. Our paper shows that knowledge of the degree of urgency required is low both within the political elite in the UK and in the public across four diverse countries. Politicians pay attention to the views of publics or constituents, whereby concern from below can motivate politicians into decarbonising action, and a lack of concern can act as a barrier10,52. Thus, the lack of awareness among members of the public of this key finding from the IPCC report—despite it being widely reported on—is of concern.

This present study has some limitations. While we focus on knowledge of an important policy-relevant finding, we cannot infer whether this low knowledge generalises to knowledge of other findings from the IPCC report. Furthermore, politicians and publics may be in possession of other knowledge and experiences that would propel them to undertake urgent action, and individuals may be aware of the IPCC’s findings without believing them or without these facts affecting their viewpoints. For while “scientific knowledge of climate change is clearly imperative for informed policy-making”53, the mechanism through which knowledge transfers to other facets of climate change beliefs, attitudes and policy support is not always straightforward15.

As we can identify the knowledge deficit among MPs but not ascertain the reason(s) for this in our study, we call for future research that can investigate such mechanisms through for instance in-depth qualitative interviews with national MPs across the globe on their consumption of IPCC findings and the perceived influence that these do (or do not) have on them. Being able to track MPs’ knowledge of a wider variety of findings from IPCC reports would also provide a more nuanced and complete understanding of what facts are landing with the IPCC’s core target audience and what is not.

To conclude, in a world of increasing information saturation and disinformation campaigns, getting factual information to permeate through political establishments and the public sphere is by no means an easy task. This is especially the case on a complex challenge like climate change for which certain powerful economic and political interests continue to widely spread misinformation on the facts of the issue54. But it is imperative in advance of the 7th progress report that the IPCC and the wider research community can further understand how to effectively get the key scientific messages across to policymakers and the broader public. As time for meaningful action is running out, achieving such a task is of an urgent nature.

Data collection

MP survey

MPs are a notoriously difficult group to contact given severe limits on their time11. One approach when carrying out MP surveys is for researchers to initiate contact with them and issue subsequent reminders to complete the survey; however, this typically leads to very low response rates or sample sizes by which it is not possible to make inferential claims on the wider population55.

To overcome this, our question was placed on an online Omnibus survey of MPs carried out by Savanta, which has a record of obtaining high-quality data with high response rates from MPs56,57,58. Savanta has been running its parliamentary panel for over 20 years. It runs its survey reaching 100 MPs multiple times a year while also engaging with parliamentarians outside fieldwork times to ensure regular participation. During fieldwork, Savanta monitors quotas and conducts quality control to ensure genuine completion from MPs. However, it is important to note that MPs on the “Government payroll”, i.e., Ministers, are not invited because by law these are not allowed to give any opinion that is not the Government policy. Ethics approval for this study—including the procedure for receiving informed consent from participants—was approved on 18th November 2022 by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Subcommittee at the University of East Anglia (Ethics number: ETH2223-0766).

The field dates were from 6 September to 16 October 2023, with a total sample of 100 MPs. Weights correcting for party affiliation (Conservative, Labour, SNP and Other), region (North, Mid, South), gender (female/male) and age were provided by Savanta and applied in the analysis so that the sample represents the distribution of these characteristics in the House of Commons. As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 below, the unweighted data closely matched key respondent characteristics in the House of Commons at the time of the survey.

Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 3, the impact of the survey weights on responses given to the knowledge question is minimal.

Publics survey

The publics surveys were fielded by Survation, which has a record of accuracy in polling, such as being the only member of the British Polling Council to correctly predict the hung parliament of the 2017 General Election59,60. Details of the fieldwork dates, sample size and quotas are included in Table 4. Weights were applied in the analysis so that the sample represents the distribution of key demographic characteristics at the national level; in addition to weighting based on the sampling quotas used, weights in Britain also accounted for votes at the 2019 General Election and the 2016 Brexit referendum; in Canada for votes at the 2021 Federal Election; in Chile for votes at the 2021 Presidential Election; and in Germany for votes at the 2021 Federal Election. Ethics approval for this study—including the procedure for receiving informed consent from participants—was approved on 18 November 2022 by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Subcommittee at the University of East Anglia (Ethics number: ETH2223-0575), and amendments approved by the same subcommittee on 2 October 2023 (Ethics number: ETH2324-0224).

Survey questions

The wording of the fielded knowledge question is as follows:

“In 2022, the UN IPCC—an international working group of scientists who regularly summarize scientific assessment on climate change—released a series of progress reports.

One of these reports provided a timescale by which global greenhouse gas emissions must peak [i.e., stop increasing] to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

When do you think this is? Even if you are unsure of the answer or are unfamiliar with the reports, please provide your best guess”.

Response options were: 2025; 2030; 2035; 2040; 2045; 2050

Other variables

Note: For all questions below, where respondents responded “don’t know”, these have been treated as missing variables in analyses.

Age: What is your age; Sex: What is your sex; Education: What is the highest educational level that you have?

Urbanity: Would you describe the place where you live as (1) A farm or town in the country, (2) A country village, (3) A small city or town, (4) The suburbs or outskirts of a big city, (5) A big city.

Subjective social status: In our society, there are groups which tend to be towards the top and groups which tend to be toward the bottom. Below is a scale that runs top to bottom. Where would you put yourself on this scale? (1. Bottom–10. Top).

Past vote at 2019 UK general election: Thinking back to the General Election in December 2019, can you recall which party you voted for in that election?

Left-right: In politics, people sometimes talk of “left” and “right”. Where would you place yourself on this scale, where 0 means the left and 10 means the right?

For anthropogenic climate change belief and climate worry, we use the questions as fielded in the European Social Survey42. For the conspiracy mentality index, we used the 5-item index of Bruder et al.61. The trust in scientists index is composed of responses to the following two statements, each asked on a 1–5 agree/disagree scale: “I trust scientists to create knowledge that is unbiased and accurate” and “I trust scientists to inform the public on important issues”62.

Empirical strategy

For Figs. 1–3, we carried out descriptive crosstabulations and created the bar charts from these. For Fig. 4, we carried out ordinary least squares regression models within each of our four countries, utilising provided survey weights to match demographic targets at the national level. The results are robust to also carrying out ordinal logistic regression models.

For publics, we can exclude respondents who answered the knowledge question in 5 s or less to account for inattentiveness, as well as those who took 1 min or more to respond for potentially looking the answer up. Leaving a sample of 1732 individuals in Britain, this does not significantly change response distributions.

While this could be good news for the growing adoption of EVs in the U.S., the big question is how much of the growth was tied to the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

F stock is trading at elevated levels. Follow the breaking news here.

Ford's Record Quarter

Ford reported third-quarter U.S. overall automotive sales up 8.2%, marking its seventh consecutive month of sales growth.

Electric vehicle sales hit 85,789 in the quarter, up 19.8% year-over-year.

The Mustang Mach-E had its best-ever quarter with sales up 50.7% year-over-year. The F-150 Lightning had sales of 10,005 in the quarter, up 16.5% quarter-over-quarter. The electric pickup truck remained America's best-selling EV truck in the quarter.

Year-to-date, Ford's EV sales are 242,298, up 16.5% year-over-year.

GM's Record Quarter

General Motors reported a record 66,501 electric vehicles sold in the third quarter.

The company acknowledged that the federal tax credit expiration led to strong demand from consumers.

GM also said the Equinox EV is the bestselling non-Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric vehicle in the U.S.

GM's Cadillac brand was also acknowledged for having three of the top 10 bestselling luxury EVs in the U.S. through September.

According to InsideEVs, General Motors has already passed its 2024 EV sales total with one quarter left to go. General Motors has sold 144,668 EVs year-to-date in 2025, up from the 114,432 EVs sold in 2024. EV sales are up 103% year-over-year through the first three quarters.

EV Growth or One Unique Quarter?

Along with GM and Ford, Tesla also turned in a record quarter, reporting 497,009 vehicles delivered in the third quarter.

The record quarters for electric vehicles come during the last quarter of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which expired after Sept. 30.

Some automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) are looking at ways to extend the $7,500 tax credit for consumers to keep demand high.

The fourth quarter could see a significant pullback from third-quarter numbers, but it will be interesting to see how much of a lift it gets from having some automakers working to offer incentives to customers.

For the U.S. EV market, the big test will likely be the first-quarter delivery numbers, which will include no impact from the $7,500 federal tax credit. The sector is likely to see a significant drop off in demand from the third quarter.

To keep the U.S. EV market growing, automakers likely need to work on ways to lower the price point without the credits closer to $30,000, or the country could look to Chinese EV companies that have lower price points in other markets and are taking share from Tesla and other U.S. companies.

,American Energy,2025-10-02 18:08:50+00:00,Wyoming Public Media,"Naughton power plant will stop burning coal, despite Trump announcement - Wyoming Public Media","Caitlin Tan, www.wyomingpublicmedia.org, caitlin-tan",,,,,https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/natural-resources-energy/2025-10-02/naughton-power-plant-will-stop-burning-coal-despite-trump-announcement,"He spoke specifically about the federal money that will go toward coal power plants slated to close or switch fully to natural gas.
Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of the multi-state utility PacifiCorp, owns several coal power plants in Wyoming.
Last year, Rocky Mountain Power switched two of the units at its Jim Bridger coal power plant, near Rock Springs, to natural gas.
It plans to do the same for three of the four units at its Dave Johnston coal plant in Converse County by the end of the decade.
However, in the company’s latest resource management plan, released this past spring, it removed a retirement date for its Wyodak coal plant in Campbell County.","The Trump administration says it’s the era of “mine, baby, mine.” The federal government is tossing money at power plants to keep them burning coal, but a main electricity provider in Wyoming says it’s sticking with plans to fully convert a coal plant to natural gas by the end of the year.

The Trump administration announced this week $625 million to “reinvigorate” the coal industry, which has declined since its peak in 2007.

“These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in the press release.

Wyoming politicians are cheering this on, saying it’s great news for the top producing coal state in the nation.

“This whole thing unshackles the energy industry from anti-coal production,” said Wyoming’s Gov. Mark Gordon in a Tuesday press call.

He spoke specifically about the federal money that will go toward coal power plants slated to close or switch fully to natural gas. It’s unclear how much will go to Wyoming, but Gordon said he hopes companies will upgrade their aging power plants, so they can burn both coal and natural gas depending on markets.

“That probably would be something that they'll start working on here pretty, pretty quickly,” Gordon said.

Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of the multi-state utility PacifiCorp, owns several coal power plants in Wyoming. Some of the units have switched to natural gas and others have plans to.

Spokesperson David Eskelsen said a retrofit to simultaneously burn coal and gas is, “Theoretically, it's certainly possible, but whether it would be cost effective is another question altogether.”

Despite the federal announcement, Eskelsen said the company still plans to fully switch its Naughton coal power plant, near Kemmerer, to natural gas at the end of the year.

“Our planning horizons tend to operate on much longer terms than changes in federal policy,” Eskelsen said. “There's no way that we can really speculate on what future changes might do.”

Eskelsen said the company has taken an all of the above energy approach, meaning it sees coal, natural gas, renewables and nuclear as part of the mix. He added that while coal is more dependable than renewables, it’s more expensive.

“The cost of our coal units has had a huge impact on the price that customers pay,” Eskelsen said.

Wyomingites have seen numerous rate hikes in recent years, causing their electricity bills to go up.

“So the job as a utility is to take the advantages of all resource types and use them together to create a useful product for customers,” he said.

Last year, Rocky Mountain Power switched two of the units at its Jim Bridger coal power plant, near Rock Springs, to natural gas. It plans to do the same for three of the four units at its Dave Johnston coal plant in Converse County by the end of the decade. The other unit will fully retire in 2027.

However, in the company’s latest resource management plan, released this past spring, it removed a retirement date for its Wyodak coal plant in Campbell County. Also, the two remaining coal-fired units at Jim Bridger will be retrofitted with carbon capture technology. The idea is to use carbon capture to release less emissions, although it’s largely unproven on a commercial scale. The company is moving forward with retrofit plans to comply with a Wyoming mandate, although that may soon be rolled back.

The Department of Interior also announced this week it’ll open up 13.1 million more federal acres to coal mining. This is also part of Pres. Trump’s executive orders for “Unleashing American Energy” and “reinvigorating” coal.

Part of the acreage will include the West Antelope III project, which is in northeast Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, the top producing coal region in the nation. The lease sale for this land is scheduled to happen in person Oct. 8 in Cheyenne. It’s the first coal lease sale in Wyoming since 2012.

During the press call, Gordon was also excited about the additional mining. But he weighed in on what this means for CO2 emissions.

“I think probably the answer is fairly clear. There'll be more CO2 production,” Gordon said.

But he added that more investment in coal will help advance technology to make it a more eco-friendly product.

Burning coal is the largest contributor to climate change according to multiple studies, but it’s the second largest energy source worldwide. Scientists generally agree those emissions must be reduced to limit the worst impacts. However, the Trump administration is trying to roll back findings that show those emissions are harmful.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11db0bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2Fb3%2Fece7161e41f6b43d649669d2fc21%2Fnaughton-summer.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 15:02:39.933533

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

“There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies.
UMass Lowell, MIT, and other institutions offer world-class academic, research, and training programs for those interested in advancing and working with nuclear technologies.
Today, there are two operating nuclear power plants in New England, with nuclear energy meeting approximately 20 to 25% of the region’s power needs each year.
I applaud the Healey-Driscoll administration for recognizing the important role nuclear energy has played in building a strong economy, and the potential advanced nuclear and fusion energy can and will play in the Commonwealth’s future.","Lowell — The Healey-Driscoll Administration is teaming up with University of Massachusetts Lowell to develop “Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps” to accelerate the state’s leadership in advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. The roadmaps will look at the distinct attributes and regulatory paradigms of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies and lay the foundation for further research, manufacturing and, ultimately, deployment of these technologies, to help affordably, reliably and sustainably meet increasing electricity demand in New England.

“Massachusetts has the ingredients to be a world-class leader in advanced nuclear and fusion energy – technologies that provide affordable power, good jobs and significant economic development,” said Governor Maura Healey. “There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Our partnership with UMass Lowell will help us leverage our strengths to lower costs and grow these industries in Massachusetts.”

“Massachusetts has built many multi-billion-dollar industries on a strong foundation of good research and ingenuity, and we can do that again with advanced nuclear and fusion energy,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “With a clear, actionable roadmap, we can move quickly to attract investment to our state and grow our economy.”

“Nuclear power looks a lot different in 2025 – it uses a smaller footprint, produces less waste, and can be factory-assembled,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Massachusetts wants to seize this opportunity for more additional reliable power. This industry is taking off, and Massachusetts can act quickly to position ourselves to attract new business opportunities and clean energy resources to the state.”

Massachusetts has a strong existing competitive advantage in advanced nuclear and fusion energy as the industries evolve nationwide. UMass Lowell and MIT both have nuclear research reactors, representing two of the 25 research reactors that exist nationally. The nuclear research conducted within Massachusetts forms the foundation for numerous world-leading industries, including energy, defense, heath care, and biomedical applications, notably cancer research. UMass Lowell, MIT, and other institutions offer world-class academic, research, and training programs for those interested in advancing and working with nuclear technologies. This includes a program at UMass Lowell for students to secure a reactor operator license.

“The University of Massachusetts is pleased to support the Healey-Driscoll Administration by leading the development of the Commonwealth’s nuclear and fusion energy roadmaps,” UMass President Marty Meehan said. “The UMass system is committed to advancing energy and climate tech innovations while also providing highly skilled graduates to drive economic development across the state. With its long-standing and successful nuclear science and engineering program, UMass Lowell is the perfect partner to lead this initiative and explore viable options and opportunities for partnership with our community, state, federal, and industry partners.”

“UMass Lowell is delighted to lead this key effort in partnership with the Healey Driscoll Administration,” said UMass Lowell Chancellor Julie Chen. “Energy expertise is a core strength at UMass Lowell and a big reason why we are the only AASHE STARS platinum rated campus in Massachusetts. Our team looks forward to a collaborative and engaging process that will outline viable options to enhance energy affordability, decarbonization, and economic development for the Commonwealth.”

“We selected Massachusetts as our global headquarters because of the world-class ecosystem that has enabled us to tap into the skilled workforce and talent to both manufacture and build the world’s first commercially relevant fusion machine that will demonstrate fusion can work as a commercial energy source,” said Bob Mumgaard, Commonwealth Fusion Systems CEO and co-founder. “We are excited about the Healey Driscoll Administration’s strategic roadmaps to position the Commonwealth to deploy this disruptive new clean energy technology.”

Massachusetts is home to the MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which is a global leader in fusion research. Additionally, it is home to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, headquartered in Devens, which is developing commercial-scale fusion technology. Incubated in Cambridge and spun out of MIT, CFS is now a multi-billion-dollar company employing nearly 1,000 people in Massachusetts, including engineers, electricians, technicians, welders, pipefitters, and construction workers.

Today, there are two operating nuclear power plants in New England, with nuclear energy meeting approximately 20 to 25% of the region’s power needs each year. With electricity demand growing, there is significant interest in exploring cutting-edge small modular reactors and fusion power plants. The New England states are working together, with support from the National Governors Association, to explore potential investment models for the deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies.

Sukesh Aghara, Ph.D. will lead the development of the roadmap. He is a Professor of Nuclear Engineering, Ex-Chair and Executive Member of Nuclear Engineering Department Heads Organization, and current Associate Dean for Research of the Francis College of Engineering. The roadmaps will serve as a comprehensive framework to guide Massachusetts’ approach to exploring advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies for power generation and non-power generation applications. Over the four-month effort, UMass Lowell will engage stakeholders from across the UMass system, industry, government, and communities to assess existing capabilities, identify key gaps, and define opportunities for Massachusetts to lead in shaping the state’s and region’s advanced nuclear and fusion energy ecosystems. The roadmaps will outline steps to leverage Massachusetts' existing innovation ecosystem, scale workforce development programs to support long-term industry growth, develop strategies for inclusive community engagement, and coordinate planning efforts with other New England states. The roadmaps will not consider specific sites or restarting decommissioned facilities. It will serve as a foundational document to inform future legislative, regulatory, and investment decisions. The roadmaps are expected to be released by the end of the year.

Governor Healey’s Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act would would remove a barrier to deploying advanced nuclear technologies by lifting an outdated requirement for a statewide ballot measure for every new nuclear power plant. While fusion power plants are already excluded from this requirement, this change would keep Massachusetts competitive as other nuclear technology advances such as small modular reactors. Between 2020 and today, eight of the fourteen states with some form of nuclear moratorium have lifted limitations, while other states have advanced various kinds of pro-nuclear incentives.

Statements of Support:

Chrissy Lynch, President of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO:

""We need more energy in Massachusetts, plain and simple. We can generate massive amounts of energy right here in Massachusetts through clean energy sources like advanced nuclear and fusion, and create thousands of union jobs for Massachusetts residents while we do it. I applaud Governor Healey for figuring out how we in Massachusetts can generate our own energy and support thousands of local careers at the same time.""

Harry Brett, International Representative for the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada:

“There is a bright future for advanced nuclear and fusion energy in Massachusetts. United Association members are building, operating, and maintaining nuclear systems across the country, and we stand ready to bring more advanced energy solutions to our Commonwealth with the highest quality and safety in the industry.”

Kevin Knobloch, President of Knobloch Energy LLC; former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Energy; former President of the Union of Concerned Scientists; and former CEO and President, Greentown Labs:

""We in Massachusetts are proud of our tradition of braving new frontiers in response to great challenges and needs. The UMass Lowell roadmap exercise is a vital investigation that will build on Massachusetts' long and impactful history in developing nuclear energy as a clean and firm energy source. The brisk timeline to identify options to strengthen our state's leadership in this sector shows a commitment by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to taking action when there’s not a minute to lose. Governor Healey’s initiative is key to meeting rising electricity demand with new power sources – such as small modular reactors – that are reliable, affordable, safe, carbon free and scalable.""

Dan Leary, President of UWUA Local 369:

“Massachusetts and the region need more energy supply. The men and women of UWUA stand ready to make sure that energy supply operates safely and reliably. I applaud the Healey-Driscoll administration for recognizing the important role nuclear energy has played in building a strong economy, and the potential advanced nuclear and fusion energy can and will play in the Commonwealth’s future. Advanced nuclear and fusion energy have the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs, meet our growing energy needs without impacting the climate or local air quality, and ensure we have a stable and reliable energy grid for decades to come.”

John G. Tzimorangas, President and CEO of Energy New England and President of Northeast Public Power Association (NEPPA):

""Public Power has long been an advocate of nuclear power as part of its resource portfolio. This has helped public power balance the cost and reliability aspects that have been a cornerstone of municipal utilities. The public power community is excited and encouraged about the prospect of advanced nuclear (including SMR's) and fusion, with our own Commonwealth Fusion leading the way. Our regional organization, Northeast Public Power Association, has a resolution to promote Advanced Nuclear and Fusion technology and we are excited to support the Commonwealth's initiatives.”

Michael Collins, MD, UMass Chan Medical School Chancellor:

“Advancing nuclear and fusion energy technology to better deliver power in Massachusetts will reduce air pollution, improve climate resilience and enhance public health. Developing and employing clean energy will lead to cleaner air and that means better public health for all, particularly for our most vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to air pollution and heat stress.”

Tom Barry, CEO of the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company:

“The Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company (MMWEC) is a steadfast supporter of nuclear energy, as a joint owner of Millstone Unit 3 and Seabrook Station, and has extolled the benefits of nuclear for decades. As the Commonwealth’s joint action agency for municipal utilities, MMWEC is uniquely positioned to work with the Administration to move forward with these technologies. We believe this next generation of advanced nuclear and fusion energy is essential for improving regional energy independence, and will be a critical piece of our decarbonized future.”

Mike Monohan, Vice President of IBEW Region 2:

“Every day, thousands of IBEW members go to work in nuclear plants around the country and go home safely every night to their families. They keep the lights on, provide affordable electricity for tens of millions of Americans and businesses, and support the economies of their local communities. Nuclear energy provides good jobs, clean power, and operates with the highest standards for safety. Period. Today, New Englanders rely on nuclear for more than 20% of their electricity, and Massachusetts consumes more of that energy than any other state in the region. Governor Healey and her team are spot on – we need to look at what Massachusetts can do to build and expand the nuclear and fusion energy ecosystems we have here in Massachusetts and figure out how our energy consumers can benefit from these clean energy resources, and how we can make sure our people and communities don’t lose out on opportunities for high paying, long-term jobs.”

Armond Cohen, Executive Director of Clean Air Task Force (CATF):

“Clean firm power like nuclear fission and fusion can help drive rapid, affordable, reliable decarbonization and complement the deployment of weather-dependent renewable energy. By developing a coordinated roadmap for these technologies, Massachusetts is moving decisively to expand clean firm power in a way that can drive economic growth and benefit communities, leveraging world-class research institutions, attracting investment, and creating high-quality jobs all while delivering low-carbon power to meet growing electricity demand. Strategic planning like this ensures that these technologies are deployed safely and equitably, strengthening Massachusetts’ competitive edge in the clean energy economy and advancing regional climate goals.”

Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.
The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom's office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.
The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified.
""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election.

The cuts were announced in a social media post late Wednesday by Russell Vought, the White House budget director: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens cuts and firings in his fight with congressional Democrats over the federal government shutdown.

These cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts include $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. The private sector has committed $10 billion for the hydrogen hub, Newsom's office said, adding that canceling the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems threatens over 200,000 jobs.

“Clean hydrogen deserves to be part of California’s energy future — creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and saving billions in health costs,” the Democratic governor said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said. The awards totaled more than $3.1 billion.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that climate change threatens public health. Many climate scientists have criticized the EPA effort as biased and misleading.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

""This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,'' said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Vought said the projects being cut are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades.","The Department of Energy is cancelling more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.

The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a government shutdown and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought posted on the social media site X that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a news release that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""

The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:

Clean Energy Demonstrations, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Grid Deployment, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure

Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security

Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies

Fossil Energy, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.

Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, posted on X.

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought announced the funding freeze in a post on X.

Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, said on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.

The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as electricity demand is expected to rise significantly for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to limit the construction of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they can be built quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

""Ripping funding away from only blue states will raise utility bills for EVERYONE,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on X. ""It's not rocket science.""

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, spoke at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi, a forum for Russia experts. He spoke in Russian and his words were translated by. Here are some main quotes. TOMAHAWK MISSILES - UKRAINE It is impossible to use Tomahawks in the absence of direct involvement by American military personnel. This would be a qualitatively and completely new level of escalation in both the relations between Russia, and the United States. On TRUMP's description of Russia as a paper tigger: ""A paper tiger. What happens next? ""Go and deal with the paper tiger."" ""Well, if we're fighting with the whole NATO bloc, we're moving, advancing and we feel confident and we're a paper Tiger, then what exactly is NATO?"" HYSTERIA AMONG EUROPE’S LEADERS ""The ruling class of Europe continues to stir up hysteria. The war with Russia is almost at our doorstep. This mantra is repeated over and over. ... Can't they believe that Russia will attack NATO, as they say? ... ""They're either dishonest or incredibly incompetent, if they believe that nonsense. It's impossible to accept this."" ON RUSSIA'S RESPONSE TO EUROPEAN MILITARY BUILDUP: ""We cannot ignore the situation."" For our own safety, we have no right to ignore what is happening. Our defence and safety, I repeat. We are therefore closely monitoring the militarization of Europe."" ""Are they just empty words or is it the time to countermeasure? Germany, for instance, claims that the German Army should be the strongest in Europe. Good. ""We listen to what the speaker is saying and understand it."" I don't think anyone doubts that these measures will force Russia into action, and Russia will have countermeasures in no time. I think that (to put it mildly) the response to such threats will be very convincing. On the Ukraine Conflict: ""We thank all countries who have been sincere in their efforts to find a solution to this problem over the past few years."" This includes our partners, the founding members in BRICS, Belarus, and, by the way North Korea. In the Arab World as a group, primarily the UAE along with many other countries. ""Unfortunately, the fighting has not stopped, but responsibility does not lie with the majority of countries, but rather with a small minority in Europe who are constantly escalating conflict."" RELATIVE TO RELATIONS WITH UNITED STATES We all know that our countries have many differences. We have different views on global issues. It is not unusual for major powers to clash. ""In fact, it is important to determine how these differences can be resolved and whether they can be settled peacefully."" The current White House administration expresses its desires and interests directly,... and bluntly - but without unnecessary hypocrisy."" ""We can see that the U.S. government is primarily guided by its own interest, as they understand them. This is, I think, a rational strategy. If you'll excuse me, Russia reserves the right to follow its own national interests. ""One of them, incidentally is the restoration to full-fledged relationships with the U.S. 'FIGHTING"" BETWEEN RUSSIA & NATO The Ukrainian military is being supported by a center in Europe that supports all of the NATO countries' actions. It transmits space intelligence, provides weapons, and offers training. On the Course of the Fight: ""Our troops are confidently moving forward along virtually the entire line-of-contact."" ""We control nearly 100% of the Luhansk Region."" The enemy controls just over 19% of the Donetsk Region, and 24-25% in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. ""And everywhere, Russian troops maintain the strategic lead with confidence."" On Trump's Gaza Plan: ""In general, Russia will support it."" As long as it achieves the ultimate goal that we have discussed. Russia has always... advocated for the creation of two state - Israel and a Palestinian State. This, I believe, is the only way to find a permanent solution to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict."" US CALLS INDIA TO RENOUNCE RUSSIAN ENERGY ""If India refuses to accept our energy supply, it will suffer certain losses... Of course, I believe that the people of India will closely monitor any decisions made by political leaders and will never tolerate humiliation before anyone. ""I know that Prime Minister Modi would never do such a thing."" On Alleged UKRAINIAN Strikes on ZAPORIZHZHIA Nuclear Plant: ""This is a very dangerous game.

ON CONTINUED EXPORTS OF URANIUM TO THE U.S.: The United States is one, if no the largest state, that uses nuclear power plants. Russia is the second biggest supplier of uranium for the American market. On Alaska Summit with TRUMP ""President Trump, I and my team discussed virtually nothing at the meeting. Not even our bilateral agenda."" We discussed only the ways and possibilities to resolve the Ukrainian Crisis.

On the French seizure of a Russian oil tanker: ""Well, I think it's piracy... A tanker has been seized without justification in international waters. They were looking for cargo - maybe drones or military equipment. ""None of it was there nor could it have been."" RUSSIA’S ECONOMY ""We must strengthen our financial system."" Two things are important. ""First, we need to further strengthen macroeconomic stabilization and reduce inflation while still attempting to maintain positive growth rates."" ""But we agreed at the end last year that we would sacrifice our record-breaking rates of growth in order to fight inflation.

Tesla records record deliveries; concerns grow over EV demand after tax credits

Tesla reported record quarterly deliveries Thursday. However, concerns that the U.S. Tax Credit for EVs will expire soon and turn a rush into a trickle weighed down its shares. Elon Musk's carmaker, which is led by Elon Musk, went all-in to boost sales prior to the removal of the $7.500 federal tax credit. They used a combination discounts, financing offers, social media ads, and emails from customers. ""I am skeptical that this will last and I believe we could have a couple of soft quarters,"" said Elliot Johnson. He is the chief investment officer for Evolve ETFs which manages Tesla investments. Johnson explained that the sales spike was due to a pull-forward of demand to lock in incentives rather than a growing consumer interest. He added it wouldn't be irrational to investors to ""sell news"" and purchase again next year. Tesla shares fell 3.4% during afternoon trading. Stocks have been rising recently, up 14% in the last year at Wednesday's closing. This is after Musk's pay package was proposed by the board. Tesla and its competitors received government credits to use them in attractive leases. Tesla is now offering leases after the credits expire. Lease prices are rising Tesla offers a credit for its vehicles. Tesla's prices, excluding credit, remain unchanged. The company announced on Thursday that it had delivered 497.099 vehicles in the three-month period ended September. This is up 7.4% compared to 462,890 vehicles a year ago, and far above the expectations of Wall Street, which was for 443,919 cars. Model 3 compact sedans, as well as its most popular Model Y crossovers, accounted for 481,166 of the deliveries. The automaker will report its quarterly results on Tuesday, October 22. According to Troy Teslike an independent Tesla researcher, the strong demand for the refreshed Model Y has helped boost sales in China. In September, it began delivering the six seat Model Y L to China. This family-oriented variant is designed to boost demand in the largest EV market in the world. Europe, on the other hand, was a weak point as competitors aggressively promoted plug in hybrids. Meanwhile, Chinese EV brands began gaining ground on a hyper-competitive marketplace. According to the Automobile Manufacturers' Association of the region, the company's European sales in August fell by 22.5% compared to a year ago, reducing its market share from 2.5% to just 1.5%. Visible Alpha projects that Tesla will deliver 1.61 million vehicles in 2025, which is roughly 10% less than 2024. Tesla must deliver 389.498 vehicles during the December quarter in order to meet this projection. Rivian, a smaller competitor, lowered its midpoint forecast for annual deliveries on Thursday, but exceeded estimates for quarter-end deliveries due to an increase in demand by buyers eager to take advantage tax credits. MUSK AND TESLA Musk's wealth is largely derived from his Tesla holdings. A recent rise in the stock price of the company helped him surpass the $500 billion mark Wednesday. This boosted his position as the richest person on the planet. The board of directors has proposed that shareholders vote on a new award for the CEO. This could give Musk 12% ownership in the company worth up to $1 trillion if certain performance and valuation goals are met. These include delivering 20,000,000 vehicles within a 10 year period. The billionaire has positioned Tesla as more of a technology company rather than an EV manufacturer by focusing on AI based self-driving system, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Cheaper Models Tesla has delayed the launch of the Model Y, a lower-cost variant, in the U.S. by several months. The plan is to eventually build the variants in China and Europe. Tesla announced in June that the company had built ""first builds"" but that they would begin selling the vehicles in the fourth quarter, and increase production slower than expected. Analysts say that Tesla's ability cushion a slowdown after the credit crunch will be heavily dependent on its push to lower-priced model. Matt Britzman is a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown and personally owns Tesla stock. Sources told us earlier this year that the stripped-down model is intended to be about 20% cheaper to manufacture than the refreshed Model Y. It could scale up to around 250,000 units a month in the U.S.",https://energynews.oedigital.com/img/energy-news-sqr.svg,N,,2025-10-02 20:01:21.753317

Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The move comes as President Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.

The Energy Department said in a statement Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other DOE bureaus.

The cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Russell Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”

He said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.

Vought and the Energy Department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both U.S. senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.

The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.

Trump said in an interview taped Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want — “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

“I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said. A clip from the interview was released ahead of the full interview set to air Thursday night.

Trump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10 billion for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. The cut threatens over 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.

California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

The California project is one of seven clean-energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7 billion program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to slow climate change.

The DOE said it has reviewed billions of dollars awarded by the Biden administration after Trump won the presidential election last November. More than a quarter of the rescinded grants were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the department said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

He ignored questions at the White House on Thursday about how the 16 states were chosen. Award recipients have 30 days to appeal the DOE’s termination decision.

The Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the Energy Department rescinded $13 billion that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.

Democrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.

“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at NRDC.

Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the U.S.’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.

In-stock availability rose to 48%, though many buyers still visited multiple dealerships or ordered from the factory.

Financing improved, and 24% of customers completed purchases faster than expected.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases officially ended on Sept. 30 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Despite the rush of customers into showrooms to take advantage of the savings, the buying experience remained strong. According to CDK Global’s Ease of Purchase index, 89% customers said that it was easy to purchase a vehicle in September. This score remains unchanged from August and aligns with the September 2024 results.

Recently, finding the desired vehicle at a dealership has become increasingly complex for customers. In September, in-stock vehicle availability improved to 48%, a three-point increase from August, although still below the ideal benchmark of 50%. Approximately 12% of buyers had to visit four or more dealerships to find the vehicle they were looking for. Another 23% had to order their vehicle from the factory, and only 8% were able to find an alternative in stock.

As part of that rule, the EPA is evaluating whether to reallocate 100% or 50% of refinery exemptions granted for 2023 and 2024, as well as those anticipated for 2025.

During his remarks at the hearing, IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw strongly urged the EPA to finalize its proposal to reallocate 100% of the 2023-2025 refinery exemptions. “The law requires EPA’s prime directive to be ensuring RFS blending levels are met,” said Shaw. “Only full reallocation will maintain the integrity to the RFS and deliver meaningful benefits to rural America.”

Shaw noted that while the delays and backlogs of processing the refinery exemption requests were inherited by the current EPA, it is their duty to fully implement the RFS.

“IRFA strongly believes EPA should finalize its proposal to reallocate 100% of the exemptions over 2026-2027. We are concerned by reports that a 50% reallocation scheme is gaining steam. If EPA ultimately determines that 100% reallocation over 2026-2027 is not possible, the agency should not undermine the RFS with 50% reallocation. Instead, as an alternative, the EPA should reallocate 100% of the 2023-2025 exemptions over four years. This approach would have the same market impact in the short term as 50% reallocation but would still provide lasting support for American farmers and the biofuels industry.”

Shaw also commended the EPA for proposing strong RFS blending levels, stating, “The originally proposed blending levels for 2026 and 2027 were robust and appreciated. While we disagree with the metrics used to grant recent refinery exemptions, IRFA appreciates the agency’s responsible handling of refinery exemptions granted from 2016 to 2022 and its commitment to prospectively reallocate future exemptions beginning in 2026.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2023/04/20220052/pexels-ekaterina-belinskaya-4744707-845x563.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:38.167604

While the more than 4 million votes for “yes” outnumbered the more than 1.5 million “no” votes, the number of affirmative votes failed to surpass the 25 percent threshold of eligible voters also required for the referendum to pass. As a result, Taiwan remains on the nuclear-free path it has followed since the shutdown of the nuclear plant in question, Maanshan nuclear power plant, in southern Taiwan on 17 May, fulfilling a 2016 government pledge made as a result of Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster.

However, high-tech industries including semiconductor manufacturing, AI data centers and AI infrastructure operators, will continue fueling electricity demand. The question remains as to whether or not Taiwan can deliver reliable, clean power to support the growth of these industries amid Chinese geopolitical pressure—and without nuclear energy.

Taiwan’s Nuclear Energy Debate

Taiwan’s energy landscape remains complex. Nuclear power, developed since the 1970s, has seen older reactors retired since 2018. Taiwan imports 95 percent of its energy and has a growing reliance on natural gas. But it also aims to reduce carbon emissions, improve grid reliability, and expand its energy storage options.

“Without energy, there’s no industrial growth… and nuclear is an excellent option,” NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said during a pre-referendum visit to Taipei on 22 August. He met with key players in high-tech supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest chip foundry producing advanced chips for smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications.

It was not Huang’s first time advocating for nuclear energy. During Computex Taipei in May he said, “We need energy from any single source: wind, solar, nuclear. Taiwan should absolutely invest in nuclear, and it shouldn’t be a stigma to have energy.”

Nvidia has been expanding in Taiwan, partnering with Foxconn and the government to build a 10,000-Blackwell GPU AI training and supercomputing facility in the south, opening a larger Taipei office, and collaborating with Taiwanese companies such as TSMC to build an AI infrastructure ecosystem.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te promised to honor the referendum result while focusing on diverse energy sources. He said Taiwan might consider advanced nuclear options if technology improves, waste decreases, and public support grows.

In late August, the government approved a draft piece of legislation, the AI Basic Act, designed to create a supportive environment for AI development and use. The draft emphasizes the government’s role in promoting AI research, applications, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the newly reshuffled Cabinet is under pressure by industry and the broader public to maintain energy security.

In mid-September, newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Ming-hsin Kung emphasized that Taiwan is a global hub for chips and technology, shaping strategies for the next 10 to 20 years.

Taiwan’s Renewable Energy Goals

Kung stressed that businesses require both stable power supply and green energy to meet commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from global corporate initiative RE110. He said the new Cabinet will continue focusing on renewable energy while adjusting rollout speed. The goal is to lift renewables to 20 percent of Taiwan’s power supply by the end of 2026—a challenging target critical in keeping Taiwan competitive in global supply chains. He estimated renewable energy will account for around 15 percent of power generation by the end of 2025, up from 11.9 percent in 2024.

For solar, Kung pledged to strengthen existing projects, resolve land-use conflicts with fish farms in solar-fishery initiatives, and replace older solar panels with newer ones that produce twice as much energy. Offshore wind construction will be accelerated, and a trial program for floating wind turbines will resume. Taiwan will also actively develop other green energy sources, such as geothermal and hydrogen.

On nuclear, Kung reaffirmed Taiwan’s nuclear-free path but left open the possibility of adopting advanced technologies like small modular reactors. Guidelines for evaluating potential restarts of existing plants will be released by the end of October. The first step will see the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) conducting assessments of all three halted nuclear plants, with initial results due next year. Maanshan, which began commercial operations in 1984, is regarded as the most likely to pass the safety self-assessments, which will focus on the ability to maintain aging equipment and upgrade earthquake resilience.

In a report released on 26 September, Taiwan’s Energy Administration projects electricity demand to grow 1.7 percent annually from 2025 to 2034. The forecast factors in expansions to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, investments in AI development, and expected energy savings.

To meet rising power demand, the government currently plans to boost natural gas generation while phasing out large nuclear, coal, and oil plants. Net additions of 12.2 gigawatts in gas-fired capacity are expected by 2034.

Semiconductor Industry Concerns

But high-tech industries express concern. In early September, at SEMICON Taiwan, Charles Lee, the managing director of Topco Group, a major semiconductor supplier, told IEEE Spectrum that manufacturers worry about grid stability as AI and semiconductor growth accelerates. “Highly polluting coal-fired plants are no longer an option, so we will rely more on liquefied natural gas and less-stable renewables. If nuclear plants could be restarted, I would personally welcome it,” Lee says.

Meanwhile, a memory manufacturing director, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he isn’t authorized by his company to speak to the media, told IEEE Spectrum that Taiwan’s economy is still manufacturing-driven. “We’re concerned about the low efficiency of green energy. We’ve also noticed a trend abroad, with countries resuming nuclear plant construction,” he says.

In a televised debate ahead of the August referendum, Tzu-Hsien Tung, chairman of Pegatron Corporation, voiced support for restarting nuclear power plants. He warned that if Taiwan continues to rely on carbon-heavy electricity, local firms could face steep carbon taxes overseas, undermining their global competitiveness.

As Taiwanese society debated whether to restart nuclear power plants, some Taiwanese energy experts, including Tze-Luen Lin, deputy executive director of the Taiwanese government’s Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction and a political science professor at National Taiwan University, have called for fresh approaches to Taiwan’s energy resilience amid ongoing Chinese threats, echoing to notions brought by non-governmental organizations and thinkthanks, such as the U.S.-based Center for Climate and Security, that a clean energy transition can strengthen national security.

At the Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies conference in Japan on 21 September, Lin highlighted that renewable energy is central to both energy and national security. He emphasized, “Energy resilience can only be strengthened through decentralized, locally sourced renewables, combined with microgrids and energy storage,” and warned that large, centralized power plants are easier targets for attack.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61689921&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C12%2C0%2C588,N,,2025-10-02 16:01:29.581986

​

ANNAPOLIS, MD — Governor Wes Moore today announced a historic agreement with Constellation Energy to fund and implement operational improvements and environmental projects at the Conowingo Dam. The commitments—valued at more than $340 million and negotiated in partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association—will meet enforceable water quality standards by mitigating the impacts associated with the dam’s operation.

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” said Gov. Moore. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers. By bringing everyone to the table, we have struck an agreement that is good for the environment, good for energy production, and good for Marylanders.”

The agreement clears the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of the dam’s hydroelectric facility on the Susquehanna River, which is the largest source of renewable energy in the state. The terms of the agreement, announced today at the dam, include operational improvements and upfront and ongoing annual payments:

Water quality and resiliency: $87.6 million for pollution reduction and resiliency initiatives, including shoreline restoration, forest buffers, fish passage projects and planting underwater grasses that produce oxygen, stabilize sediments and provide habitat for countless species.

Trash and debris removal: $77.8 million to strengthen efforts that already clear an average of about 600 tons of debris each year, with innovative approaches like barging for removal.

Aquatic life passage: More than $28 million for fish and eel passage improvements and protections at the dam, helping American shad, river herring, and freshwater mussels rebound while reconnecting habitats across the Susquehanna.

Freshwater mussel restoration: $23.3 million to build and operate a hatchery that will seed the river with mussels, which, like oysters, are natural filters that clean the water and reduce pollution flowing into the Bay.

Dredging: $18.7 million to support additional studies on dredging and related activities.

Invasive species management: $9.4 million to control destructive species like snakeheads and blue catfish, protecting the river’s ecosystem and supporting Maryland’s fishing economy.

Ongoing: Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Waterkeepers Chesapeake have an ongoing role in aspects of the implementation of the certification and settlement agreement.

“This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” said Attorney General Anthony G. Brown. “I'm proud of our office’s tireless efforts in this case to improve water quality and protect the lives and livelihoods of Marylanders who depend on these essential waterways for recreation and work.”

The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment and a companion settlement agreement. The department issues certifications pursuant to authority from Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. For a dam, a certification works like a permit and has conditions and requirements for the operation of the dam.

An initial certification was issued in 2018, but legal challenges led to a 2019 waiver of that certification and settlement, requiring the dam owner to invest in improvements valued at $230 million. The terms were dependent on the facility’s receipt of a 50-year federal license, but an appeals court vacated that license in 2022.

To reach the agreement announced today, the extensive reconsideration process included a public comment period and more than a year of mediation involving the State, Constellation, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Waterkeepers Chesapeake, leading to the agreement announced today. A Revised Water Quality Certification will be filed with the federal government for the dam’s license to be renewed.

“With this agreement, we are protecting clean water and vibrant ecosystems for generations to come while supporting jobs, commerce, and energy security,” said Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain. “All parties—including environmental groups who challenged a previous framework—have signed on. From restored fisheries to enhanced recreation and tourism, the benefits of a healthier Susquehanna River flow through our communities, our industries, and the Chesapeake Bay.”

“The Susquehanna watershed is home to one of the largest concentrations of clean energy generation in America, and Constellation is proud to build on that nearly century-old legacy, investing heavily in clean generation, protecting water quality and powering Maryland’s economy,” said Constellation President and Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez. “But it’s not just the scale of the investments we are making that makes us proud, it’s how we are investing. Some utility monopolies are claiming they can lower your electricity costs by building new generation, but they want you to guarantee their profits. That’s just not fair, especially now, when many families are already struggling to pay higher electricity bills. In the last decade, Constellation has invested more than $1 billion in Maryland clean energy projects, from wind and hydro to state-of-the-art nuclear energy, and we will never ask Maryland families to bear business risks that we won’t.”

Cleaner waterways bolster tourism in Maryland, which generates about $3.2 billion a year in economic activity. Improved water quality and habitat also benefits Maryland’s seafood industry, which contributes nearly $600 million to the state’s economy each year.

“The relicensing of Conowingo Dam is critical to the health of the Susquehanna River and the overall restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” said Waterkeepers Chesapeake Acting Executive Director Robin Broder. “Today’s agreement marks a new era for the dam and a new commitment for clean water. The funding for water quality projects, a pathway to dredging, and investments in living resources such as the freshwater mussel hatchery are significant steps forward. Though more than a decade in the making, this agreement is not the end of our efforts, but rather the beginning of an important new chapter. Waterkeepers Chesapeake and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper look forward to providing oversight on the implementation of this important agreement.”

“Today’s announcement marks 16 years of tremendous effort and perseverance by our organization to assure Conowingo Dam is relicensed with proper conditions that protect the health of the Lower Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay,” said Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper and Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association Executive Director Ted Evgeniadis. “Without the unwavering commitment of the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper, dredging the reservoir to stop harmful pulses of sediment and pollution from reaching the bay would not have been considered. In partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake, our successful appeal of the license and the 2019 Settlement brought the parties back together to renegotiate far better terms that will improve water quality and protect our aquatic species for the next 50 years.”

Once the conditions of the Revised Water Quality Certification are incorporated in the dam’s operating license, Maryland will ensure that the obligations in the Certification are fully and effectively enforced.

“Restoring the Chesapeake Bay is both an environmental and economic imperative for Maryland – countless lives and livelihoods throughout the watershed depend on it,” said U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen. “This agreement marks a major step toward a healthier Bay and a stronger Maryland. With it we are poised to make important strides in improving water quality and bolstering our seafood and outdoor recreation – while securing a key source of clean energy for our state for years to come.”

“I am looking forward to this $340 million agreement which will invest in environmental projects over the next 50 years to support the health of the Susquehanna River and the beating heart of our state – the Chesapeake Bay,” said U.S. Senator Angela Alsobrooks. “This settlement will continue to provide reliable, clean energy for Maryland, clean up our environment by removing trash and debris, control invasive species, protect our ecosystem, and improve our state's water quality.”

“I am proud that all parties, under the leadership of Governor Wes Moore and his administration, reached an agreement on the Conowingo Dam that balances the needs of all Marylanders,” said U.S. Congressman Steny Hoyer. “The Conowingo Dam settlement represents an important investment in the health of our treasured Chesapeake Bay, something I have spent my career fighting for, as well as a clear path forward for Conowingo to continue providing clean, reliable power for Maryland and the broader region.”

“The Conowingo Dam, while an important renewable source of energy for the State of Maryland, has also played a role in sediment reaching the Chesapeake Bay,” said U.S. Congressman Kweisi Mfume. “I commend Governor Wes Moore and the Maryland Department of the Environment’s success in bringing all parties together for a new Conowingo Dam settlement agreement which will increase investment into environmental remediation and restoration.”

“The new Conowingo Dam settlement is an excellent example of solutions-oriented stakeholder engagement,” said U.S. Congresswoman Sarah Elfreth. “The impact of this historic investment in water quality and the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem will have generational impacts, including the development of a new freshwater mussel hatchery, water quality monitoring, and combating invasive species like the blue catfish. I look forward to the implementation of these exciting projects.”

“It is critical we protect and invest in the Chesapeake Bay — a cultural and economic lifeline for our state,” said U.S. Congressman Johnny Olszewski. “I applaud our state agencies and Constellation for their collaboration with local conservation organizations to reach a deal that will strengthen the health of the Bay for years to come. I thank all of the stakeholders who understood the urgent need to support this essential Chesapeake tributary and clean energy source.”

“With this historic agreement, we’re making a commitment to better protect our state’s water quality and vital ecosystems all while creating a brighter future for clean energy,” said U.S. Congresswoman April McClain Delaney. “The Conowingo Dam’s re-licensing and operational improvements mean our environment and waterways are better off — along with the Maryland communities that depend on them for everything from commercial prosperity to hydroelectric power. This is a win for innovation, for our Maryland businesses, and for protecting our water resources.”

“The Conowingo Dam has been providing the lowest cost renewable energy electricity to Marylanders for decades, and, with this agreement, will be allowed to continue to do so,” said U.S. Congressman Andy Harris.

“This deal ensures we balance the importance of generating renewable energy while protecting water quality standards and the broader ecosystem,” said Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary and Chesapeake Bay Program Principals’ Staff Committee Chair Josh Kurtz. “The settlement will allow us to apply the innovative strategies we developed restoring oysters in Chesapeake Bay tributaries to bring back water-filtering mussels in the Susquehanna River basin and other freshwater rivers in Maryland. Thank you to everyone who helped us reach this agreement.”

Governor Moore included more than $400 million in his FY26 budget for Chesapeake Bay and clean water projects that create local jobs, improve public spaces, and enhance property values. Building on this commitment, Maryland has taken action to decrease pollution and crafted a new bay strategy focused on industry best practices.

In May, Governor Moore signed the Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act, which supports sustainable farming, expands oyster restoration, and modernizes water quality programs. Key provisions include creating a certification program for farmers who use practices that reduce runoff, establishing a unified water quality monitoring program, and strengthening oyster aquaculture leasing. To further advance these efforts, the Moore Administration has expanded funding for enhanced nutrient removal upgrades, provided resources to farmers and local governments, and financed innovative projects like the $200 million Piscataway Bioenergy facility serving Prince George’s and Montgomery counties.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, led over 45 Senate and House colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In their bipartisan, bicameral letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members said.

In June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction).

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal, saying it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation and manufacturing – particularly in rural communities.

Additional cosigners include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

In the House, the letter was signed by Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Derek Schmidt (R-Kan.), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Max Miller (R-Ohio), James Baird (R-Ind.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.), Mark Messmer (R-Ind.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), Mark Alford (R-Mo.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Mich.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Rudy Yakym (R-Ind.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).

Organizations endorsing the letter include the American Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Oilseed Processors Association and the National Sorghum Producers.

Grassley helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. In April, Grassley and Klobuchar urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector by raising RVO levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. The Biden-era EPA set RVOs at levels that fail to align with market conditions and production outlook, which has contributed to biodiesel plant closures in the Midwest.

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We thank the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in the Set 2 proposal and for including a 50 percent reduction in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction). The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities.

Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located. This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.

For these reasons, we urge EPA to finalize the Import RIN reduction as proposed and to hold firm on the biomass-based diesel volumes in the rule. Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.

LUBBOCK — Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

[Running Out: Texas’ water crisis — and the path forward]

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

[Data centers are thirsty for Texas’ water, but state planners don’t know how much they will need]

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there's better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

The EPA system by which companies calculate how many climate-altering emissions their facilities produce is called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).
The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for 75 percent of global carbon emissions.
The proposal that was ultimately released in September, however, would permanently remove reporting obligations for fossil gas distribution entities and suspend reporting for other oil and gas facilities until 2034.
Using Carbon Majors, a database of carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, UCS has shown that just 122 fossil fuel and cement companies are responsible for 94% of industrial carbon dioxide emissions since 1959.","The ongoing campaign by the White House to block accountability for the fossil fuel industry has hit a new low with the proposed elimination of mandatory carbon emission accounting. A look at the global business and policy landscape, however, indicates that this effort may hurt not just public health and safety, but the very companies the proposal is supposed to help.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a rule on September 12 that would eliminate requirements for measuring and reporting carbon emissions for the vast majority of US industries, including fossil fuel producers and refiners. This comes on the heels of multiple other attempts by Administrator Zeldin to relieve fossil fuel interests from climate accountability, most prominently his proposal to rescind the EPA’s 2009 finding that global-warming emissions are harmful—and thus require regulation—despite decisive scientific research showing that such emissions pose a serious threat to human health.

The EPA system by which companies calculate how many climate-altering emissions their facilities produce is called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). GHGRP had bipartisan support upon its creation by Congress in 2008, and many have come to value the data it produces. Scientists use GHGRP data to track emissions trends and determine hot spots, information crucial for informing policymakers as well as well as communities exposed to these high levels of pollution. Systematically measuring emissions allows companies to compare their numbers with those of competitors and communicate with investors and the public about their climate impacts.

When the EPA first announced its intention to reconsider GHGRP months ago, indications were that certain oil and gas facilities would still have to report emissions. The burning of fossil fuels is responsible for 75 percent of global carbon emissions. The proposal that was ultimately released in September, however, would permanently remove reporting obligations for fossil gas distribution entities and suspend reporting for other oil and gas facilities until 2034.

No reporting, no deal

The White House clearly considers the GHGRP rollback part of its plan to pump up US oil and gas production. The US exports far more gas than coal and hopes to surge exports to regions like the European Union (EU), as evidenced by the administration’s recent European medicine show, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright told leaders to roll back environmental regulations and buy more US fossil fuels.

However, killing the program may actually complicate such efforts. GHGRP data can be used to qualify companies to sell their oil and gas to countries and regions with carbon emission disclosure standards, like the EU. Though the EU is slated to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. gas after some arm-twisting by the Trump administration, the trading bloc will require exporters to disclose their emissions of the fossil fuel gas methane starting in 2027, with the goal of limiting emissions by 2030. Companies planning to use GHGRP data will now likely have to pay a third party for emissions accounting, according to industry analysts.

The short-sightedness of rolling back the GHGRP is reminiscent of the administration’s termination of several regulations requiring companies to measure and disclose climate-related financial risks. Many of the countries the US does business with have adopted such regulations, putting the US at a disadvantage. According to the Climate Policy Monitor, an initiative based at the UK’s Oxford University that tracks climate-related policies across the world, at least nine countries and regions—including Brazil, China, South Korea, and the EU—require companies to disclose the physical risks that climate change poses to their operations and business. Public procurement contracts also increasingly contain sustainability requirements, meaning “potentially huge amounts of public spending are being re-routed towards products and suppliers that align with national climate objectives,” according to the Monitor’s 2024 report. .

Studies have determined that accounting and disclosure programs like GHGRP are effective in changing corporate behavior. One study found that facilities reduced their emissions by almost 8 percent within two years of reporting under the program, spurred by benchmarking against peers and concerns about legislation. Requiring companies to measure and disclose risk-inducing externalities like global warming emissions brings other benefits to companies as well.

A Columbia University review of mandatory, quantitative, and uniform disclosures found they can lead to “increased market share for a corporation that privately anticipates the economic consequences of disclosure, benchmarks its own performance relative to its competitors, and responds to public signals from investors, consumers, and regulators.” As the old saying goes, you can’t manage what you don’t measure.

Stopping reporting won’t stop global warming

The need for companies to disclose emissions and climate-related risks is more urgent than ever. Global warming emissions continue to rise despite the proliferation of voluntary carbon-cutting pledges that financial institutions and other companies signed on to at the behest of their shareholders and consumers. Voluntary target-setting was never going to provide a lasting solution to climate change, but it often laid the groundwork for lasting regulations, which motivated many companies to take part.

Meanwhile, the costs of climate change continue to accrue. The global insurance provider Swiss Re calculated that losses from natural catastrophes like hurricanes Milton and Helene reached $318 billion in 2024 alone, and are set to increase around 6 percent annually. Science has shown that climate change makes these catastrophes more frequent and severe, and the field of attribution science is increasingly able to tie climate impacts and extreme events to specific companies’ emissions.

Using Carbon Majors, a database of carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, UCS has shown that just 122 fossil fuel and cement companies are responsible for 94% of industrial carbon dioxide emissions since 1959. Scientists are able to use the Carbon Majors database to quantify contributions of these companies to sea level rise, areas burned by wildfires, and other climate-related harms. Such research can inform dozens of lawsuits aiming to hold fossil fuel companies accountable—lawsuits that some elected officials and politicians are trying to derail by protecting companies with a liability shield.

The tragedy of energy transition delay

The Trump Administration’s anti-sustainability intimidation tactics have pushed many companies to abandon their voluntary commitments, leading groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance to suspend operations. This concerning trend led 54 groups (including the Union of Concerned Scientists) to call on central bank leaders and financial system regulators to require mandatory emissions disclosure rules and climate transition plans that prioritize financing of renewables over fossil fuels.

The initiative was sparked by the tenth anniversary of a speech by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he was governor of the Bank of England. The speech, titled “Tragedy of the Horizon,” discusses how the dangers of climate change extend beyond the political, business and financial cycles.

“We don’t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors, imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix,” Carney said. Making companies provide information about their emissions and related risks can create that incentive, however. “By managing what gets measured, we can break the Tragedy of the Horizon,” he said.

Carney emphasized that starting the energy transition early and keeping it on a predictable path is critical for minimizing risks to financial stability. Climate risk doesn’t just influence the financial system: decisions made within the financial system influence climate risk. By delaying the energy transition, the Trump Administration is exacerbating climate catastrophes while harming the economy by distorting markets. At the end of the day, that choice is bad for corporations’ bottom-lines and devastating for the billions of people around the globe who will continue to suffer greater floods, fires, and heatwaves for every degree the planet warms.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Carbon-Reduction-Icons-Dilok-KlaisatapornGetty-Images.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:47.459512

“We have the best lineup of ICE and EV vehicles we’ve ever had.","General Motors Co. in Detroit says its third quarter U.S. vehicle sales were up 8 percent from the same period a year ago on continued strength in both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

GM set another EV sales record in Q3, with 66,501 deliveries as industry-wide EV sales surged as customers took advantage of the $7,500 federal tax credit that expired Sept. 30. GM’s year to date total EV sales in the U.S. year to date now stand at 144,668, up 105 percent from a year earlier.

Chevrolet Equinox EV, according to the automaker, is the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S. Cadillac, meanwhile, has three of the 10 best-selling EVs in the luxury segment through the end of September: LYRIQ (No. 2), OPTIQ (No. 5), and VISTIQ (No. 6).

GM says it leads the industry in overall sales and continues to grow in gas-powered vehicles. GM’s crossovers and SUVs reached a new record in Q3. GMC Terrain, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse, and Buick Envista all had their best-ever third quarter sales. GM is on track to lead the full-size pickup market for the sixth straight year and to top the full-size SUV market for the 51st consecutive year.

Sales for the year’s first three quarters were up 10 percent to 2.2 million vehicles, the best pace in a decade, the automaker says

“No one is in a stronger position for a changing U.S. market than GM,” says Duncan Aldred, senior vice president of GM and president of GM North America. “We have the best lineup of ICE and EV vehicles we’ve ever had. Our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, and low incentives and inventory.”

Those credits, expanded and extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, gave drivers up to $7,500 in credits toward the purchase of a new electric vehicle. They’ve been a major force in cutting the up-front costs of EVs, pushing more people toward purchasing them and giving automakers confidence that demand would be strong.

The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. And transportation is a major contributor to US climate pollution, with cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes together making up roughly 30% of total greenhouse-gas emissions.

To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably going to be a rough end to the year.)

When you factor in fuel savings, the lifetime cost of an EV can already be lower than that of a gas-powered vehicle today. But EVs can have a higher up-front cost, which is why some governments offer a tax credit or rebate that can help boost adoption for the technology.

In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales. While the program was active, drivers could get grants of up to about €6,000 toward the purchase of a new battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.

Eventually, the government began pulling back the credits. Support for plug-in hybrids ended in 2022, and commercial buyers lost eligibility in September 2023. Then the entire program came to a screeching halt in December 2023, when the government announced it would be ending the incentives with about one week’s notice.

Monthly sales data shows the fingerprints of those changes. In each case where there’s a contraction of public support, there’s a peak in sales just before a cutback, then a crash after. These short-term effects can be dramatic: There were about half as many battery-electric vehicles sold in Germany in January 2024 than there were in December 2023.

We’re already seeing the first half of this sort of boom-bust cycle in the US: EV sales ticked up in August, making up about 10% of all new vehicle sales, and analysts say September will turn out to be a record-breaking month. People rushed to take advantage of the credits while they still could.

Next comes the crash—the next few months will probably be very slow for EVs. One analyst predicted to the Washington Post that the figure could plummet to the low single digits, “like 1 or 2%.”

Ultimately, it’s not terribly surprising that there are local effects around these policy changes. “The question is really how long this decline will last, and how slowly any recovery in the growth will be,” Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway who collects EV sales data, said in an email.

When I spoke to experts (including Andrew) for a story last year, several told me that Germany’s subsidies were ending too soon, and that they were concerned about what cutting off support early would mean for the long-term prospects of the technology in the country. And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.

EV growth did see a longer-term backslide in Germany after the end of the subsidies. Battery-electric vehicles made up 13.5% of new registrations in 2024, down from 18.5% the year before, and the UK also passed Germany to become Europe’s largest EV market.

Things have improved this year, with sales in the first half beating records set in 2023. But growth would need to pick up significantly for Germany to reach its goal of getting 15 million battery-electric vehicles registered in the country by 2030. As of January 2025, that number was just 1.65 million.

According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions. Sales of battery-electric vehicles could be about 40% lower in 2030 without the credits than what we’d see with them, according to one analysis by Princeton University’s Zero Lab.

Some US states still have their own incentive programs for people looking to buy electric vehicles. But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.

As Andrew put it: “From a climate perspective, with road transport responsible for almost a quarter of US total emissions, leaving the low-hanging fruit on the tree is a significant setback.”

This effort marks a milestone on the path to electrification, will help create more green jobs, and promote a just transition in urban logistics.

The collaboration, focused on implementing, diversifying, and scaling the use of charging hubs, will integrate companies of all sizes with electric vehicle fleets into Mexico’s most robust and reliable charging network — the VEMO Charging Network (VCN) — to reduce emissions and demonstrate that the shift to electric fleets is possible, affordable, and necessary.

Over a three-month period, two leading companies in the sector will test the charging infrastructure under real operating conditions, generating key data on operational and financial efficiency, usability, sustainability, and emissions reductions. These results will benefit the companies involved and contribute to the objectives and targets of Mexico City’s Climate Action Program. Building on the pilot’s findings, the partners aim to encourage more companies to join the electric-charging ecosystem, fostering cleaner freight fleets and replicable experiences that deliver environmental benefits in other Mexican and Latin American cities.

“This step through the Laneshift initiative represents an evolution of the joint work between VEMO and The Climate Pledge, of which we have been signatories since 2024. Our goal with this alliance is to ensure that companies with heavy-duty electric fleets have access to reliable and affordable charging infrastructure. We want to remove daily operational barriers to accelerate the transition toward cleaner, more efficient mobility,” said Constantino Rodríguez, Commercial Head at VEMO, Mexico’s leading cleantech driving the transition to clean mobility in Latin America.

The project is part of Laneshift, an initiative led by C40 and The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, which seeks to decarbonize medium- and heavy-duty freight transport and optimize routes in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico. Laneshift works with key stakeholders to reduce gaps in access to charging infrastructure and advance the decarbonization of the freight transport sector.

“This type of alliance shows how climate action can translate into concrete, ambitious solutions. This demonstration project accelerates the transition to last-mile electric fleets and contributes to Mexico City’s climate goals. At the same time, it improves air quality, creates green jobs, and expands access to charging infrastructure in cities — promoting a just and inclusive transition,” said Cristina Argudo, Interim Regional Director for Latin America at C40.

“At C40, in collaboration with The Climate Pledge, we are truly excited about this partnership with a signatory company like VEMO. This charging hub is a strategic solution to accelerate electromobility and decarbonize freight transport in the region, making a significant contribution to our objectives,” she concluded.

Sarah Dimson-Tararuj, Head of Strategic Projects and Programs at The Climate Pledge–Amazon, added: “The commitment of companies like VEMO highlights the power of cross-sector collaboration to meet the ambitious target of The Climate Pledge: net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The Laneshift initiative in Mexico City helps send clear demand signals for the development of fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the region. The project also seeks to incentivize investment and promote effective public policies that will enable the scale-up of electric vehicles in the logistics and transport sector.”

Key facts:

· Up to 1,890 tCO₂e annual emissions reduction projected, according to C40 estimates.

· Open invitation for companies of all sizes to charge their freight fleets.

· Core to Laneshift’s strategy to close infrastructure and financing gaps for freight electrification.

The transport sector consumes 45% of energy in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico and is the main source of combustion-related air pollution, according to the latest Emissions Inventory.

The US EV maker reported deliveries of 497,099, up seven percent from the year-ago level, reversing a series of declines in three straight quarters attributed partly to backlash to CEO Elon Musk’s political activism.

While the figures did not break down sales by region, automakers saw a jump in US electric vehicle sales due to the September 30 expiration of a tax credit under legislation backed by President Donald Trump.

Recent quarters have seen Tesla sales sink as the company faced blowback over Musk’s embrace of far-right political figures. Musk officially left his position with the Trump administration in May.

Tesla’s results have also been buffeted by rising competition in China from Chinese EV manufacturers and tepid demand for the Cybertruck, a futuristic stainless steel vehicle championed by the controversial CEO.

Musk has touted Tesla’s potential for great growth due to its autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology, but some analysts have expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on developing EVs at lower retail prices — long a stated goal of the company.

Tesla’s latest batch of sales figures “smashed expectations,” said a note from Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman that pointed out the “rush” of sales due to the US tax credit expiration.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” Britzman said.

– Higher prices ahead? –

Musk in July warned that Tesla faced a potentially “rough” period in terms of financial results once the tax credit expires. Trump’s sweeping fiscal package enacted in July the phaseout of a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 per vehicle.

On Wednesday, Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis were among the companies to report higher US sales in the third quarter, along with foreign brands such as Toyota, Honda and Kia that are significant players in the US market.

The third-quarter surge from the EV credit expiration is reminiscent of a sales uptick in the second quarter as consumers rushed to showrooms to beat out tariffs announced by Trump.

The annualized auto average sales rate rose to 16.4 million in September, topping expectations, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note Thursday.

But the report, which also cited a buoyant stock market as supportive of sales, predicted “eventual moderation, likely as soon as October, as EV sales normalize lower.”

Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said solid 2025 sales thus far reflect “a stronger than expected economy and auto market” during a briefing last week ahead of the sales figures.

But Smoke said automakers still face questions on how much of the tariff hit to pass on to consumers after largely absorbing the costs so far. New tariffs add around $5,500 in costs to the average imported vehicle.

Smoke said the average US consumer is likely to see a four to six percent increase in average prices by this time next year, with some models up eight percent.

Cox analysts highlighted the introduction of 2026 models as a likely opportunity to hike prices, noting that retail inventories are “relatively tight” and stand below year-ago levels.

Here’s what’s in store for you as you start your day:

Premium tax credits, work requirements, and rescission disputes are at the center of the government shutdown

First time since 2009 that an incumbent is not on the ballot for King County, Washington executive

An overview of the rules, agency documents, and notices published in the Federal Register last quarter

Premium tax credits, work requirements, and rescission disputes are at the center of the government shutdown

The federal government shut down at midnight on Oct. 1 after Congress did not pass a continuing resolution (CR) that would have kept government agencies open through Nov. 21. When that occurs, the Antideficiency Act prohibits the federal government from entering into a contract that is not fully funded. According to the Congressional Budget Office, an estimated 750,000 employees could also be furloughed. The last federal government shutdown occurred in 2018 when the government shut down for 35 days.

Today, we'll examine some of the policy disputes reportedly at the center of the funding conflict.

Republicans have said they want a clean CR, meaning a resolution extending all appropriations as Congress last passed them in March, with limited policy changes. On Sept. 19, the House passed a CR extending appropriations at current levels, apart from increased security appropriations for lawmakers, Supreme Court Justices, and executive branch officials.

Senate Democrats have advocated for changes in at least three policy areas in the next CR: premium tax credits, Medicaid work requirements, and presidential pocket rescissions.

Premium tax credits

Senate Democratic leaders said they would not vote for the appropriations bill to prevent the government from shutting down unless it halted the expiration of expanded premium tax credits (ePTCs) at the end of 2025. Some Republicans have said they are open to discussing extending the credits, but that a stopgap continuing resolution is not the right place for such a change. Other Republicans have said they believe Democrats want to provide health care coverage to people living in the U.S. without legal permission.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the premium tax credit “is a refundable credit that helps eligible individuals and families cover the premiums for their health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace.” In this context, refundable means that the credit may be used even if the individual owes no tax for the year.

The credit, in its most commonly used form, is advanceable, meaning that payments for the credit may be disbursed throughout the year, not just when individuals file their taxes. In these cases, the federal government pays the credit directly to the individual’s health insurance provider.

Congress established PTC's with the Affordable Care Act in 2010, and they first became available for tax year 2014 to filers with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL).

The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed in March 2021, created the expanded premium tax credit (ePTC) for tax years 2021 and 2022. It expanded the credit to those making more than 400% of the FPL if they couldn’t qualify for other government plans and could not otherwise purchase insurance with premiums not exceeding a certain percentage of household income. The bill also eliminated premiums for individuals and households claiming income between 100% and 150% of the FPL.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended the ePTC through the end of 2025, at which point the original ACA provisions of the tax credit will take effect.

Medicaid changes

Democrats have said they want to reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's (OBBBA) changes to Medicaid work requirements. Republicans have said they still want work requirements for “able-bodied, non-working adults.”

Medicaid work requirements are policies that require certain adult enrollees to work or participate in related activities to be eligible for Medicaid benefits. These activities may include employment, job training, education, or community service. The OBBBA, signed in 2025, created the first federally mandated Medicaid work requirements. The law requires states to implement a monthly 80-hour community engagement requirement for adults in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion group by Jan. 1, 2027. States may apply for a good-faith delay until Dec. 31, 2028. Georgia is the only state with an active state-level Medicaid work requirement, though 13 states have previously sought waivers from the federal government to implement them.

Rescission

Rescission is the process through which a president can request the cancellation of congressionally-appropriated funds. A pocket rescission is when the president requests that Congress rescind unspent funds fewer than 45 days before the funds are scheduled to expire (usually Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year). On Aug. 29, the White House announced that it was canceling $4.9 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign aid through pocket rescission.

Democrats have said that they want to make it harder to rescind funds and reverse President Trump’s use of the pocket rescission. Some Republicans have said they oppose Trump’s use of the pocket rescission and called it illegal. Others have said they agree with Trump’s announced cuts, but that they disagree with the use of the pocket rescission. A representative of the Office of Management and Budget called the pocket rescission a “lawful tool available to the executive branch to reduce unnecessary spending.”

In recent years, executive and legislative branch officials have debated the legality of pocket rescission. As recently as August, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a nonpartisan independent agency within the legislative branch, wrote that pocket rescission is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act. Officials with the executive branch Office of Management and Budget said pocket rescission is legal and said the GAO did not dispute this when presidents used the tool in the 1970s.

First time since 2009 that an incumbent is not on the ballot for King County, Washington executive

Claudia Balducci and Girmay Zahilay are running in the nonpartisan general election for King County, Washington, executive on Nov. 4, 2025.

This is the first open race for the office since 2009. Dow Constantine held the office from that 2009 election until his resignation in March 2025. The King County Council appointed Shannon Braddock interim county executive on April 1. Braddock did not run for election following her appointment.

The county executive is the chief executive officer of the county. The executive has the power to sign and veto ordinances, and appoint various county officers, commissioners, and board members.

Balducci and Zahilay advanced from the eight-candidate primary on Aug. 5. Zahilay received 44.2% of the vote, and Balducci received 29.8%. Though the position is officially nonpartisan, both Balducci and Zahilay are Democrats.

Balducci and Zahilay currently serve on the King County Council. The Cascadia Advocate's Henry Leyden writes, ""[Balducci and Zahilay] have repeatedly voiced agreement on values, principles, and policy directions. Both are emphasizing housing, public safety, and transportation as priorities in their campaigns, and both would govern as progressives. That has led many Democratic activists and nonprofit leaders to conclude that King County will be in good hands regardless of which frontrunner prevails.""

Despite these similarities, Democrats and progressive organizations have split their endorsements between the two. Notable endorsements for Balducci include Washington Auditor Pat McCarthy (D), U.S. Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D), The Seattle Times, and SEIU Local 925. Notable endorsements for Zahilay include Gov. Bob Ferguson (D), Washington Attorney General Nick Brown (D), U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D), and Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.

Balducci is a labor attorney and was elected to King County Council District 6 in 2015. Balducci’s priorities include:

Law enforcement and crime prevention

Behavioral health responses

Cost of living

Affordable Housing

Convenient and sustainable transportation

Zahilay is a business attorney and was elected to King County Council District 2 in 2019. The council unanimously appointed him chair on Jan. 14, 2025. Zahilay’s priorities include:

Public safety

Attracting employers and supporting small businesses

Labor standards and promoting a healthy workforce

The county executive serves four-year terms. The winner of this election will only serve a three-year term because of Amendment 1, which voters passed in 2022. Amendment 1 moved King County elections from odd years to even years. The winner of the county executive election in 2028 will return to serving a four-year term.

An overview of the rules, agency documents, and notices published in the Federal Register last quarter

The federal government added 19,256 pages to the Federal Register last quarter for a year-to-date total of 47,228 pages. The Federal Register hit an all-time high of 95,894 pages in 2016. The Federal Register is a daily journal of federal government activity that includes presidential documents, proposed and final rules, and public notices. It is a common measure of an administration’s regulatory activity, accounting for both regulatory and deregulatory actions.

Here’s a look at changes to the federal register from the last quarter, spanning from July 1 to Sept. 20, and how that compares to the third quarter of 2021, the first year of the Biden Administration.

The government added 6,838 documents to the Federal Register this quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, the government added 7,119 documents, bringing the year-to-date page total to 54,338.

Here’s a breakdown of the 6,838 documents added last quarter:

5,467 notices

92 presidential documents

496 proposed rules

783 final rules

During the third quarter of 2021, the government added fewer presidential documents (68), more proposed rules (517), and more final rules (864).

Agencies proposed 28 significant rules and issued 25 significant final rules this quarter. A 1993 executive order defines significant rules as those that can potentially have large effects on the economy, environment, public health, or state or local governments.

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines which rules meet this definition and are subject to its review. Significant actions may also conflict with presidential priorities or other agency rules.

As of Sept. 30, the Trump administration has issued 43 significant proposed rules, 65 significant final rules, and seven significant notices this year.",https://ballotpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/c/c0/DailyBrewMainImage.png,N,,2025-10-02 13:05:26.135026

Tesla reported quarterly vehicle deliveries up 7% over the year prior for the period ended Tuesday, the same day that a key tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles in the U.S. expired.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2025: 497,099

Total production Q3 2025: 447,450

Shares sank Thursday following the report. Tesla plans to update investors on its third-quarter financial results on Oct. 22.

The company reported 462,890 total deliveries in the third quarter of 2024. Tesla saw a decline in production this quarter compared to the 469,796 vehicles produced last year.

The Elon Musk-led company was expected to report around 447,600 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.

An independent researcher who publishes as Troy Teslike on Patreon predicted 481,000 deliveries for the quarter. Tesla distributed a company-compiled consensus on Sept. 26, which said analysts were expecting 443,079 deliveries.

The company doesn't break out sales and production by model or region. However, Tesla said it produced 435,826 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars. Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

Tesla's third quarter was hampered by a continuing sales slump in Europe driven partly by consumer backlash against Musk and his incendiary political rhetoric and activism, as well by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD, which are picking up market share.

The slowdown in Europe was partially offset in the U.S., where buyers rushed to purchase EVs ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit, which ended as part of President Donald Trump's spending bill passed in July.

Earlier this week, Ford said sales of its all-electric vehicles increased by 30.2% during the period to help it notch a fresh quarterly record of more than 30,600 units, still lagging far behind Tesla.

Tesla's stock price has been on a tear of late, jumping 40% in the third quarter and turning positive for the year following a brutal first three months of 2025. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up 14% this year, compared to the Nasdaq's 18% gain.

In the second quarter, Tesla reported 384,122 deliveries, a 14% year-over-year decline and the second straight quarterly drop.

In Tesla's energy business, the company said it deployed 12.5 GWh of its storage products, including its Megapack and new Megablock systems, which are backup batteries that store energy alongside businesses or utility-scale facilities.

Musk's xAI has been a big buyer of Tesla's battery energy storage systems in recent quarters.

Tesla's Megapacks generally store electricity produced by renewable sources, like wind turbines or solar panels, for later use. They can also store electricity produced during lower-demand periods to be used during peak hours, helping defray some of the costs.

The company said it deployed 9.6 GWh of energy storage products in the second quarter of 2025, and 6.9 GWh of energy storage products during the third quarter of last year.

The imminent end to US tax credits for the purchase of electric cars has brought car manufacturer Tesla a sales record after months of falling numbers.

Deliveries by the company led by Elon Musk rose by 7.4% year-on-year to 497,099 vehicles in the past quarter.

Analysts had expected a decline of around 5% on average.

In each of the first two quarters of the year, Tesla deliveries had fallen by around 13%.

Analysts had already assumed that some prospective buyers in the United States would buy before the $7,500 tax credit expired at the end of September.

However, the majority of them thought that sales were likely to fall nevertheless. The question now is what potentially early purchases will mean for sales in the current quarter and beyond.

Musk had already said that he was expecting some tough quarters ahead.

However, the tech billionaire has long played down the importance of car sales for the company.

The future of Tesla will lie in robotaxis and humanoid robots, Musk has claimed. However, the company is only just starting out in both areas - and is facing a lot of competition.

In total, Tesla built 447,410 cars of all models last quarter, around 4.8% fewer cars than in the previous year.

In the first quarter, the transition phase for the best-selling Model Y was seen as one reason for the decline, alongside the controversies surrounding the political activities of Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.

But even in the second quarter, with stable production of the Model Y, things did not go any better.

Tesla is facing more and more competition from other manufacturers in the electric car business - while the pioneer's model range is hardly changing, at least visually.

In addition, many buyers in the important US market are opting for vehicles with hybrid drives or combustion engines.

Tesla's futuristic-looking Cybertruck electric pickup is not a sales hit either.

In Europe, Tesla is continuing its rapid decline. According to figures from the industry association ACEA, new registrations in the European Union fell by 36.6% year-on-year to 8,220 vehicles in August.

In July, there was a drop of some 42%. Tesla's share of the EU car market has now fallen to 1.2%

Tesla has its European plant in Grünheide near Berlin. The company itself does not provide any information on results in individual regions and countries.

“What happens to North Sea energy doesn’t begin and end in Aberdeen.","Europe’s oil capital since the 1970s, Aberdeen in Scotland, had not fully recovered from the 2015-2016 price crash when the pandemic triggered another downturn five years later. Then came the war in Ukraine in 2022, the energy crisis, price spikes, and the UK government’s decision to raid the profits of UK North Sea operators with the so-called “windfall tax”, which has now increased the combined tax on oil and gas firms to a massive 78%.

Aberdeen and the surrounding Aberdeenshire area have been losing oil and gas jobs since the 2010s, but lately, pessimism has increased among companies in the region as Aberdeen’s fortunes have been closely tied to the energy sector’s prosperity.

The UK government says it seeks a Just Transition for the North Sea workers, but while some are transferring to renewable energy jobs, many others are quitting the energy sector altogether or moving out of Scotland and into lower-tax jurisdictions such as the top OPEC producers in the Persian Gulf.

“The delay in investment in renewables is leading to a number of skilled workers moving away,” Chris Comfort, partner at Aberdeen–based property and legal firm Aberdein Considine, told the Financial Times.

Since the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), or the windfall tax, was initially introduced by the Conservative government at the height of the energy crisis in 2022, oil and gas companies operating in the UK North Sea have been calling for certainty in the regulatory and tax framework. Recent changes in policies and the rising taxes imposed by the current Labour government have driven away operators, who say that a lack of North Sea investments would only make the UK more dependent on oil and gas imports.

Late last year, Labour also removed the 29% investment allowance on oil and gas operations, further stifling investment in the UK North Sea.

The main offshore energy industries association, OEUK, says the frequent changes in the UK tax regime, uncertainty about said taxation going forward, and the plans to ban new field development have been bigger hurdles to boosting domestic oil and gas production and reducing import dependence than the fact that the North Sea is one of the world’s most mature and developed oil and gas basins.

The government has launched a consultation on what type of tax regime should come next, and is being urged to replace the windfall tax as soon as practicable – and not wait until 2030 – to avoid the demise of the UK oil and gas industry.

“We need pragmatic action before it’s too late. We’re seeing jobs and money leave the UK at unacceptable levels,” OEUK chief executive David Whitehouse wrote in a letter to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier this week.

“What happens to North Sea energy doesn’t begin and end in Aberdeen. It ripples through our industrial spine, across sectors and into Grangemouth, Humberside, Teesside, Tyneside, East Anglia and the North West. It undermines the homegrown manufacture of things like fuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as our energy future.”

What happens in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire is that Aberdeen City and neighboring Aberdeenshire will continue to struggle, EY said in a report at the end of 2024. Aberdeen has lost nearly 18,000 jobs since 2010, equivalent to 10% of its workforce in 2010, largely due to the ongoing decline in the local oil and gas industry, the consultancy said.

“Aberdeen’s prospects remain heavily tied to the energy sector” with growth predicted to be below the Scottish average between 2024 and 2029, EY reckons.

Business confidence in the Northeast is at some of its lowest levels since the pandemic, as a sharp downturn in North Sea activity – a direct result of the increased tax on oil and gas operators to 78% – is damaging the wider economy in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, according to the Q2 North-east Quarterly Economic Survey run by?Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce in partnership with law firm?Gilson Gray LLP.

“The UK economy cannot afford to turn its back on the North Sea – nor on the thousands of businesses in this region that depend on it,” said Russell?Borthwick, Chief Executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce.

Findlay Anderson, Partner at Gilson Gray LLP, commented, “The Energy Profits Levy, coupled with increased employment costs and policy volatility, is creating an environment where firms feel unable to plan ahead.”

The announcement comes within 48 hours of federal tax credits expiring.
“Come January 1, the state tax credit will go down to $750 as a base tax credit, the extra $2,500 for lower cost vehicles will remain so up to $3,250 through the state tax credit.
Toor had mentioned to Denver7 months ago, the state was working on a solution to federal tax credits expiring.
We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,” Toors said.","DENVER — The State of Colorado is announcing a new electric vehicle rebate within two days of federal tax credits expiring under the new federal tax and spending plan.

Starting on November 3, the Vehicle Exchange Colorado rebates will increase from $6,000 to $9,000 for new EV purchase and leases and $4,000 to $6,000 for used EV purchases and leases.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said this program is designed specifically to help lower-income Coloradans.

“For people who make up to 80% of area median income, who are turning in an older polluting gasoline vehicle, will be able to get up to a $9,000 rebate towards a new electric vehicle, that's up from $6,000 which is the current level, or up to $6,000 for used electric vehicle, which is an increase from the current level of $4,000,” Toor said.

The energy office said the program launched in summer 2023 and more than 2,700 Coloradans have traded in a qualified old or high-emitting vehicle to purchase or lease an EV.

The announcement comes within 48 hours of federal tax credits expiring. Changes to state tax credits are also on the horizon.

“Come January 1, the state tax credit will go down to $750 as a base tax credit, the extra $2,500 for lower cost vehicles will remain so up to $3,250 through the state tax credit. We anticipate New Vehicle Change Colorado rebate amounts remaining as we go into the new year,” said Toor.

The new rebate is in state plans through 2032, but could be adjusted depending on the EV market, the landscape with tax credits and demand.

Toor had mentioned to Denver7 months ago, the state was working on a solution to federal tax credits expiring. He said they were able to find money from the transportation electrification enterprises funded by fee revenues that by law has to go to transportation electrification programs. Toor said as the state goes through a budget shortfall, the rebates do not rely on general fund money.

“It’s an existing program that had an existing budget, and we had a bit of room in the budget. We were able to sort of make this pivot to increase the rebates for Vehicle Exchange Colorado. There's obviously a tougher challenge when it comes to addressing the much broader population of everybody who wants an electric vehicle. We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,” Toors said.

In the meantime, the state hopes people will take advantage of the larger state credits before they expire at the end of the year.

In a statement Governor Polis wrote:

“The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay. Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost. I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: get out there right now.”

“For light duty vehicles in the U.S., we see roughly 60 to 68% lower emissions from electric vehicles versus gas powered vehicles,” Ed Piersa, with the energy office, added. “So this is all the more reason all of the goals that will pointed out are extremely important to the state.""

State leaders said to date, there are more than 200,000 EVs registered in Colorado and that EVs made up a quarter of new car sales so far in 2025.

They hope the new rebate will help keep the momentum up of reaching nearly a million EVs on Colorado roads by 2030.

If you would like to take advantage of the new rebates come November 3, Piersa said there are a few steps you need to follow.

“It's applied at the time of the transaction, and vehicle exchange Colorado participant needs to be approved by the program prior to going to an authorized automobile dealer.

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months.","Tesla’s third-quarter deliveries trounced Wall Street estimates on Thursday after several quarters of weak performance, powered by an unusual sales boost from US electric vehicle buyers rushing to lock in popular tax credits before they expire at the end of September.

Tesla said it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier. It also delivered 481,166 units of its Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y crossover in the September quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on 22 October.

Full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be about 1.61m, roughly 10% below 2024, according to investment research firm Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

Elon Musk’s carmaker had frequently talked up the expiry, using it alongside discounts and financing deals to spur sales and leases of its electric vehicles. However, worries over cooling sales in the upcoming quarters due to the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit weighed on the company’s shares, which fell in morning trading.

“While the third quarter was strong, we expect fourth quarter sales will see a decline, consistent with the first half of the year, largely due to the US tax credit expiration,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

Tesla had reported declining delivery numbers in recent quarters as it failed to refresh an ageing lineup of vehicles and suffered global backlash against Musk’s heavy involvement in politics. The company’s newest model, the Cybertruck, has not succeeded in significantly boosting sales.

Europe remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining ground in the extremely competitive market. Tesla’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

In China, Tesla began delivering the long-wheelbase, six-seat Model Y L in September, a family-focused variant that was expected to spur demand in the world’s largest EV market. Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The stripped-down version is designed to be roughly 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the US by 2026.

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500bn mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

As of last close, shares of the company were up nearly 14% this year.

While the rest of the world is still pushing forward with electric vehicles, the U.S. governemnt has done away with one of the biggest driving forces here: the EV tax credit. That means that the tech will soon need to thrive on its own merit—the biggest barrier, of course, being cost.

Car companies are working on this, though. They know that EVs need to be cheaper, especially now that Uncle Sam's wallet is officially closed. But U.S. automakers may be catching up to the production costs that seasoned Chinese automakers are paying to build comparable cars in North America.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Tesla's Q3 could be its saving grace for 2025 and a new startup is helping to slash the cost of LFP batteries. Let's jump in.

30%: Ford Says Its $30,000 EV Pickup Will Match BYD's Production Costs

Ford CEO Jim Farley just had a huge, chest-thumping moment for America's EV industry on TV. According to Farley, the automaker's new Universal EV Platform can match the production costs of BYD's made-in-Mexico EVs.

This isn't the first time that Ford has talked up its ability to take on China with new EV underpinnings. In fact, the Universal EV Platform was a direct response to China's ability to build uber-cheap EVs and sell them around the world, effectively undercutting the global auto market with reckless abandon. And it's also Ford's secret weapon in launching its $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

Here's the snippet from Farley's interview with CNBC's Squawk Box:

We just launched the universal electric vehicle platform in Louisville. We think it's the same cost as a BYD made in Mexico. We're trying to out-innovate our competitors like BYD.

I don't think we can stand still. We can't rely on a North America or US-only market. Companies like Ford have to out-innovate our Chinese competitors. We're already facing them in in Australia, New Zealand, in Thailand. They're subsidized vehicles. It's happening already.

Farley is essentially declaring war on the auto industry's boogeyman by targeting the holy grail target of affordability: $30,000. There's no tax credit helping with that number any longer, either. Washington has officially pulled that plug, but that doesn't change the needs of the consumer.

Farley noted that half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imports. And even those manufactured domestically have a significant number of imported parts (between 20% and 30% of Ford's parts are imported, according to the CEO). Meanwhile, vehicles manufactured in China often enjoy $5,000 to $6,000 advantages in labor costs and subsidies, which makes it difficult for American manufacturers to compete—and that's the reason why Ford needs to innovate.

BYD has managed to dominate the global EV market by using its home-turf government-subsidized advantage to offset labor and parts costs. But as BYD begins to move manufacturing into other countries, its costs rise. And this is where Ford recognizes as a prime place to strike.

""We have to face this,"" said Farley. ""What Ford is doing about it—we're not complaining. We're going to take care of this ourselves.""

60%: Tesla's Q3 Is Good, But Don't Call It A Comeback (Yet)

Photo by: Tesla

Tesla's third-quarter results are in, and like other automakers, it saw a surge of buyers trying to secure tax credits while they could. Tesla sold nearly half a million EVs globally in Q3, a new record.

But before anyone declares this a victory lap, it's important to know that Tesla's expected success doesn't mean it's out of the woods after a protracted period of dipping sales. Here's what Reuters reports:

The quarterly tally will help gauge how far U.S. subsidies lifted sales, as China leans on Tesla's expanded six-seater Model Y L launched in September while Europe slumped after the electric-vehicle maker's aging lineup struggled to compete and CEO Elon Musk's politics dampened buyer sentiment.

That has set the stage for weaker third-quarter global deliveries than last year and a potential drop in the December quarter. The expiry of U.S. tax credits likely accelerated purchases that normally would have been made later in the year, rather than attracting new buyers to the brand, analysts said.

Tesla raised car-leasing prices in the U.S., its website showed, after a sweeping legislation passed by Congress ended tax incentives for the EV industry on Tuesday.

Tesla isn't alone at the edge of the cliff. The whole EV sector is running on the fumes of the federal tax credit for years, and while that's done a lot of good for EV adoption in recent years, the next few months are set to be particularly rough.

But where Tesla (like other EV-only brands) is uniquely exposed is its inability to pivot to other powertrains to offset any EV-related losses. Legacy automakers like GM and Ford are pivoting to hybrids while other players like Toyota never left them.

That means that Tesla is faced with deciding what to do next. It could weather the storm in hopes that sales will pick back up in the U.S. without the EV tax credit—something it expected after acknowledging that it's in for ""a few rough quarters."" But margins are becoming thinner and competition is heating up, so maybe Tesla could pull an insane move and do something other than build cars in hopes that it will be more profitable.

Meanwhile, Q3 is going to look like a win. Tesla will finally have a good few months on its books, as will most automakers that benefited from the tax credit, but the real test comes in Q4.

90%: This U.S. Startup Says It Can Beat China's Pricing For EV Batteries

Photo by: CATL

Every single big league automaker on Earth is trying to reduce the costs of its vehicles right now. While today's driving factor is the EV tax credit, the ultimate underlying reasoning is simple. Cheaper components mean more margin, and more margin means more profits. The hard part is actually figuring out how to squeeze costs down even further on the most expensive component in an EV: the battery.

A new company called Electroflow believes that it has figured out how to do this. Not only does the startup say its tech will lead to batteries 40% cheaper to produce than leading Chinese firms, but it believes it can do that with a U.S.-based supply chain.

TechCrunch's interview with the company's co-founder shows what Electroflow has up its sleeve:

“We think LFP is the missing ingredient for energy prosperity. The problem is it’s literally 99% made in China,” Eric McShane, co-founder and CEO of Electroflow, told TechCrunch. “If we want to have a chance of competing, we’ve got to flip that script.”

McShane and his co-founder, Evan Gardner, have developed a technology they think is capable of undercutting Chinese producers on cost by removing several steps in the production process. If they can deliver, they could reduce the cost of an LPF battery by as much as 20% while building a domestic supply chain.

“We looked at the whole process of mining, starting from the rock or the salt water and getting all the way to a lithium chemical. We were like, man, that’s like ten steps,” he said. “That clearly is not the best way to do it.”

The golden standard of lithium refining starts by extracting salty brines from deep underground. The brines are then processed to extricate the lithium contained within, but that process can be lengthy and expensive. Until now, maybe.

China is able to extract and package lithium into the materials needed to build LFP battery packs for around $4,000 per metric ton today. The same amount of that material costs about three times that amount in the U.S.

Electroflow says that its process reduces processing from ten key steps down to just three. And once its process is in full swing, it will be able to get that cost down to around $2,500 per metric ton—about 40% less than China's cost today. In the near term, it expects to reach around $5,000 by the end of the year, which doesn't quite beat out China, but is still a reduction of nearly 60% for domestic production.

TechCrunch explains how Electroflow's tech works:

The startup’s key technology is a cell that contains anodes that, when run in one direction, absorb lithium ions from brines and then, in another, release them into water containing carbonates. When both passes are finished, the result is lithium carbonate that’s ready to be reacted with phosphate, iron, and other reagents to produce LFP powder that’s ready to be shipped to a battery factory. For manufacturers that want to make something other than LFP, Electroflow can stop the process early and just send them lithium carbonate.

The system runs entirely on electricity, and producing 50 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year would require only as much as one U.S. household, McShane said. The water used in the carbonate step can largely be recycled, too. “We don’t use a ton of electricity. We don’t use a ton of water,” he said.

McShane says that a refining system capable of generating around 100 metric tons of processed powder—around $2,500,000 of LFP material—can fit inside a standard 20-foot shipping container.

The tech is definitely the moonshot that the U.S. EV market needs to build cheaper EVs. Electroflow believes in it, and it completed a proof-of-concept in California earlier this year to demonstrate as much. And if it catches on, it could help drive down the cost of EVs in the coming years, especially as automakers domesticate more of the supply chain.

100%: Are Hybrids In For A Few Good Years Ahead?

While automakers prepare for EVs to have another resurgence, many are going all-in on hybrids to bridge the gap. In fact, Americans were more interested in hybrids than ever at the start of 2025, a trend that many manufacturers are banking on being a way to still utilize their investment into domestic battery manufacturing despite an anticipated slowdown in EV sales.

Tesla reported higher global third-quarter auto deliveries on Thursday, joining a broad slate of automakers seeing a surge in electric vehicles ahead of the phaseout of a US tax credit.

The US EV maker reported deliveries of 497,099, up seven percent from the year-ago level, reversing a series of declines in three straight quarters attributed partly to backlash to CEO Elon Musk’s political activism.

While the figures did not break down sales by region, automakers saw a jump in US electric vehicle sales due to the September 30 expiration of a tax credit under legislation backed by President Donald Trump.

Recent quarters have seen Tesla sales sink as the company faced blowback over Musk’s embrace of far-right political figures. Musk officially left his position with the Trump administration in May.

Tesla’s results have also been buffeted by rising competition in China from Chinese EV manufacturers and tepid demand for the Cybertruck, a futuristic stainless steel vehicle championed by the controversial CEO.

Musk has touted Tesla’s potential for great growth due to its autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology, but some analysts have expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on developing EVs at lower retail prices — long a stated goal of the company.

Tesla’s latest batch of sales figures “smashed expectations,” said a note from Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman that pointed out the “rush” of sales due to the US tax credit expiration.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” Britzman said.

– Higher prices ahead? –

Musk in July warned that Tesla faced a potentially “rough” period in terms of financial results once the tax credit expires. Trump’s sweeping fiscal package enacted in July the phaseout of a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 per vehicle.

On Wednesday, Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis were among the companies to report higher US sales in the third quarter, along with foreign brands such as Toyota, Honda and Kia that are significant players in the US market.

The third-quarter surge from the EV credit expiration is reminiscent of a sales uptick in the second quarter as consumers rushed to showrooms to beat out tariffs announced by Trump.

The annualized auto average sales rate rose to 16.4 million in September, topping expectations, JPMorgan Chase analysts said in a note Thursday.

But the report, which also cited a buoyant stock market as supportive of sales, predicted “eventual moderation, likely as soon as October, as EV sales normalize lower.”

Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said solid 2025 sales thus far reflect “a stronger than expected economy and auto market” during a briefing last week ahead of the sales figures.

But Smoke said automakers still face questions on how much of the tariff hit to pass on to consumers after largely absorbing the costs so far. New tariffs add around $5,500 in costs to the average imported vehicle.

Smoke said the average US consumer is likely to see a four to six percent increase in average prices by this time next year, with some models up eight percent.

Cox analysts highlighted the introduction of 2026 models as a likely opportunity to hike prices, noting that retail inventories are “relatively tight” and stand below year-ago levels.",https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20190720_132748-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 13:09:50.432330

France could become a global leader in the offshore wind sector if plans move forward","France has completed the sale of one of the most important offshore wind projects that will set the wind tariff at €66/MWh. France is among the most advanced nations in the world in the energy sector and has, for the past decade, been implementing measures to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a more environmentally friendly form of energy generation. The offshore wind project in Normandy, known as the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender, has been sold to a consortium of companies.

France approves the sale of the offshore wind project in a very famous city

Normandy is known around the world as the last stand for the world against the worst form of tyranny we have ever seen; however, since then, the region around Normandy has become a hotbed for the energy sector.

A massive offshore wind project in the region has been sold to a consortium of companies, including one of the largest energy companies in the world, TotalEnergies. Additionally, RWE will also form a part of the deal to acquire the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender, although the company has stated its plans to exit the consortium, but we digress.

The 1.5 GW offshore wind park off the coast of Normandy will see the consortium taking full advantage of TotalEnergies’ expertise in the field and will design, develop, construct, and operate the wind farm. Additionally, TotalEnergies made a statement on its website that outlines its plans to engage with the local community.

“In the coming months, a dedicated TotalEnergies team, based in Normandy, will continue the consultation work with local and regional stakeholders that began during the tender phase. It will ensure the proper integration of the project into the Normandy region, especially its coexistence with commercial fishing. TotalEnergies will also implement crowdfunding financing that will allow local residents and authorities in the Normandy region to invest in the project and directly contribute to the energy transition of their territory. Additionally, TotalEnergies will fund a €10 million territorial fund to support initiatives in training, education, and culture in Normandy.” – TotalEnergies press release

TotalEnergies aims to make a final investment decision (FID) in early 2029

Once that happens, the company has stated that it estimates the total investment at €4.5 billion, with a state-set tariff of €66/MWh. The country’s second National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which was published in 2024, noted a target of 41.3% renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2030.

By that time, the offshore wind capacity is projected to reach 3.6 GW. The evidence would suggest, despite the current state of affairs in the United States, that wind power usage will continue to grow.

Following the sale, the heads of TotalEnergies released a statement that outlines their plans for the site.

“We are very proud to have won this tender for the construction of the largest renewable energy park in France to date. It embodies Total’s transformation into TotalEnergies in France. This project will be the largest investment made by TotalEnergies in France in decades and reflects our Company’s deep commitment to our country. As a long-standing player in Normandy, we are determined to mobilize our expertise to ensure this project is an industrial success while securing its acceptance by the region. We will work to support the local industrial ecosystem, which has already developed skills through the first offshore wind projects currently being installed. Finally, this project strengthens our development in green electricity production to offer competitive prices to our French customers”, – Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

The U.S. energy storage market set a record for quarterly growth in the second quarter of 2025, with 5.6 GW of installations, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report released today by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

The utility-scale market led the way, setting a record with 4.9 GW installed, enough capacity to power 3.7 million American homes during average peak load demand.

The residential storage market expanded 608 M. This represents a 132 percent increase year-over-year and an 8 percent jump quarter-over-quarter.

Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona and Illinois,

Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets and continued investment tax credit access through third-party ownership.""

Wood Mackenzie projects that these record levels of additional storage capacity will continue into the foreseeable future.

Renewable Energy Jobs grew 3X faster in 2024

Renewable energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024. However, future growth could be in jeopardy, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report released by E2.

The report showed that the renewable energy sector added almost 100,000 new jobs, bringing the total number of renewable energy workers in the United States to 3.56 million. However, policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024 led to the growth in renewable energy jobs dropping to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

More than 7 percent of all new jobs added in the United States and 82 percent of all new energy jobs added last year were in renewable energy occupations.

According to E2, since January 2025, companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Global Solar Installations surge 64 percent so far in 2025

While the US is facing increased policy headwinds to the expansion of solar, the rest of the world is setting new capacity records.

China led the pack in solar installations, adding 256 GW so far this year– more than twice as much (67 percent) solar capacity as the rest of the world combined.

India came in second behind China, installing 24 GW, while the U.S. placed third, installing about 21 GWWorldwide, 380 GW of new solar capacity was installed in the first half of this year, marking a 64 percent increase from 2024, when 232 GW was installed in the same timeframe, according to a report from the clean energy think tank Ember.

""In 2024, global solar output rose by 28 percent (+469 TWh) compared to 2023.

Fracking's Broken Promise

In 2013, when the Appalachian fracking rush was still in its early days, then President Barack Obama extolled its benefits in his State of the Union address. Along with the economic benefits of extraction and insulating the nation from the dangers of relying on foreign sources of energy - he noted that ""Nearly everyone's energy bill will be lower because of it.""

And there was indeed a growth in supply. Natural gas production in Pennsylvania more than doubled between 2013 and 2024. The state went all in on natural gas, transitioning its grid to rely on gas for 60 percent of the state's electricity.

But these shifts have not translated to lower electric costs for Pennsylvanians. Comparing average household electricity prices from 2010 to 2024, residents have seen their bills increase dramatically.

After a period of relative stability, Pennsylvania electricity rates have soared since 2020. The average household electricity bill in the state has risen 31 percent in the past five years. Utilities are projecting another 5 percent increase over the next 6 months.

The Elon-Musk-led carmaker had frequently talked up the expiration, using it alongside discounts and financing deals to spur sales and leases of its EVs.

However, worries over cooling sales in the upcoming quarters due to the withdrawal of the $7,500 federal tax credit weighed on the company’s shares, which fell nearly 1% in morning trading.

“While the third quarter was strong, we expect fourth quarter sales will see a decline, consistent with the first half of the year, largely due to the US tax credit expiration,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.

Europe remained a weak spot as rivals aggressively promoted plug-in hybrids, while Chinese EV brands started gaining groundin the hyper-competitive market.

The company’s European sales, including the UK, fell 22.5% from a year earlier in August, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the region’s Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

Overall, Tesla said it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, up 7.4% from 462,890 a year earlier.

It also delivered 481,166 units of its Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y crossover in the September quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. The carmaker is set to report quarterly results on October 22.

Full-year 2025 deliveries are projected to be around 1.61 million, roughly 10% below 2024, according to Visible Alpha. Tesla will need to deliver 389,498 vehicles in the December quarter to meet that projection.

In China, Tesla began delivering the long-wheelbase, six-seat Model Y L in September, a family-focused variant that was expected to spur demand in the world’s largest EV market.

Meanwhile, Rivian on Thursday lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast, but beat estimates for quarterly deliveries owing to a boost in demand from buyers rushing to take advantage of tax credits.

Musk and Tesla

Tesla holdings account for the bulk of Musk’s wealth and a recent surge in the company’s stock price helped his net worth breach the $500 billion mark on Wednesday, bolstering his position as the world’s richest person.

As of last close, shares of the company were up nearly 14% this year.

The company’s board has proposed a shareholder vote on a new CEO award that could grant Musk about 12% of the company, worth up to $1 trillion, if performance and valuation targets are met.

The billionaire has tried to position Tesla more as a technology company by focusing on AI-based self-driving systems, robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Cheaper models

Tesla has delayed rolling out the lower-cost Model Y in the US, pushing the timing by several months, with an eventual plan to build the variant in China and Europe.

Analysts said Tesla’s ability to cushion a post-credit slowdown will depend heavily on its push into lower-priced models.

“The challenge now is dealing with the potential slowdown that follows, and that’s where a new, more affordable model becomes crucial to keeping momentum going,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.

The sales figures put Tesla on pace with other automakers. General Motors and Ford said on Wednesday that their sales increased by 8% in the third quarter after record numbers of EVs were sold.

The news comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk became the first person whose net worth hit $500 billion this week, indicating his EV company is performing well despite financial troubles earlier this year.

The previous two quarters were characterized by steep declines, fueled by Musk’s brief time in the White House and his association with President Donald Trump. The billionaire’s right-wing views prompted a number of protesters to vandalize Tesla cars and dealerships.

Musk ultimately cut ties with the Trump administration to focus on his businesses, including Tesla. It appears his strategy is working so far, although the automaker’s increased sales may not last very long.

Because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed the tax credits on Tuesday, EV sales are expected to drop in the next few quarters. The Congressional Research Service estimates a 25% to 30% decline.

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.
The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon.
Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.
For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.","Louisiana’s industrial giants could net more than $3.5 billion in federal tax credits if their carbon capture and sequestration projects move forward as planned.

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.

According to project data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, at least 17 announced projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquified natural gas sectors would qualify under the “industry and power” and “direct air capture” category of the credit.

In total, those 17 projects are estimating that some 42 million tons of carbon dioxide would be captured, either for storage or to be reused in other industrial projects.

The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon. Twenty-two of the projects listed include regional “hubs,” an infrastructural network that “takes carbon dioxide from several emitting sources, such as heavy industries and power, and then transports and stores it using common infrastructure,” according to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.

The 45Q incentive applies once a qualifying project either locks captured carbon underground in approved geological sites – such as saline formations or depleted oil and gas reservoirs – or puts the carbon to work as an input for making low-carbon fuels, chemicals, or construction materials.

The 45Q credit was strengthened in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and reaffirmed this summer in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump. Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.

Some of the largest projects carry the biggest potential payouts.

For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.

For the Air Products Darrow Blue Energy Facility in Ascension Parish and the St. Rose Blue Ammonia Facility in St. Charles Parish, each could receive about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex in Cameron Parish would be eligible for roughly $340 million per year.

Several other ammonia, methanol, and LNG facilities – including Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex, Cameron LNG Facility, and CF Industries/Mitsui Gulf Coast Blue Ammonia Plant – would qualify for between $85 million and $170 million annually.

Several other ventures, such as Commonwealth LNG, Big Lake Fuels, and Methanex Geismar Methanol, have not disclosed projected capture volumes, meaning the ultimate credit tally could climb even higher, according to the Project.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/4.-Depositphotos_cash-money.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:08:11.607286

Crypto mining companies are actively negotiating contracts with Brazilian electricity providers, such as Renova Energia, that would benefit from the South American country's surplus renewable power without burdening the grid during peak times. A report from Reuters details the negotiations.

Following crypto heavyweight Tether, which announced in July an investment in the South American country, there are at least six negotiations for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as one for a larger project of up to 400 megawatts (MW), people from six different companies told Reuters.

Mining machines that solve complex mathematical problems to back crypto transactions have overloaded grids in multiple countries. However, in Brazil, where crypto mining hardly exists today, they could help address a chronic clean electricity oversupply problem, which has cost energy companies almost $1 billion in the last two years, according to wind and solar industry groups ABEEolica and Absolar.

Tether, the world's largest digital assets company, said it is leveraging its recent acquisition of Adecoagro to tap its renewable energy, such as the electricity coming from sugarcane mills, to power a bitcoin mining operation in Brazil.

Renewable energy supplier Renova told Reuters it is making one of the first major investments in the crypto sector, a $200 million mining project for an undisclosed client in the state of Bahia in the northeast of Brazil. The 100-MW venture consists of six data centers that will draw power from a wind farm.

""We aim to expand the company and enter new markets,"" Renova CEO Sergio Brasil said. ""We realized that by providing all the infrastructure (for crypto mining), we were one step ahead of our competitors.""

Crypto miners can rapidly scale operations up or down based on energy availability, providing a flexible consumer base for excess energy without straining the grid during peak demand periods.

Brazil's energy oversupply stems from years of government incentives that spurred a boom in wind and solar investments. But the pace of development has outstripped the expansion of transmission infrastructure, and some plants now waste as much as 70% of the power they generate.

Held under the theme “Unlocking a Clean Energy Economy,” the week-long event from October 2 brings together stakeholders to discuss policy solutions and foster partnerships.

It focuses on critical issues in the country’s clean energy transition, such as developing clean energy skills and advancing women’s economic empowerment through a just energy transition.

Hem Vanndy, Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, applauded the summit for bringing stakeholders together in a way that goes beyond dialogue to drive practical action and measurable impact.

“The summit’s theme sends a strong message, emphasizing that clean energy goals are not only about protecting the environment but represent a strategic pathway to safeguard our economy and secure Cambodia’s position in the global market,” Vanndy said.

“Clean energy is no longer just an option, it is a necessity. It holds the key to shaping our next chapter of growth, one defined not by how much we produce, but by how wisely and sustainably we create and use our resources.”

Australian Ambassador Derek Yip commended Cambodia’s progress in expanding access to electricity and exploring renewable energy options.

He noted that the country’s ambitious target of 70 percent renewable energy by 2030 provides a roadmap for building a sustainable and resilient economy.

“Through effective clean energy policies, Cambodia can bolster its growth by enhancing energy reliability, reducing costs, and drawing in responsible investments. These efforts will not only help tackle climate change but also provide access to international markets that are becoming more climate-conscious,” Yip said.

Natharoun Ngo Son, regional director for Energy & Economy at EnergyLab Asia, also praised Cambodia, not only as a major producer of renewable energy for local use but also for its clean energy target.

He is optimistic that a clean energy economy can deliver more jobs, more revenue, enhanced competitiveness and market access, while attracting quality foreign direct investments.

The summit is organized by EnergyLab Cambodia, in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and in collaboration with co-founders, Australia and the United Nations Development Programme.

It aims to foster deep collaboration between development partners, government policymakers and the private sector while raising awareness of clean energy among a wider local audience.

The event will show how clean energy strengthens key industries, including garment production and tourism, while attracting investment in energy-intensive and clean technology sectors.

Achieving the clean energy transition

Acknowledging the importance of human resources, Vanndy said the country must invest in people as much as in technology. Engineers, technicians and energy managers were the backbone of the clean energy transition.

“We must also empower them with our collective commitment and contribution to research and development that will open new frontiers and possibilities. Additionally, we need strong public–private partnerships in which every stakeholder coordinates and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem.”

Enrico Gaveglia, UNDP Resident Representative, noted that Cambodia has abundant solar resources, a young workforce and robust regional networks.

He expressed optimism that the country can leapfrog into a clean energy future with the right policies and investments, while pledging UNDP’s support for the journey.

Recognizing Cambodia’s vision of graduating from Least Developed Country status by 2029, Gaveglia said the key challenge is sustaining progress while building resilience in a changing global economy.

He said energy lies at the heart of this challenge. While it drives emissions, it also holds the key to resilience, affordability, and energy security.

However, without universal access to clean, efficient, affordable and inclusive energy, he said Cambodia cannot achieve its development goals.

“Therefore, this national urgency echoes a global call. The UN Secretary-General reminds us that we must triple renewable capacity, double energy efficiency, and achieve universal access to clean energy by 2030,” Gaveglia said.

At the same time, Son advised that, since Cambodia is still in the early stages of unlocking its clean energy economy, it should prioritize three pillars to maximize its potential.

“The first pillar focuses on the nation’s electricity system transition to clean energy, including all the investments into efficient generation, transmission, and distribution technology, to make the transition safe and secure,” Son said.

“The second pillar leverages this clean energy system to accelerate the growth of existing industries and support the emergence of new ones. Cambodia can help investors meet international market requirements for low or zero-carbon products, using clean energy as a key market differentiator.”

He added that Cambodia could benefit by carving out a share of the rapidly growing clean energy manufacturing sector, including producing EVs, solar and wind technologies, battery energy storage systems, and other clean energy equipment.",https://img.cambodianess.com/uploads/article/10-2025/1759403109.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 14:03:20.360322

The electric-vehicle giant delivered 497,000 vehicles globally in the quarter ended Sept. 30, marking a 7% increase from the same period a year earlier and a significant rebound from earlier softness in demand. This performance, fueled by a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to secure a $7,500 federal tax credit before its expiration, underscores how policy shifts can dramatically influence market dynamics in the competitive EV sector.

Analysts had anticipated deliveries around 441,000 to 475,000 units, but the actual figure shattered those projections, driven largely by accelerated purchases in the U.S. market. Tesla’s production also ramped up to 495,000 vehicles, with strong contributions from its factories in the U.S. and China, even as European sales faced headwinds from economic slowdowns and increased competition from local manufacturers.

Tax Credit Expiration Drives Unprecedented Demand Surge

The impending end of the Inflation Reduction Act’s EV tax credit on Sept. 30 appears to have created a buying frenzy, with consumers pulling forward purchases to qualify for the incentive. According to a report from Yahoo Finance, this policy deadline “juiced sales,” leading to what the publication described as “blowout” results. Tesla’s U.S. deliveries hit record levels, offsetting weaker performance in regions like Europe, where regulatory changes and subsidy reductions have dampened enthusiasm for battery-powered cars.

Industry observers note that while the tax credit’s lapse provided a short-term boost, it may lead to a demand hangover in the fourth quarter. Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, from users like market analysts echoed this sentiment, with one highlighting estimates surging to 475,000 units ahead of the deadline due to “strong U.S. demand ahead of the IRA tax credit phase-out.” Such social media buzz reflected growing optimism among investors, contributing to a rebound in Tesla’s stock price in recent weeks.

Production Ramp-Up and Global Market Challenges

Tesla’s ability to scale production amid this demand spike demonstrates its operational agility, with energy storage deployments also reaching 12.5 gigawatt-hours in the quarter—a metric that points to expanding revenue streams beyond vehicles. However, the company faces ongoing challenges, including intensified competition from rivals like BYD Co. in China and legacy automakers ramping up their EV offerings in the U.S.

A piece from CNBC emphasized that the tax credit’s expiration “got a boost as some consumers rush to buy electric vehicles,” aligning with Tesla’s strategy of offering incentives like discounted leases to maintain momentum. Yet, as noted in reports from Reuters, Tesla has already hiked lease prices post-expiration, signaling potential pricing power but also risks of alienating price-sensitive buyers in a post-subsidy environment.

Investor Reactions and Future Implications

Wall Street reacted positively to the delivery beat, with Tesla shares climbing in after-hours trading, validating earlier predictions from firms like UBS, which had raised forecasts citing the tax credit’s impact. This quarterly win comes at a pivotal time for Tesla, as it navigates broader industry headwinds such as supply-chain constraints and fluctuating raw material costs for batteries.

Looking ahead, analysts from Business Insider warn that the pull-forward effect could result in softer Q4 numbers, potentially missing the company’s ambitious 2 million annual delivery goal for 2025—with year-to-date figures at around 1.2 million. X posts from financial commentators, including those tracking stock movements, suggested a “monster Q3” driven by the credit’s end and new model launches in China, but cautioned about a possible demand dip. For Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this quarter reinforces the company’s resilience, yet it also highlights the vulnerability of EV adoption to policy whims, prompting questions about sustainable growth without incentives.

Strategic Shifts in a Post-Credit Era

In response to the tax credit’s demise, Tesla is pivoting toward cost efficiencies and new product unveilings, such as rumored updates to its Model Y and Cybertruck lines, to sustain buyer interest.

This 516-mile, 42-inch pipeline, an extension of the existing Transwestern pipeline, will transport 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas from the Permian Basin to growing markets in Arizona and New Mexico.

The Permian region, one of the top-producing shale basins in the world, accounts for nearly half of all U.S. oil production. Additionally, in 2024, the Permian region contributed 22% of U.S. marketed natural gas production and drove nearly all of the increase in U.S. output. Production increased by 12% (2.7 Bcfd) to 25.4 Bcfd, primarily due to associated gas from oil production. However, due to years of policy-driven underinvestment in energy infrastructure, pipelines are near capacity in the Permian Basin.

This project, with an estimated cost of $5.3 billion, including $600 million for Allowance for Funds Used During Construction, and backed by long-term commitments from investment-grade customers, is a critical investment in energy infrastructure that promises to enhance reliability, support economic growth, and meet the needs of a rapidly growing region. Scheduled for completion in Q4 2029, the Desert Southwest expansion is a forward-thinking solution to energy demand growth in the Southwest, particularly in Arizona, where the data center boom is driving unprecedented demand.

Meeting the Energy Demands of a Data-Driven Future

Arizona is emerging as a global hub for data centers, with over 129 facilities already operating in the state. The data center sector is a cornerstone of the digital economy, powering everything from cloud computing to artificial intelligence, and these facilities are energy-intensive. According to Data Center Dynamics, Arizona’s major utilities, Arizona Public Service (APS) and Salt River Project (SRP), are stepping up to meet this challenge by securing natural gas capacity from the Desert Southwest pipeline.

APS, the project’s anchor customer, has committed to spending up to $7.3 billion over 25 years to purchase gas from the expansion to fuel new gas-fired power plants. These plants, set to come online in 2029 alongside the pipeline, will directly support data centers within APS’s service territory, which spans 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties and serves 1.4 million customers. APS currently faces nearly 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of committed demand, primarily from data centers, with an additional 20GW of uncommitted large-load customers in its interconnection queue. This staggering demand underscores the urgency of reliable, scalable energy solutions like the Desert Southwest pipeline.

Safely Enhancing Energy Reliability in a Growing State

Arizona’s energy mix is heavily reliant on natural gas, which accounts for 45% of the state’s electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nuclear power contributes 27%, solar 13%, and coal 8%. As the state faces limitations in scaling renewable energy to meet round-the-clock demand, natural gas will remain an important energy source going forward. The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion will enhance the reliability of the Transwestern pipeline system, ensuring a steady supply of natural gas to power plants serving both residential and industrial customers.

The agreements between Energy Transfer, APS, and SRP provide priority delivery of natural gas, offering a stable and predictable energy source for Arizona’s utilities. This is particularly vital for data centers, which require uninterrupted power to operate effectively. By extending the Transwestern pipeline’s reach, the project adds optionality and resilience to the region’s energy infrastructure, mitigating risks of supply disruptions and supporting Arizona’s reputation as a reliable destination for tech investment.

Pipelines are critical to modern life, delivering the energy and resources that power homes, businesses, and industries. Most importantly, they do so with an impressive safety record, thanks to advanced engineering, real-time monitoring, and strict oversight. The National Pipeline Performance Measures Report, published by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), provides annual summaries of pipeline safety data for gas transmission, hazardous liquids, and gas distribution systems across the country. Over the past 20 years (2005–2024), PHMSA data show a 40% decline in significant pipeline incidents, defined as those involving fatalities, injuries requiring hospitalization, costs exceeding $50,000, liquid releases of five barrels (highly volatile) or 50 barrels (other liquids), or unintentional fires/explosions. This strong safety record underscores the reliability of projects like the Desert Southwest expansion, ensuring a steady and secure natural gas supply to meet Arizona’s growing energy demands.

Economic and Strategic Benefits

Beyond energy reliability, the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a catalyst for economic growth. By enabling utilities to meet the needs of high-growth sectors like data centers, the pipeline supports Arizona’s position as a leader in the tech industry. The state’s favorable business climate, combined with reliable energy infrastructure, makes it an attractive destination for investors looking to support projects with intensive energy demands.

Moreover, the project’s long-term commitments from investment-grade customers signal strong market confidence in its viability. These commitments reduce financial risk and ensure the pipeline’s capacity will be fully utilized, maximizing its economic impact. The expansion also aligns with broader energy trends, as natural gas continues to play a pivotal role in balancing affordability and reliability.

A Step Toward a Resilient Energy Future

The Desert Southwest pipeline expansion is a strategic investment in the Southwest’s energy and economic future. By connecting the Permian Basin’s abundant natural gas resources to Arizona’s and New Mexico’s growing markets, the project is addressing the immediate needs of utilities like APS and SRP while laying the groundwork for long-term growth. The project’s focus on reliability, supported by significant financial commitments and a clear timeline for completion, makes it a cornerstone of Arizona’s emergence as a tech powerhouse.

As data centers continue to drive demand and Arizona solidifies its role as a regional tech hub, the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion stands out as a pragmatic and forward-thinking solution.

The shutdown prohibits the EPA from obligating funds for new grants and cooperative agreements, unless they are tied to excepted activities.
Existing agreements may continue, but any new support for farmers is likely to be halted, according to the EPA plan.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- With agriculture waiting for final Renewable Fuel Standard volumes and other RFS rules, as well as a pending waters of the U.S. rule, the federal government shutdown that began on Wednesday has cast a shadow on when exactly that work could be completed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Even if the shutdown period is relatively short, a significant reduction in agency employees could further slow rulemaking.

According to an EPA shutdown plan, before the shutdown, the agency had 15,166 employees, and once the shutdown plan is implemented, just 1,734 employees are expected to be retained to execute ""excepted"" or ""exempted"" activities needed during the shutdown.

The plan states that by default, any employee not designated as excepted or exempted will be furloughed during the shutdown. The document also notes that the agency retains the authority to modify the number of personnel working during the shutdown. As of Wednesday morning, the Trump administration had not announced plans to permanently lay off EPA employees when the shutdown ends.

Right now, the shutdown will continue to at least Friday, when the U.S. Senate is next scheduled to vote on ending it.

The EPA's plan provides guidance on defining ""exempted activities"" that would continue during the government shutdown.

That includes those that are funded with ""unexpired appropriations"" where carryover funds remain unobligated.

Exempted activities also include those funded with appropriations that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, such as permanent indefinite appropriations.

For example, on Wednesday, the EPA held a virtual public hearing on the RFS volumes proposal, https://www.dtnpf.com/…, just hours after the shutdown became official.

EXEMPTED EPA ACTIVITIES

Examples of exempted activities include those funded by permanent appropriations like those under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).

The key criterion is that EPA activities must have funding sources other than the annual appropriations that have lapsed to be considered exempted and allowed to continue during a shutdown.

Based on EPA's plan, here are some key things to consider:

-- Permit approvals: The plan said that issuing new permits, guidance, regulations and policies will generally cease during a shutdown, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could delay or halt the approval of Clean Water Act permits that farmers may be waiting on.

-- Renewable Fuel Standard, waters of the U.S. rule: The plan indicates rulemaking activities, like finalizing volumes, would likely cease during the shutdown unless they are deemed necessary for excepted activities. That would include the RFS and WOTUS. A further delay on the RFS volumes is likely to make agriculture and biofuels interests pull their hair, as those volumes are already extremely late.

-- Ag chemicals: Based on the EPA plan, the approval of agriculture chemicals like pesticides and herbicides would likely be affected during the shutdown.

FUNDING DISTINCTIONS

EPA said that activities funded by permanent appropriations, such as those under FIFRA, may be considered ""exempted activities"" and allowed to continue. This would include the EPA's pesticide registration and review processes funded through FIFRA fees.

However, the issuance of new permits, guidance, regulations and policies generally ceases during a shutdown, unless they are deemed necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could delay or halt the EPA's approval of new or amended pesticide and herbicide registrations.

When it comes to existing pesticide and herbicide registrations, EPA said in the plan that work could continue if it does not require interaction with non-exempted EPA employees. This would allow some registration maintenance activities to continue.

As is the case with many EPA functions, with most EPA staff furloughed, the agency's overall capacity to review, process and approve new agriculture chemical registrations is significantly reduced during a shutdown.

-- Enforcement and compliance: EPA's plan says civil-enforcement inspections would generally cease, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities.

-- State program approvals: The plan indicates that approvals of pending state requests, such as authorized/delegated state-issued EPA permits, will likely cease during the shutdown, unless necessary for excepted or exempted activities. This could affect state-level water quality programs that farmers interact with.

An extended shutdown will likely cause delays and disruptions to a variety of EPA activities and approvals that farmers depend on, unless those activities are deemed excepted or exempted from the shutdown.

Perhaps one of the biggest effects of the shutdown is on the approval and permitting process.

Farmers who need Clean Water Act permits to conduct work on their land are facing uncertainty, as the EPA plan indicates that issuing new permits will generally cease during the shutdown, unless deemed essential.

Farmers who count on federal grants and financial assistance programs are also facing challenges.

The shutdown prohibits the EPA from obligating funds for new grants and cooperative agreements, unless they are tied to excepted activities. Existing agreements may continue, but any new support for farmers is likely to be halted, according to the EPA plan.

The first government shutdown in nearly seven years left federal agencies in flux and many of their employees in a state of confusion on Wednesday, as they received last-minute and conflicting instructions from managers.

Even though the likelihood of a shutdown has been high for months, agencies were late to post their contingency plans compared with previous years, leaving employees and the public in the dark about what to expect. And internal guidance to work forces in some cases was not consistent with the official plans. Some employees who expected to be furloughed learned on Wednesday that they had to report to work.

But despite the uncertainty inside the government, the initial ripple effects across the country were scattered and limited.

There was no major disruption to air travel. The Internal Revenue Service answered calls from taxpayers. And federal agents arrested immigrants who showed up for routine court appearances in Lower Manhattan.

But the impact was felt elsewhere. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta was closed, and visitors got a quick civic lesson: Presidential libraries are operated by the federal National Archives and Records Administration, which furloughed more than half of its staff.

“We thought it was privately funded, or we would have come yesterday,” said Cindy Mobley, 64, of Baltimore. Ms. Mobley and her husband were in town visiting their son, a freshman at nearby Emory University.

Not being able to visit the museum, Ms. Mobley said, “is a small price to pay if it leads to something better for all of our citizens.” She said she supported congressional Democrats who are refusing to agree to a spending plan that does not restore funding for Medicaid and extend health insurance subsidies.

For Chris Hill, of New York, the first day of the shutdown brought an unprompted message from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He said he had been working with the agency to resolve a benefits issue regarding his late father and was surprised to see the message informing him that the government was shut down, noting that some agency services would not be available.

The message also blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which Mr. Hill said also caught him by surprise.

“It was such a political and one-sided message sent out by a department that is supposed to deal equally with veterans, regardless of their political opinions,” he said in an interview.

Similar political responses have come from other agencies, marking what many believe to be the first time an administration has used the bureaucracy to deliver blatantly partisan messaging during a shutdown.

Legal experts say doing so violates a federal law, the Hatch Act, designed to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion. And many federal workers expressed discomfort about being drawn into the political morass.

And for at least the first week of the shutdown, the 74,299 employees at the Internal Revenue Service are working as though nothing has changed. The agency is able to do this because of a special pot of money created by Democrats in 2022 intended to fund operations when appropriated funds have run out.

The tax agency lost 25,000 employees this year under the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the government. It is racing to prepare for next year’s filing season, when many Americans could feel the effects of new tax cuts passed by Republicans this summer.

It is not clear how many people at the tax agency will continue working once the special fund is depleted. But until then, if people call the agency with a question about the upcoming extended filing deadline on Oct. 15, for example, they should be able to receive a response as if the rest of the government were not shut down.

But not all agencies were as clear and transparent as the I.R.S. when it came to telling employees what to expect on Wednesday.

Some employees at the Environmental Protection Agency were surprised late on Tuesday to learn that they would not be furloughed, as expected. The agency’s shutdown plan called for just 11 percent of the staff to continue working. Instead, the employees were told they would continue to work on activities that have yet to run out of funding.

Typically, when operations are able to continue during a government shutdown because of leftover funds, that is noted in an agency’s contingency plan. This was not the case for the E.P.A.’s plan, though, and employees wondered whether they would be working without pay.

“Continue to work on initiatives as directed by your leadership,” the head of the agency’s air office, Aaron Szabo, said in a Wednesday memo to his staff, which was reviewed by The New York Times. He advised that employees would be “notified if there is any change in status.”

Employees from some agencies noted other inconsistencies and problems, including how little notice they received about plans ahead of the shutdown.

A National Park Service employee said messaging was chaotic and changing well into Wednesday afternoon. Some employees were told that they were furloughed but that their status could change at any time.

The Statue of Liberty, which is operated by the National Park Service, was open on Wednesday, but funding was expected to run out in the coming days.

The Justice Department asked judges across the country to pause many civil cases because the department did not have the staff to handle them during the shutdown. While this is a routine outcome during a funding lapse, if the shutdown goes on for weeks it could have a real impact on cases that judges have agreed to postpone, including those challenging Trump administration policies that have been moving through the court system.

Organizations that sued the administration over funding cuts may be forced to change course and try to settle cases, said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University.

Other federal programs that the public relies on will also run out of funding if the government shutdown stretches into days or weeks, including federally funded child care and federal grocery vouchers for low-income mothers and children.

If the shutdown drags on, the Food and Drug Administration may have to stop some routine inspections of food and medication facilities.

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs.
NRDC said the cancellations also include funding for battery plants, electric grid upgrades, clean vehicle manufacturing and industrial demonstrations projects.
Gavin Newsom issued a statement confirming DOE canceled up to $1.2 billion for the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, the state’s planned hydrogen hub.
By canceling more renewable energy projects, Trump “is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans,” Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp said in a statement.","The U.S. Department of Energy on Thursday announced it has terminated $7.56 billion in financial awards to 223 clean energy projects — all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a statement.

A list of impacted projects was not immediately available. DOE said award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision and “some of the projects included in this announcement have already begun that process.”

In total, DOE said it terminated 321 financial awards issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Fossil Energy.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said DOE has been working to review “billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Of the financial awards terminated, DOE said 26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day. “Those awards alone were valued at over $3.1 billion,” the agency said.

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a post on X that the terminated projects were in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” Vought wrote.

Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates said DOE’s funding cancellation is illegal, and an example of a presidential administration executing a political vendetta that will hurt all Americans.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

“Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies,” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a social media post.

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs. It is reckless and betrays both common sense and public trust,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said in a statement.

Cutting the projects’ funding “will mean lost factory jobs and higher energy prices for American consumers,” Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Ending support for these projects will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Canceled funding awards reportedly include hydrogen projects in California and the Pacific Northwest. NRDC said the cancellations also include funding for battery plants, electric grid upgrades, clean vehicle manufacturing and industrial demonstrations projects.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement confirming DOE canceled up to $1.2 billion for the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, the state’s planned hydrogen hub.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

Ultimately, U.S. consumers will pay the price, advocates said.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

Earlier, Bloomberg reported that the planned cancellations included funding for proposed hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, criticized the administration for canceling its $1.2 billion commitment to fund his state's hydrogen hub.

""We'll continue to pursue an all-of-the-above clean energy strategy that powers our future and cleans the air, no matter what DC tries to dictate,"" Newsom said in a statement.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/ENERGY_3.JPG,N,,2025-10-02 13:09:47.205913

The Colorado Energy Office announced Thursday morning that the state rebate for new EV purchases will increase to $9,000 from $6,000, and the rebate for used EV purchases will increase to $6,000 from $4,000.
The rebate program is paid for by the state’s Community Access Enterprise, which is funded through fees charged to rideshare companies and retail delivery services such as DoorDash.
The increased rebate amounts reflect Colorado policymakers’ belief that electric vehicles are the automobile of the future, Toor said.
“Colorado has emerged as the top electric vehicle market in the country as far as market share.","Colorado is increasing the amount of money offered through the state’s electric vehicle rebate program in November as a response to President Donald Trump’s elimination of federal tax credits for the same purchases.

The Colorado Energy Office announced Thursday morning that the state rebate for new EV purchases will increase to $9,000 from $6,000, and the rebate for used EV purchases will increase to $6,000 from $4,000.

The increased rebates begin Nov. 3, one month after the federal tax credit for purchases ended on Sept. 30 as part of Trump’s plan to push fossil fuels in the United States despite their contribution to climate change.

“The change that we’re making right now is really in response to the fact that the Trump administration has effectively just increased taxes on people by removing the tax credits for electric vehicles and made it harder for folks to afford EVs,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “We are responding by increasing the incentives that are available.”

Colorado’s rebate remains dependent on a household’s income. A buyer must make less than 80% of the area median income in whichever county they live.

For example, a Denver household of four people must have an income of $112,080 or less, according to the energy office’s income qualification chart. A single person in Denver would need to earn $78,480 or less.

Those who receive the rebate must exchange an older, high-emissions vehicle. The rebate is given at the time of the new car purchase, so buyers do not have to wait until they file income taxes to benefit. People can apply online at coloradoenergyoffice.aptim.com.

The rebate program is paid for by the state’s Community Access Enterprise, which is funded through fees charged to rideshare companies and retail delivery services such as DoorDash.

Colorado’s budget crunch, which is requiring legislators to trim $1 billion from the state’s general fund, does not impact the program, Toor said. The enterprise fund money is dedicated to increasing the use of electric cars, trucks and bicycles in the state.

Funding for the increased incentives will come from the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, and the ongoing funding for the exchange program is expected through June 30, 2032.

The state started its Vehicle Exchange Colorado program in 2023 and has issued rebates toward 2,743 car purchases, said Ed Piersa, senior program manager at the energy office.

The increased rebate amounts reflect Colorado policymakers’ belief that electric vehicles are the automobile of the future, Toor said.

Electric vehicles have proven to be a popular option for Colorado’s drivers.

More than 200,000 electric vehicles are registered in Colorado, and the cars and trucks have accounted for more than a quarter of all new vehicle sales in the state in 2025, the energy office reported.

Encouraging more people to drive them improves Colorado’s air quality and helps the state reach its climate goals of eliminating almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. For drivers, the vehicles have lower fuel and maintenance costs than gas-powered vehicles, Toor said.

“We think it’s really important to continue the momentum on EVs here,” Toor said. “Colorado has emerged as the top electric vehicle market in the country as far as market share. We want to maintain that momentum even as the federal government goes in the other direction.”",https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-VOLKSWAGEN-EV_DSC9719x.jpg?w=1024&h=692,N,,2025-10-02 12:05:43.991267

Cancels Hundreds of Clean-Energy Projects, Mostly in Blue States","Brad Plumer, Maxine Joselow, www.nytimes.com, brad-plumer, maxine-joselow",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/climate/doe-clean-energy-programs-shutdown.html,"The Energy Department said on Wednesday night that it was terminating more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for hundreds of energy projects, with the vast majority located in states led by Democrats.

In the meantime, many state officials, members of Congress and energy executives were scrambling on Wednesday to figure out which projects would be affected.
Congress had authorized roughly $8 billion for so-called hydrogen hubs as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021.
None of the hubs in Republican-controlled states such as West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana were affected by the latest round of cancellations.","The Energy Department said on Wednesday night that it was terminating more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for hundreds of energy projects, with the vast majority located in states led by Democrats.

The move underscored how the Trump administration appeared to be using the government shutdown to punish its political opponents. President Trump said this week that if Democrats in Congress did not vote for a funding bill to keep the government open, he could “do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them.”

In its Wednesday announcement, the Energy Department did not specify which projects were being cut. But according to an agency document reviewed by The New York Times, the list of canceled projects includes major upgrades to electrical grids in California and Minnesota, as well as large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest.

In a news release, the Energy Department said it had determined that the projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The move met swift condemnation from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, where one of the largest canceled projects had been projected to create more than 220,000 jobs. “In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “We’ll continue to pursue an all-of-the-above clean-energy strategy that powers our future and cleans the air, no matter what D.C. tries to dictate.”

Before the Energy Department announced the cancellations, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, suggested in social media posts that they were imminent. “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” he wrote on X.

Mr. Vought did not provide details, and the Energy Department did not issue the news release until several hours later. In the meantime, many state officials, members of Congress and energy executives were scrambling on Wednesday to figure out which projects would be affected.

Two of the largest canceled awards would have gone toward projects in California and the Pacific Northwest that focused on the production, transportation and storage of clean hydrogen, which has the potential to produce steel and fertilizer, or to power trucks, without producing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Congress had authorized roughly $8 billion for so-called hydrogen hubs as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law of 2021. The Biden administration had awarded roughly $1 billion apiece to seven such hubs across the country.

None of the hubs in Republican-controlled states such as West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana were affected by the latest round of cancellations.

Greg Keoleian, a professor at the University of Michigan whose research focuses on hydrogen, said the canceled projects would have helped the United States compete with China and Europe, which have more mature hydrogen industries. “We need to be investing in clean energy technologies like hydrogen for global competitiveness,” Dr. Keoleian said.

Also targeted for cancellation was a $464 million grant awarded to Minnesota to help improve the connections between two large regional electrical grids in the Midwest and Great Plains. That project was aimed at making it easier to add more renewable energy to the grid and reducing the risk of blackouts. Proponents said it would have helped reduce electricity costs across a wide region, including in Republican-led states.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/multimedia/02cli-clean-energy-cuts-fjkz/02cli-clean-energy-cuts-fjkz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:06:38.458153

The city is actively seeking public comment on the draft to ensure the final plan reflects community priorities and needs.

“Louisville continues to innovate, set ambitious goals, and lead with purpose,” said Mayor Greenberg. “This plan is about building a city that works better for everyone. A city where clean air, smart infrastructure, and economic opportunity go hand in hand. We’ve had meaningful conversations with the public and we invite everyone to stay involved and help guide the next steps.”

Louisville hired AECOM and EHI Consultants in November of 2024 to help create a two-part EV Readiness Plan. The draft of the community plan outlines recommendations and strategies to expand public EV infrastructure and remove barriers to EV adoption. A forthcoming component of the plan outlines steps needed to transition the city’s fleet to zero-emission vehicles. Together, both components support the city’s sustainability goals of achieving 100% clean energy for Metro Government operations by 2035 and 100% community-wide by 2040.

What’s in the Plan:

Current EV Trends & Future Demand: EV ownership in Jefferson County tripled between 2021 and 2024, signaling the need for a major scale-up in public charging infrastructure to meet projected growth through 2040.

Community Voices and Ideas: Insights from surveys, focus groups, and stakeholder engagement shaped the plan’s priorities, identifying barriers such as cost, EV range concerns, and lack of home charging access.

Infrastructure Gaps & Priority Areas: The plan pinpoints areas most in need of charging stations, including multifamily housing, employment hubs, shopping destinations, and historically underserved neighborhoods.

Implementation Strategies: Outlines actions guiding a citywide EV transition, including public-private deployment models, workforce training, permitting reform, and funding pathways.

“We’ve heard from residents, community organizations, and key stakeholders across Louisville,” said Katie Littman, Deputy Director for the Cabinet of Economic Development. “They told us where charging is needed, the barriers that stand in the way, and how we can make this transition work for everyone in our city.”

The Cabinet for Economic Development assembled a steering committee of internal agencies to lead this process, including the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Facilities and Fleet. The Department of Transportation will lead implementation moving forward.

The release of the draft plan follows a major announcement from Ford Motor Company. In August, Ford announced it will invest $2 billion to retool Louisville’s Assembly Plant for electric vehicle production. The investment secured 2,200 local jobs and put Louisville firmly at the forefront of Ford’s EV rollout.

Residents, businesses, and organizations are encouraged to review the plan and share feedback. The public comment period is now open and will run through Friday, October 31. Click here to view the EV Readiness Plan.

The world’s desire for trade shows no signs of abating, and with 80% of traded goods transported by sea, the shipping industry will continue to grow. The worldwide fleet reached a record size in 2024, and shipping is currently on track to increase its share of global carbon dioxide emissions to 17% by 2050.

Future-proofing ports

The transformation underway — as set out in a new report from C40 Cities and global built environment consultancy Arup — presents a strategic lever for cities and industry to enhance urban prosperity and resilience.

By leveraging three key investment opportunities, ports have the chance to become engines of 21st-century green growth. Fortunately, this work is already underway in ports across continents:

1. Sustainable fuel hubs

Ports can become global leaders in the production and export of cleaner fuels, such as green ammonia and green methanol. This isn’t just about a healthier planet; it’s about creating entirely new industries and jobs.

Durban, home to South Africa’s busiest container port, is part of a wider Hydrogen Valley opportunity across the country, which could create thousands of jobs, de-risk investments in hydrogen fuel cells, and position South Africa as a key energy exporter internationally.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Unigel’s Camaçari project is Brazil’s first large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia facility. Following an initial $120 million injection, the facility is set to reel in $1.5 billion in private finance, scaling production to 100,000 metric tons of green hydrogen by 2027. Investments of this scale could create significant numbers of jobs in e-fuel production, renewable energy generation, and their supply chains.

2. Electrification hubs

By electrifying port operations, from ships at berth to cranes and trucks, cities can dramatically improve public health — reducing dangerous particulate emissions, lowering noise pollution, and increasing the quality of life for port communities.

The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach have already raised over $115 million through a fee placed on the most polluting trucks to facilitate the shift to cleaner alternatives, with funds dedicated to supporting this transition. Studies in Seattle and New York show that full electrification of harbor operations could slash fine particulate matter levels by up to 75% and 69% respectively. This is about delivering a better quality of life and a healthier future for communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution.

3. Offshore wind hubs

Ports could also serve as vital manufacturing and installation hubs for wind turbines. This enables deployment of large-scale renewables, creates new economic opportunities, and delivers thousands of skilled green jobs in communities that need them most.

The Port of Pecém in the Brazilian state of Ceará is home to two wind blade factories and is now exporting wind components globally, while the Empire Wind 1 development in New York City is set to power 500,000 homes, supported by the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. This is about turning once underused land into productive, clean energy assets that power our cities.

Prosperous ports, empowered people, protected planet

All the examples above — and the many more being developed around the world — have one thing in common: They benefit both people and the planet. For our future energy transition to be successful, it must work for everyone. In port cities, a rising tide must lift all boats.

This is only possible by investing in workforce development — providing training and upskilling opportunities that empower workers to transition from legacy industries to the clean economy. It means involving trade unions, academic institutions, and national governments, avoiding silos, and ensuring an inclusive transition for all.

The path ahead is clear. Investing in ports as clean energy hubs isn’t just a choice, it’s a necessity. It is the most direct way to prove that a thriving economy and a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are profoundly and intimately intertwined. By embracing this crucial opportunity, port cities will drive a just transition that benefits people, the planet, and the global economy for generations to come.","https://res.cloudinary.com/devex/image/fetch/g_south_east,h_127,l_devexLogo_on_orange_xneahv.svg,o_80,w_240/https://neo-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/news/images/110868.jpg",N,,2025-10-02 13:04:52.543372

Tesla reported record-breaking third-quarter vehicle deliveries of 497,099 units on October 2, 2025, substantially exceeding Wall Street expectations of around 447,600 deliveries. The 7% year-over-year increase came as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of a federal tax credit that ended as part of President Donald Trump’s spending bill passed in July. The strong delivery numbers pushed Tesla shares up over 1% following the announcement, with the company set to report full financial results on October 22, 2025.

Record Q3 Deliveries Fueled by Expiring EV Tax Credits

Tesla’s third-quarter performance marked a significant turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines earlier in 2025. The company delivered 497,099 vehicles during the period ended September 30, up from 462,890 deliveries in the same quarter of 2024. Production totaled 447,450 vehicles for the quarter, with the company manufacturing 435,826 of its popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The surge in deliveries was partially driven by U.S. customers rushing to take advantage of a federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers before it expired at the end of September.

The tax credit expiration was part of President Donald Trump’s spending bill that passed in July 2025. This deadline created urgency among potential EV buyers, particularly offsetting weakness in European markets where Tesla faced declining sales due to consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s political activism and increased competition from manufacturers like Volkswagen and BYD. The company’s energy storage business also performed strongly, deploying 12.5 GWh of battery storage products including Megapack and Megablock systems, up significantly from 6.9 GWh in the third quarter of 2024.

Shares Hold Momentum, But Profit Margins Raise Questions

As of 10:06 AM EDT on October 2, 2025, Tesla stock (TSLA) was trading at $458.26, down $1.20 or 0.26% for the day, though shares had climbed over 1% immediately following the delivery report announcement. The stock has demonstrated remarkable momentum recently, jumping 40% during the third quarter and turning positive for the year with a 14% year-to-date gain, compared to the Nasdaq’s 18% rise. Tesla’s market capitalization stood at $1.523 trillion, with the stock trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 261.79 based on earnings per share of $1.75.

Despite the strong delivery numbers, Tesla faces significant headwinds in the fourth quarter and beyond without the federal tax credit incentive. Analyst price targets for the stock range widely from a low of $115 to a high of $600, with an average target of $345.50, suggesting substantial uncertainty about the company’s valuation. The company’s automotive margins have compressed from 23% to 17.2%, raising questions about profitability as Tesla competes with lower-priced competitors like BYD’s $10,000 vehicles. Investors will be closely watching Tesla’s October 22 earnings call for guidance on how the expiration of federal EV incentives will impact demand in future quarters.

Tesla FSD V14: Next Big Catalyst?

Tesla investors and fans will now turn their attention to self-driving. Musk said Sept. 25 on his social site X that Full Self-Driving version 14 will have an ""early wide"" release this week. FSD v14 hasn't arrived yet.

Analyst Hails 'Massive Bounceback' In Deliveries

Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a long-time Tesla bull, hailed a ""great bounceback quarter"" for the EV giant. While acknowledging that Tesla benefited from the now-expired tax credits, he sees reasons to be hopeful about China and even Europe.

But he also said attention remains on Tesla self-driving ambitions, which accounts for the bulk of his street-high 600 price target on TSLA stock.

Rivian Narrows Delivery Guidance

Also early Thursday, Rivian (RIVN) disclosed that it produced 10,720 vehicles in Q3 and delivered 13,201. That was in line with the company's forecast. For the full year, Rivian now expects to deliver 41,500-43,500 vehicles vs. prior guidance for 40,000-46,000. That reduces the midpoint of the guidance to 42,500 from 43,000.

Rivian stock fell solidly at the open.

9:14 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Going Forward?

U.S. buyers who made a firm order before Sept. 30 will still get the $7,500 tax credit when they take delivery in the next several weeks. Still, U.S. demand is expected to plunge in Q4 and remain weak for some time.

Some other automakers have already slashed U.S. EV prices to bolster demand. Tesla also could end up cutting U.S. prices somewhat. Even so a lot of demand has been pulled forward.

Tesla is expected to release a stripped-down, more-affordable Model Y in Q4. But if the price tag is higher than what U.S. consumers paid for a ""real"" Model Y with the tax credit, that won't entice many domestic sales.

A cheaper Model Y might do better in China, though it could cannibalize other Model Y sales.

The China EV industry tends to have its best quarter in Q4. That may be particularly true this year, with tax credits phasing out on Dec. 31. Tesla China sales have been falling in 2025 amid rising overall EV sales, but will likely see at least another quarter-to-quarter gain in Q4.

However, that would set up an even-bigger drop in Tesla sales in Q1 2026.

9:10 a.m. ET

Tesla Stock Rises

Tesla stock rose more than 3% to about 474 following the Q3 deliveries release. Shares had been up slightly, heading into the data, continuing a powerful run toward record highs in recent weeks. TSLA stock is closing in on the late December all-time high of 488.54.

9:08 a.m. ET

Record Energy Storage Deployed

Tesla deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage in Q3 vs. 9.6 GWh in Q2 and 6.9 GWh in Q3 2024.

9:05 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Hit Record

Tesla delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, up from 384,122 in Q2 and 462,890 in Q3 2024. That topped the prior all-time high of 495,570 in Q4 2024.

That included 481,166 Model 3 and Model Y EVs and 15,933 ""other"" vehicles, which include the Model S, Model X and Cybertruck.

Tesla produced 447,450 EVs in Q3.

8:43 a.m. ET

Tesla Deliveries Likely Around 9 a.m. ET

Tesla doesn't offer a set time, or even a set date, for its quarterly delivery and production releases. But for several quarters the EV giant has done so on the second day of the new quarter, at 9:00 a.m. ET or just after.

8:03 a.m. ET

Tesla Stock Rising Into Deliveries

Tesla stock rose 2% to 468.51 before Thursday's open, after hitting a 2025 peak on Wednesday.

Tesla Deliveries

Tesla will likely release deliveries around 9 a.m. ET. Deliveries are expected to come in at 456,490, according to the analyst consensus forecast compiled by FactSet. That would be up 18.9% vs. Q2's 384,122, but down 1.4% from 462,890 in Q3 2024.

However, many analysts haven't updated targets since late July. More-recent Tesla delivery forecasts have been in the 470,000-495,000 range.

Troy Teslike, an online Tesla forecaster with a strong record, predicts 481,000 deliveries.

Tesla deliveries hit a record 495,570 in Q4 2024.

Tesla's China and European registrations ran below year-earlier levels, though Chinese sales were up substantially vs. Q2.

The big driver for Q3 deliveries was the Sept. 30 expiration of the $7,500 U.S. tax credit, pulling forward demand. Buyers can take delivery later and still get the EV tax credit as long as they make a firm order by Sept. 30 with at least a nominal payment.

Still, U.S. Tesla demand will likely plunge in Q4 and remain weak for some time. CEO Elon Musk said on the Q2 earnings call that Tesla faces a few ""rough"" quarters following the end of U.S. tax credits.

So, whether Tesla deliveries are strong or weak may not be that meaningful for future EV business.

Tesla Energy Storage

In addition to EV delivery and production figures, Tesla will report energy storage deployed in Q3. Tesla Energy has been a bright spot in the company's current business. In Q2, Tesla deployed 9.6 gigawatt hours of energy storage, down from 10.4 GWh in Q1 and just above Q2 2024's 9.4 GWh.

In Q3 2024, Tesla deployed 6.9 GWh.

Tesla FSD v14 Release

Musk said Sept. 25 on his social site X that Full Self-Driving v14 will have an ""early wide"" release this week. It's unclear if that means all FSD users with Hardware 4.0 will gain access, or if FSD v14 will initially go to a limited number, such as Tesla influencers. Tesla vehicles with HW3.0 will not get FSD v14.

Musk also wrote that FSD v14.1 should follow two weeks later, with v14.2 soon after. ""The car will feel almost like it is sentient being by 14.2,"" Musk wrote.

Musk has previously described FSD v14 as ""sentient."" In years past, Musk would refer to big Tesla FSD updates as ""mind-blowing"" or ""blow your mind.""

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock rose slightly in premarket trade. Shares rose 3.3% to 459.46 in Wednesday's stock market trading, hitting a fresh 2025 best. TSLA stock is closing in on the late December all-time high of 488.54. Investors could use that as a buy point, but Tesla currently is significantly extended from the 21-day and 50-day lines.

One HVAC tech shared in the r/HVAC subreddit that even in single-digit temperatures, a heat pump they'd installed kept a customer's home at a toasty 77 degrees Fahrenheit, even without a backup heating system.

""Pretty impressed by the carrier comfort heat pump units,"" they wrote.

However, the homeowner wasn't quite as thrilled with its performance.

""We had a call in this morning from an unhappy customer,"" the original poster continued. ""We installed a new carrier comfort heat pump system for them back in August 2024. She was upset because the house was not 86F like she set it at.""

But the temperature had dropped to a chilly four degrees Fahrenheit, and the system was not set on auxiliary heat to provide additional warmth. All things considered, the heat pump did an excellent job keeping the home toasty, even though it wasn't quite to the homeowners' liking. That said, recent advancements in cold climate heat pumps have significantly improved their efficiency and heating capacity in freezing weather, according to Natural Resources Canada.

Heat pumps outperform traditional HVAC systems in energy efficiency, with the clean energy nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute reporting that heat pumps are between 2.2 and 4.5 times more efficient than Energy Star-rated gas furnaces. This increased efficiency translates to lower energy bills, as it reduces electricity consumption by around 75%, per the Department of Energy. And since heat pumps can both heat and cool your home, you can enjoy savings all year round.

You can also snag a 30% tax credit (up to $2,000) for qualifying heat pumps through the Inflation Reduction Act, though you'll want to act by Dec. 31 when the incentives will expire.

Rivian narrowed its 2025 delivery guidance to 41,500–43,500 vehicles despite a 32% Q3 delivery surge.

The expiration of U.S. EV tax credits and high tariffs are increasing costs and creating uncertainty for the EV market.

Rising vehicle costs and supply chain pressures may impact Rivian’s profitability as it prepares to launch its R2 SUVs next year.

EV startup Rivian lowered its 2025 delivery guidance Thursday, projecting 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles for the year as it adjusts to the end of federal tax credits and rising manufacturing costs. The revision follows the company’s previous cut in May from as many as 51,000 vehicles.

Notably, the company reported a nearly 32% increase in third-quarter (Q3) deliveries, totaling 13,201 vehicles and surpassing analysts’ forecast of 12,690. The surge also reflects the rush by U.S buyers to secure tax credits before they expired Tuesday.

Industry analysts predict that the expiration of consumer tax credits could negatively impact EV sales and leasing in the coming quarters. In addition, tariffs on imported auto parts have increased production costs and compressed margins for EV makers, forcing companies like Rivian to reorganize supply chains, reduce foreign dependency, and expand U.S. manufacturing investments.

The combined pressures come as the EV maker prepares to launch its more affordable R2 SUV next year, a key step in its effort to boost profitability. Rising vehicle costs, coupled with policy changes, could impact margins as the company seeks to expand its market reach.

Further, Rivian’s leadership has emphasized that navigating these challenges will require careful management of production, costs, and inventory. Analysts note that while short-term delivery numbers may fluctuate, long-term growth depends on both the company’s ability to scale its more accessible models and ongoing shifts in U.S. EV policy.

Despite the uncertainties, Rivian’s Q3 performance shows that demand remains resilient when incentives are in place, even as the EV market adjusts to a changing policy environment and higher costs.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102025-Rivian-Q3-deliveries--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:06:05.052887

However, I’m making an exception today, because exploring the idea of “internalized capitalism” has helped me understand some of my own unhelpful ideas and behaviors, as well as those of my colleagues and external collaborators.
Upon reflection, I believe that internalized capitalism almost certainly played a role in that.
You may be suffering from internalized capitalism if you do any of the following: Prioritize work over health, relationships, pleasure, etc.
Internalized capitalism is typically presented as an entirely bad thing, but my perspective on it is somewhat more nuanced.","Regular readers of this column may have noticed that although I often write about the economy, I never use the word capitalism. This is not an accident. Many people have strong feelings about capitalism, either loving it or hating it, and those feelings are often rooted in narrowly partisan understandings of what capitalism actually is. As a result, discussing it can quickly deteriorate into unproductive bickering. I have no desire to participate in that, so I typically use the word extractive to refer to the problematic aspects of our economy and the word regenerative to advocate for redesigning our economy to equitably meet human needs and support human wellbeing, while repairing ecosystems and making it possible to live within the boundaries of what our planet can provide.

However, I’m making an exception today, because exploring the idea of “internalized capitalism” has helped me understand some of my own unhelpful ideas and behaviors, as well as those of my colleagues and external collaborators. This is top of mind for me right now, because I recently completed a three-month sabbatical, during which I had hoped/planned to prioritize rest (while also writing a book proposal), and though I did slow down somewhat, it was harder to let go of “the grind” than I had anticipated. Upon reflection, I believe that internalized capitalism almost certainly played a role in that.

In case you’re not familiar with the term, “internalized capitalism” describes when a person (usually unconsciously) adopts the values and expectations of a capitalist economy as their own internal standards, especially in regard to productivity, efficiency and accomplishments. You may be suffering from internalized capitalism if you do any of the following:

Prioritize work over health, relationships, pleasure, etc.;

Feel guilty or lazy for taking breaks or engaging in “unproductive” activities;

Tie your self-worth to your productivity, accomplishments, and/or economic success;

See everything as a competition and relentlessly pursue “wins”;

Believe that achievements, wealth, and/or material possessions will make you happy.

Internalized capitalism is typically presented as an entirely bad thing, but my perspective on it is somewhat more nuanced. I recognize that our economic system has created opportunities for innovation that have improved human wellbeing in a variety of ways. For example, I’m grateful for the invention of technologies like dishwashers and washing machines that make it quicker and easier for me to clean my house. In terms of how I have internalized this quality of our economic system, I suspect that my can-do attitude when it comes to problem solving may stem from the spirit of creativity and innovation that our economy fosters. On the flip side, it has probably also contributed to my general distaste for household chores, given that our economy chronically undervalues domestic labor.

During my sabbatical, I noticed that my urge to “be productive” sometimes undermines my ability to actually do good work. For example, my best ideas often come to me when I’m walking the dog, taking a shower, or gardening, but since those activities aren’t included in my job description and don’t look or feel like work, I’m reluctant to dedicate much time to them. So I’ll sit in front of my computer and struggle to figure something out that would immediately pop into my head if I were to just take a break. Then I end up spending even more time at my computer, because I feel like I didn’t accomplish enough, thereby creating a vicious cycle.

Though I’m concerned about my own tendency to overwork and don’t want my health and relationships to suffer because of my job, I believe my specific line of work (addressing the climate crisis) does warrant a sense of urgency and probably some degree of self-sacrifice. Furthermore, I’m typically good at being productive and efficient, and I don’t want those skills to go to waste, so as long as I am applying them toward the cause of making the world a better place, that seems like a strategic and responsible choice. However, I believe there’s truth in the famous Einstein quote about not being able to solve our problems with the same mindset that created them, and it’s clear to me that our culture’s relentless pursuit of more/bigger/faster is largely responsible for getting us into this mess in the first place, so learning to slow down and prioritize rest may actually be the more strategic and responsible choice for me and many other people over the long term.

Ultimately, my personal decisions about whether to work or nap are of little consequence, but as a broader society, it’s important for us to grapple with how our economic system shapes our beliefs about who we are and how we should spend our time and energy. Internalized capitalism is a systemic issue that plays out in our individual minds, and because our cultural obsession with productivity and personal gain can undermine our collective wellbeing, it’s in our best interest to recognize and resist its downsides. As described by The Stand Up Philosophers, those downsides include how capitalism’s “emphasis on individual success and competition… [leads] to social inequality and the marginalisation of those who are unable to keep up with the demands of the market.”

Ironically, writing this column has been unusually challenging for me and has taken much longer than expected, specifically because I am trying to catch up on all the work that didn’t get done during my sabbatical, while also resisting my own workaholism. My fundamental challenge is that I want and need to do more things than I realistically have time for, so compulsively striving for productivity and efficiency feels necessary and strategic. I’m therefore faced with the sad truth that if I don’t overwork, I will accomplish less, at least in terms of accomplishments that our economy and culture values.

Repsol’s Texas Portfolio

Pecan Prairie represents the first project from Repsol’s 2024 acquisition of ConnectGen to advance into the construction phase. It also becomes the company’s fifth solar project in the U.S. to reach construction status.

The project joins Repsol’s expanding Texas portfolio, which already includes the 629 MW Outpost Solar Facility in Webb County, the 632 MW Frye Solar Project in Swisher County, and the 825 MW Pinnington in Jack County. Together, they bring the company’s total renewable capacity in the state to 2,681 MW under operation or development. Beyond Texas, Repsol also operates Jicarilla 1 and 2 in New Mexico, contributing an additional 145 MW, including 20 MW of storage.

Key Quote

At the groundbreaking ceremony, attended by company officials, suppliers, and community members, Federico Toro, CEO of Repsol Renewables North America, underscored the project’s dual role in advancing Repsol’s strategic targets and supporting local communities.

“With Pecan Prairie, we are executing on our acquisition of ConnectGen and advancing toward our U.S. renewable growth ambitions,” he said.

Regional Context

Texas continues to lead U.S. solar expansion thanks to the availability large tracts of land, high solar irradiance and an already set-up transmission infrastructure. Favorable regulatory policies and tax incentives also go without say especially with the Trump’s administration crackdown on renewables like wind and solar through policies and acts like the “Big Beautiful Big”.

Projects like Repsol’s Pecan Prairie, Outpost, Frye, and Pinnington also continue to form part of a cluster that is reinforcing Texas’s position as a key node in the U.S. clean energy transition.

Market Outlook

Large-scale solar projects in Texas are often in the not-urban counties. As with most investments, these bring capital inflow, jobs during construction, tax revenues, and often land leases with them.

On their own part, they also benefit from long-term PPAs and offtake contracts which help de-risk them as investments. Repsol’s acquisition of ConnectGen in 2024 is also bearing fruit as Pecan Prairie is the first of those acquired projects to reach construction.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Repsol-Breaks-Ground-on-595-MW-Pecan-Prairie-Solar-Facility-Project-in-Texas.avif,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:23.024648

The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

The company reported Thursday that sales in the three months through September rose 7% compared to the same period a year ago. The gain follows two quarters of steep declines as people turned off by CEO Elon Musk's foray into right-wing politics avoided buying his company's cars and even protested at some dealerships.

Sales rose to 497,099 vehicles, compared with with 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected sales to fall slightly to 456,000, even with a boost from customers seeking to use the electric vehicle incentive.

Tesla stock rose nearly 2% to $468.52 in early morning trading on the news.

Investors have been optimistic about the company in recent weeks, sending the stock up 34% in September alone. They are betting Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales. He had promised that car earlier this year. Now the launch is expected in the current quarter or early next year.

The rise in the stock also reflects Musk success in shifting attention away from car sales to other aspects of the business — the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service planned for several cities and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.

The 7% rise for the third quarter compares with a 13% plunge in the first quarter when Musk led President Donald Trump’s government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales fell again 13%.

The backlash in Europe against Musk had been also been fierce with sales plunging 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.

Market share for new battery-electric vehicles was already stuck in single digits before the $7,500 tax incentive expired after Sept. 30. Now, forecasters are scaling back their targets as affordability worries deepen.

U.S. EV share will hover below 10 percent this year without federal support, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. It will likely rise to around 25 percent by 2030, she said. That’s just half of the most optimistic industry forecasts from a few years ago.

Still, 25 percent market share takes EVs out of the “‘niche’ category,” Valdez Streaty said. She urged automakers to address EV headwinds such as affordability and charging.

“The market’s going to have to figure out how to move forward with better product, more affordable product and educating consumers on why an EV is a good option,” she said.

Cox reported in September that EVs were about $9,000 more expensive on average than comparable gasoline models. EV incentives helped bridge the gap.

Ford CEO Jim Farley cautioned that Trump administration policies ending the EV credit and easing emissions rules on gasoline vehicles could shift sales away from electric models.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be way smaller than what we thought,” Farley said Sept. 30 at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the EV sales in this country go down to 5 percent of our industry.” Farley didn’t give a time frame.

Four years ago, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis issued a joint statement saying they aspired to achieve a 40-50 percent market share for EVs, including plug-in hybrids, by 2030. Then-President Joe Biden set his target at 50 percent.

Consulting firm EY said in September that EV adoption in the U.S. is now projected to reach 50 percent in 2039, five years later than previously forecast. It cited slower growth from the repeal of the EV incentive, tariffs and other policy changes.

EV growth will continue, analysts say

To be sure, it’s not all doom and gloom for battery-electric vehicles. Following an expected fourth-quarter sales dive, some analysts see a recovery next year as automakers increase incentives and launch more affordable models to sustain growth.

“Despite any short-term drop-off in electric vehicle sales or share, we do expect that to continue growing and it’s important not to lose sight of that,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice.

J.D. Power cut its forecast for 2030 EV share to 26 percent this year, 10 percentage points lower than last year’s projection.

But the data provider also found reasons for optimism: A recent consumer survey showed more than half of new-car shoppers were very likely or somewhat likely to consider an EV in the next 12 months.

“I’m a firm believer that there is a baseline level of interest in electric vehicles regardless of this chaos with incentives,” Gruber said.

J.D. Power projects U.S. EV retail share will stay flat at about 9 percent this year, rise to 12 percent next year and then climb gradually into the mid-teens by 2027 and the low-20s by 2029.

Current EV owners are expected to remain loyal to the fuel type while newcomers are drawn to fresh models and better charging infrastructure, Gruber said.

A separate survey showed 10 percent of U.S. consumers are likely to buy an EV for their next vehicle, Here Technologies and SBD Automotive said in September. That rises to 25 percent when asked if they are likely to buy one in the next five years.

EV demand debate

But not everyone is buying forecasts that 1 in 4 vehicles will be fully electric by the end of the decade. The Trump administration removed both the “carrot” for buying EVs — the tax incentive — and the “stick” by relaxing emissions rules.

“I’m fascinated to see where we end up with purely organic consumer-driven demand versus government putting their finger on the scale, which is what they’ve been doing for a long time,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. “In my opinion, we’re going to settle in around 4 percent, maybe a little lower.”

While electric vehicles are great for some use cases — such as urban driving in warm states such as California — automakers are better off investing in hybrids that reduce emissions without the charging and range hassles, Brauer said.

Some brands, facing financial pressures with tariffs and failed EV investments, are already pulling back, Brauer said, citing news reports on canceled EV projects.

“People ask when are EVs going to sell like internal combustion vehicles and I say not until they are just like combustion vehicles,” Brauer said. That means when they cost the same, can go 500 miles on a charge and refuel in under 10 minutes, he said.

I’m fascinated to see where we end up with purely organic consumer-driven demand versus government putting their finger on the scale, which is what they’ve been doing for a long time.

Some EV advocates aren’t worried about consumer demand, which is growing along with charging infrastructure, the number of affordable EVs in the U.S. market and consumer awareness. The U.S. may lag behind China and Europe, but the path is the same, they say.

“The major problem is going to be on the supply side not on the demand side,” said Loren McDonald, CEO of EV data firm Chargenomics. “What we’re starting to see is the automakers are all feeling like they’re getting permission to cut their losses.”

Acura ended production of the ZDX crossover after one model year, Nissan has paused U.S. sales of its Ariya crossover for the 2026 model year and Ram canceled its future EV pickup.

While automakers will likely use the current environment to kill off EVs that aren’t selling, McDonald said they’ll also work on a new generation “that are going to be way better and sell better.”

A few examples: Acura plans to launch its new RSX compact crossover next year on a new platform, Nissan has launched a new generation of the Leaf EV and startups Rivian and Slate have fresh models coming with a focus on value.

McDonald doubts that EV share will plunge to 4 percent. Sales will be sluggish short term, but then bounce back, he said.

“We’ll see some exciting new models, good lease prices and people are just going to forget about the tax credit,” McDonald said.

Leaders from Albemarle Corporation, the Aluminium Association of Canada, Old Harbor Native Corporation, Panasonic North America, and South32 contributed to the conversation.

Multiple participants weighed in on the challenges associated with the permitting process for critical mineral projects. Judy Brown, head of external affairs for the Americas at diversified mining company South32, emphasized the difficulties involved in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process: “When the lead agency and another agency do not agree, the issue is that strategic decisions just don’t get made,” and projects end up just sitting on the shelf in limbo. Kristina Woolston, CEO of the Old Harbor Native Corporation, a native village corporation based on Kodiak Island, Alaska, showed just how long a project can take. She previously worked on the Donlin Gold project, which she said took decades for design, exploration, engineering, and permitting, nearly seven years for the joint record of decision, and six years of litigation.

That experience is why Woolston is excited about the bipartisan Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, which would limit litigation standing to those who participated in the comment period and shorten the time to file suit to 150 days, rather than six years. “I think that’s so important for Native communities, because we are talking about extremely limited resources. We have partners that come to the table with us to help us develop these resources. But if we can’t bring in partners to help us develop, there’s no way we’d be able to afford it… So by utilizing the SPEED Act, we feel that it will encourage investors, because there will again be more liability and accountability.”

Alex Stroman, vice president of government relations and regulatory affairs at Albemarle Corporation, the world’s largest lithium company, the only one to be fully integrated “from mine to brine to market,” and the operator of the only active lithium mine in the U.S., in Silver Peak, Nevada, emphasized that the topic is bipartisan issue, adding that “the Trump administration has been excellent at prioritizing critical minerals.” He pointed to an executive order from March, which directed the National Energy Dominance Council to submit lists of priority projects to the Permitting Council for inclusion in the FAST-41 program, providing improved transparency and interagency coordination for streamlined environmental reviews and permitting support. Essentially, the executive order said, “We want to make it the policy of the United States to be the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals.”

Albemarle’s expansion of its lithium mine in Silver Peak, Nevada, and its construction of a lithium material processing plant in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, are both FAST-41 Transparency Projects involved in this process. Other leaders in the conversation noted that their projects had also been included in the FAST-41 program. Brown said that South32’s Hermosa project in Arizona, the country’s sole advanced mine development project capable of producing two critical minerals — zinc and manganese — was facing a five-year permitting schedule before it became a FAST-41 Covered Project. One of the benefits, she described, is that the program “relieved a lot of risks that people see around investing in the U.S.” Additionally, Woolston noted that Alaska recently became the first state to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Permitting Council for assistance through the FAST-41 program. She reflected, “It’s going to provide the accountability, the predictability, the reliability that projects need in Alaska… This will allow for investors to have some sense of reliability, that when they invest in a project, things are going to move forward.”

Tina Jeffress, group manager of sustainability and energy at Panasonic North America, emphasized the challenges of supply chain constraints and the importance of mineral processing. The company’s lithium-battery production facilities in Reno, Nevada, and De Soto, Kansas face difficulties as a midstream operation: “We can get the minerals we need, but we’re always trying to triangulate a really complicated formula between cost, location, carbon intensity, and some of those other responsibility factors, and so finding what we need, where we need to source from, at an appropriate price, is challenging.”

In terms of policy, Jeffress explained that longer-term incentives are essential for miners and refiners. For example, if the Section 45X credit is “a short-lived credit rather than a permanent one, I think it’s really hard for financing the mines and refineries that we want to see and that we need to see come online.” Albemarle’s Stroman added, “As we look for solutions and bringing processing back to the United States, it really takes a whole of government approach,” including public-private partnerships and trade agreements with other nations, because “if something isn’t done soon, it may be completely lost forever.”

Many of the companies are pushing forward with processing projects. Albemarle announced plans for a processing facility in Richburg, South Carolina, although it had to put the project on hold as prices continued to fall. Stroman expressed optimism for a “light at the end of the tunnel” due to the administration’s support for the sector, though. Panasonic, meanwhile, is working to secure sourcing and minimize supply chain risk, preferring the use of ‘carrots’ over ‘sticks.’ When it comes to recycling, for example, “I think there’s enough consumer attention there that if you put appropriate incentives in place, things would be moving a lot quicker,” Jeffress said.

Jean Simard, president and CEO of the Aluminium Association of Canada (AAC), also discussed recycling in depth. He explained that with every ton of aluminium, “we enable future generations to think, to design, to craft and to build the cities of tomorrow hundreds of years down the road.” He highlighted that approximately 1.5 billion tons of aluminium have been processed since the beginning of the industrial process in the 1880s, with 75% of that still standing in forms like televisions and washing machines in people’s homes. “Every time you remelt this aluminium, you only need 5% of the energy that was required to begin with,” he described. “So recycling is extremely important to us.” However, he acknowledged the need to influence consumer behavior at the end of product lifecycles to make sure the valuable material does not end up in landfills: “So you use taxes, you use mandates. It’s all stuff that requires very strong and well-coordinated policy making, and that’s the big challenge.”

Simard added that because the AAC represents Canada’s primary smelters and producers – including Rio Tinto, Alcoa, and Aluminerie Alouette – which are responsible for 80% of all primary aluminium produced in North America, trade between countries is essential for national security reasons. Canada ships 2.7 million tons of aluminium annually, equivalent to “four to six Hoover Dams, and it’s what is required to feed about 460 data centers to power AI.” The U.S., on the other hand, lost a significant portion of its capacity due to competition from China, which entered the market with lower prices. “Today, more than ever, we have to work together because the U.S. is in great demand for aluminium. For electrification, mostly because you need to build those transmission lines, which are using 100% primary aluminium for the lines. To have electric vehicles, you need to light-weight them with aluminium,” he explained.

Within the U.S., there also needs to be a focus on building out a workforce to advance these minerals and materials into substantial projects. South32’s Brown noted, “I think there’s a lot of ambition for critical minerals in the U.S., but I think we don’t have the right pipeline of people… So I think workforce development is critically important.” She pointed out that only about 100 mining engineers graduate in the country every year. South32 has already committed to an 80% local workforce for its Hermosa mine in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, where the company is teaming up with a local provisional college. Such efforts need to be escalated to meet the country’s energy demand.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/476433333_1194997582184606_3442388874212378128_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 10:59:59.889120

This project marks another successful collaboration between Vergent and Veregy, a NAESCO-accredited, energy services company (ESCO). The two companies first partnered in 2020 to bring a Capstone C65 system to Argos Community Schools in Indiana, a project that improved energy efficiency, lowered costs, and strengthened resiliency. Five years later, the project met or exceeded all of its energy conservation goals.

The new installations at VCS are the cornerstone of Valparaiso’s Phase 2 $17 million Guaranteed Energy Savings Contract (GESC). Phase 2 includes solar, retro-commissioning, and other energy efficiency upgrades. This Phase 2 project builds on the district’s earlier sustainability efforts, which have already generated more than $7.6 million in projected energy savings over 12 years through the use of solar arrays, LED lighting upgrades, HVAC enhancements, and real-time utility monitoring. Together, these efforts represent one of the most comprehensive K–12 energy efficiency programs in the state of Indiana.

“This Phase 2 project highlights how Valparaiso Community Schools is taking a holistic approach to energy efficiency and sustainability. The best kWh generated is always a kWh saved,” said Vince Canino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone Green Energy. “We are proud to see our technology becoming part of VCS’s evolving microgrid fabric - working alongside their solar, lighting, and HVAC systems. Our ability to help deliver resiliency, affordability, and sustainability in a learning environment is a source of pride, and we’re honored to support the next generation by innovating today for a cleaner tomorrow.”

Fueled by clean natural gas, the four Capstone C65 systems will provide reliable, low-maintenance, and quiet on-site power, an especially important feature given their proximity to classrooms. By producing both electricity and heat, the CHP systems will further reduce utility costs and support the district’s long-term sustainability and resiliency goals.

“This repeat order from Veregy shows that microturbines are not just a one-off solution; they are a cornerstone of a long-term energy strategy,” said Justin Rathke, President of Vergent. “Their quiet operation and reliability make them an ideal fit for schools, and their ability to generate on-site power and heat helps clients like Valparaiso reduce costs and build a more resilient energy future.”

This installation represents another successful deployment of Capstone technology in the education sector, where energy efficiency, sustainability, and cost savings are critical. By producing both electricity and useful heat on-site, the schools will reduce their environmental footprint while ensuring a resilient energy supply for students and staff.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-10-02 13:05:16+00:00,Inside Climate News,"Vehicle-to-Grid Power Is Becoming a Reality, But Why Isn't Progress Faster?","Dan Gearino, Aidan Hughes",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102025/inside-clean-energy-vehicle-to-grid-power/,"Electric vehicles use the large majority of the lithium-ion batteries being produced in today’s market.
I spoke with Willett Kempton, a University of Delaware professor who first wrote about the potential of vehicle-to-grid power in 1997.
Only recently, decades after that 1997 paper, have most companies involved in vehicle-to-grid technology adopted a common set of charging standards.
Sunrun is a key player in virtual power plants and it has several vehicle-to-grid projects, including the one in Maryland.
Donate Now Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe.","A Maryland utility is touting a project that allows owners of Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickups to send power from their vehicles to the grid and get compensated for it.

The Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. project is a partnership with Ford, the automaker, and Sunrun, a solar and energy services company. It’s the kind of thing that, if deployed on a large scale, could be transformative for the grid.

But the nagging sense I get when reading about vehicle-to-grid pilot projects is that this is an opportunity that remains largely untapped. The Maryland project, for example, involves just three trucks.

Electric vehicles use the large majority of the lithium-ion batteries being produced in today’s market. When those EV batteries are sitting in garages and connected to chargers, they become a potentially vast resource that can be utilized by the grid, generating income for the vehicles’ owners. But to realize this opportunity, utilities, automakers and regulators need to move beyond pilot projects.

Also, the market share for EVs needs to continue to grow, and the Trump administration’s cancellation of the tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying a new EV is a setback. The tax credit ended this week, and analysts expect it will lead to a decrease in EV sales at least in the short term.

I spoke with Willett Kempton, a University of Delaware professor who first wrote about the potential of vehicle-to-grid power in 1997. That paper, co-authored with Steven E. Letendre, who was then at Green Mountain College in Vermont, had a central idea that seemed almost like science fiction at the time, when EVs barely existed. The paper’s title sums it up: “Electric vehicles as a new power source for electric utilities.”

One of its key points was that the technology for using EVs to power the grid was pretty simple. Consumers would need to have bi-directional chargers, capable of sending electricity from the grid to the battery, and from the battery to the grid. And grid managers would need software to control the flow of electricity to the grid.

Kempton found that groups of EVs could send power to the grid and receive compensation that would help to offset the costs of owning the vehicle. There would be almost no negative effect on battery life or the vehicle’s readiness for use.

“The economics are really compelling,” he said.

Here’s some of the math he found exciting: If the United States could get to the point that one-fourth of its vehicles were EVs with bi-directional chargers, they would provide the grid with access to 660 gigawatts of capacity. That figure, from a 2005 paper he co-authored, was close to the total capacity of all U.S. power plants at that time. Since then, other researchers have conducted their own versions of this calculation using more recent variables, underscoring the vast potential.

The main stumbling block turned out to be the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards so that they would all be speaking the equivalent of the same language regarding how the system controls would work.

Only recently, decades after that 1997 paper, have most companies involved in vehicle-to-grid technology adopted a common set of charging standards. Now that the standards are in place, automakers and utilities have a much easier time setting up vehicle-to-grid programs than they would have before.

Progress is now happening with the development of laws and rules in the states and with pilot projects by companies such as Nuvve of San Diego, a leading player in vehicle-to-grid technology.

Nuvve’s U.S. projects include managing power from a fleet of electric buses in the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area.

At least eight states have recently enacted or introduced legislation or regulatory actions to foster vehicle-to-grid technology, according to the NC Clean Energy Technology Center. They are: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Delaware has been at the forefront, including the work of Kempton and his colleagues at the University of Delaware. Researchers there, sometimes in partnership with the utility Delmarva Power, have used vehicles from Nissan, BMW and other makers as part of various pilot projects.

One recurring theme across the states is that electric buses and fleet vehicles are a common early step for vehicle-to-grid technology because the batteries are large and they are often parked in a central location, making them easier to manage.

What I don’t see anywhere are projects with hundreds or thousands of residential EVs. In this way, vehicle-to-grid initiatives are not as far along as some of the efforts involving home battery systems used in virtual power plants, which are groups of batteries that work together to function like a power plant. Sunrun is a key player in virtual power plants and it has several vehicle-to-grid projects, including the one in Maryland.

Sunrun describes the Maryland initiative as the first in the country to use residential vehicles, as opposed to commercial or fleet vehicles. Last week, it announced that the vehicles had successfully sent power to the grid, after about a year of setting up systems to allow this to happen.

“In addition to showing how electric vehicles can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers,” said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell in a statement.

Beginning in July, the utility had the ability to use power from the trucks during the peak demand hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays. The vehicles’ owners get paid based on the amount of electricity they share, which caps at $1,000 for a period that ran from July to September, Sunrun said.

Sunrun has been working with Ford to develop programs such as the one in Baltimore. The long-term goal is to make it commonplace for an EV owner to be able to use their vehicle’s battery for backup power at home or as an income source by selling power to the grid.

Some of the most significant developments in vehicle-to-grid technology are happening in Europe. BMW announced a program last month in Germany where consumers could receive essentially free charging at home in exchange for allowing their battery to provide power to the grid when it’s connected to a charger.

In 1997, Kempton expected that this technology would be much further along than it is today.

“I thought the world was going to beat a path,” he said.

But he is optimistic that today’s pilot projects indicate a market on the cusp of something big. He notes that most of the new EVs coming onto the market have built-in capability for bi-directional charging, and many utilities are in some phase of integrating this into their grid management.

So, let’s see a utility do a vehicle-to-grid project with hundreds or even thousands of vehicles. And let’s see it soon.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

The Consumer Credit for EVs Has Ended. What’s Next? The tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying or leasing an electric vehicle is no longer available after the clock turned to midnight on Oct. 1, the result of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he thinks the sudden end of the credit could lead to a substantial contraction of the market, with EVs falling to as little as 5 percent of all new vehicles sold, about half as much as before, as Michael Wayland reports for CNBC. While it’s not much of a silver lining, the financing affiliates of Ford and General Motors have undertaken financial maneuvers that will allow those automakers to continue offering the $7,500 credit for leased vehicles at least until their current inventory is sold, as Mike Colias reports for Reuters. Analysts expect EV sales to plummet for the rest of 2025 as prospective buyers raced to make purchases before the end of the credit. What’s much less clear is what may be ahead in 2026 and beyond as automakers continue to introduce new EVs and the rest of the world is making a rapid shift to this technology.

States Are Key Battleground Now on Wind and Solar Permits: A new report tracks how states are taking a variety of approaches to issuing permits for new wind and solar projects, with some states adding restrictions and others reducing limits. According to the think tank Clean Tomorrow, 148 bills were introduced in the first half of this year that would make permitting more restrictive, while 89 bills were introduced that have a neutral effect and 68 would make it easier to get permits, as my colleague Aidan Hughes reports for ICN.

Solar Led the EU in Electricity Generation in June: Solar was the leading source of power in the European Union in June, generating 22 percent of the bloc’s electricity, which was slightly ahead of nuclear, as Pilar Sánchez Molina reports for PV Magazine. For the second quarter, renewable sources accounted for 54 percent of total electricity, up from 52.7 percent in the same period in the prior year. Denmark was the EU’s renewable energy leader, with 94.7 percent.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon found that the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) cap on state energy program funding is illegal. In New York, approximately $1.6 million in state energy program funding was at risk due to the DOE’s cap, which would have resulted in the elimination of 26 staff positions, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office.

In a ruling from the bench on September 30, Judge Mustafa Kasubhai granted the attorneys general’s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the DOE policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The core pieces of the act establish how federal administrative agencies make rules and how they adjudicate administrative litigation.

The court said the policy would have slashed reimbursements for staffing and administrative costs and threatened to cut millions of dollars for essential energy programs.

Last month, James led a coalition of 18 other attorneys general and two governors in a lawsuit to block the DOE’s attempt to cap reimbursement of administrative and employee benefit costs at 10% of a project’s budget. The attorneys general argued that DOE’s cap violated federal law, disregarded states’ negotiated cost rates, and would undermine staffing and operations for state energy agencies.

This funding also helps the state ensure that its energy systems can withstand extreme weather or disasters, determine how electricity prices and market rules are set, and run annual practice drills so the state can respond quickly if the power grid or fuel supply is disrupted. According to the lawsuit, without full federal support, the state could have potentially had to cancel or delay programs that enable it to meet energy demand while prioritizing affordability.

Joining James in this lawsuit, which was co-led by the attorneys general of Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon, are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

“Once again, my office has successfully stopped the federal government from illegally cutting off funding that New Yorkers rely on,” James said. “These programs help families save money on their energy bills, prepare their homes for extreme weather, and build a more resilient future. DOE’s cap on funding is unlawful and dangerous, and today’s ruling ensures that New York will continue to get the resources it needs to deliver cleaner, safer, and more affordable energy for our communities.”",https://lilifepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2161143267-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 11:00:04.407807

So in this time where the cost of living is a concern, we’re looking for ways to help our customers save money.” San Diego Community Power provides power for nearly 957,000 customer accounts for the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa, Encinitas, Imperial Beach and National City, plus unincorporated areas of San Diego County.","San Diego Community Power announced Wednesday a $55 million initiative that will offer rebates and incentives to encourage its customers to install solar-plus-battery systems in their homes.

“This is a win-win that reduces strain on the (electric) grid and makes energy more reliable for everyone,” said Colin Santulli, senior director of programs at Community Power. “The program benefits all ratepayers by supporting local energy development through a network of residential batteries.”

For customers who qualify for the Solar Battery Savings program, Community Power will offer upfront rebates on the installation of rooftop solar systems that are paired with battery storage. Customers who already have solar but don’t have batteries can receive rebates on the battery system they install.

The amount of the rebates vary depending on the size of the installation, but when Community Power launched a pilot program last year, it attracted about 1,600 participants and the average incentive came to nearly $7,000 per battery.

The program also offers customers a performance incentive when they discharge 50% of electricity stored by their batteries between 4 and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, when demand on the grid is at its highest and electricity prices are most expensive.

The weekday dispatch of 50% will result in a payback to the customer of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour.

“The board of directors of Community Power, building off the success of our pilot, has committed $55 million over the next five years to turn this into a full-time program,” Santulli said.

To be eligible, participants must be customers of San Diego Community Power, own a home in Community Power’s service area and commit to installing a new solar-plus-battery system or have an existing solar system in place.

To get started, go to SDCommunityPower.org/SBS and the website will connect customers to a list of qualified contractors in the area who can evaluate options, handle the paperwork and install the equipment.

“Small businesses are the heart and soul of San Diego and this program was built for family-owned businesses,” said Jake Marshall, operations manager for San Diego Greentech Renewables, a solar equipment provider that employs a staff of about 80.

The pilot program “gave San Diego contractors an opportunity to win against large national companies who outsource their labor and are headquartered in other states,” Marshall said.

Community Power’s Solar Battery Savings program comes as the 30% federal tax credit for residential solar, under Section 25D of the U.S. Tax Code, expires at the end of this year.

The cost of installing rooftop solar varies depending on the home, but the price tag can often reach $30,000.

But even with the federal tax credit sunsetting, Santulli said, “For most customers, installing a solar system with a battery is going to have long-term benefits to their bill over time. So in this time where the cost of living is a concern, we’re looking for ways to help our customers save money.”

San Diego Community Power provides power for nearly 957,000 customer accounts for the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa, Encinitas, Imperial Beach and National City, plus unincorporated areas of San Diego County.

It’s one of 25 community choice aggregation, or CCA, programs that have sprung up across California in recent years.

It did so as part of a lawsuit it filed April 2025 against the state of Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel. In May 2024, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced plans to sue unnamed oil and gas companies for contributing to climate change.

The case hasn’t been filed, but it triggered a legal counterstrike. The Justice Department sued Michigan in April, citing Michigan Capitol Confidential reporting in its argument that the state’s pending climate lawsuit would violate federal law. On June 20, the department asked the court to deny Michigan’s motion to dismiss the federal lawsuit for lack of ripeness.

Motion With Brief in Support to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction by mcclallen

Nessel asked the judge to dismiss the federal lawsuit because her office has not yet filed any climate-related lawsuits.

The federal government counters that Michigan’s attorney general has taken credible steps to file the lawsuit, including:

Publicly vowing to sue the fossil-fuel industry over climate impacts,

Issuing a request for proposals seeking firms to bring such suits,

Laying out a scope-of-work statement that targets producers in and outside Michigan for the global climate crisis,

Retaining three out-of-state climate-litigation firms to prepare the case “vigorously,”

Refusing to disavow her intent to sue energy producers in exchange for a Justice Department offer to end the federal suit.

The Justice Department argues that all this shows a credible threat that the suit “is likely to come to pass.”

Michigan signed contracts with three out-of-state law firms that specialize in climate: Sher Edling LLP, DiCello Levitt LLP, and Hausfeld LLP, CapCon reported.

The U.S. says its lawsuit is ripe now because there’s a credible threat. Any state of Michigan lawsuits that rely on state law would intrude on exclusively federal terrain, the Justice Department said. The federal government also requested a permanent injunction to enjoin such state-law claims.

“Michigan invites this court to make believe that its threatened suit might not raise the sorts of claims that the United States argues are preempted: state-law claims for damages related to global climate change, whether sounding in nuisance, consumer protection, or some other state law. But Michigan offers no reason to expect that theoretical possibility, and there is none.”

DOJ RESPONSE in Opposition to MOTION to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction by mcclallen

The court filing encouraged Nessel’s office to sue energy companies over state-law claims, such as nuisance, consumer protection, trespass, negligence, products liability, public-trust, etc, that “functionally regulate global or out-of-state greenhouse-gas emissions.”

The Justice Department brought five arguments to support its position: Clean Air Act preemption; constitutional limits on extraterritorial regulation; Dormant Interstate Commerce Clause; Foreign Commerce Clause; and the Foreign Affairs Doctrine.

“The lawsuits share a common feature: plaintiffs use state statutes and state common law to bring claims against global energy producers rather than using federal law. By framing their lawsuits under state consumer protection statutes or state common law claims, plaintiffs attempt to sidestep federal preemption arguments.”

Michigan promised money to law firms that are filing similar lawsuits in multiple other states, the Justice Department noted.

“The firm (Sher Edling) has filed the same type of materially identical lawsuit dozens of times, including for Massachusetts, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and more,” said the federal response to Michigan’s motion to dismiss. “Its complaints for the States—all of which are filed against major energy producers (e.g., Exxon Mobil Corporation)—allege materially similar state-law claims.”

The climate lawsuit could target fossil fuel industry defendants, including but not limited to extractors, producers, transporters, refiners, manufacturers, distributors, promoters, marketers and sellers.

Nessel’s office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, a judge in South Carolina tossed with prejudice a climate lawsuit city in that state filed against oil companies.

“If these lawsuits were successful, municipalities, companies, and individuals across the country could bring suits for injuries after every weather event,” the judge wrote. “The list of potential plaintiffs is unbounded. Moreover, under Plaintiff’s theory, there is no reason to limit the universe of potential defendants to energy companies alone.”

The Aug. 6 ruling in South Carolina follows unfavorable rulings against state attorneys general by judges in New Jersey and Maryland.

Nessel has waged a war on fossil fuels, Joshua Antonini, an energy and environmental policy researcher at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, told CapCon in an email.

""The Department of Justice is right to counter AG Nessel's thinly veiled policy-through-litigation masquerading as rights protection. The war on fossil fuels — that is to say, the war on the energy that makes modern life possible and affordable for everyday people — is bad policy, let alone a foolish lawsuit.""",https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/2024/sizes/1200w/MI%20oil%20and%20gas%20lawsuit.jpeg,N,,2025-10-02 09:59:13.009219

EV tax credits are dead in the US. Now what?

Federal EV tax credits in the US officially came to an end yesterday.

Those credits, expanded and extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, gave drivers up to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new electric vehicle. They’ve been a major force in cutting the up-front costs of EVs, pushing more people toward purchasing them and giving automakers confidence that demand would be strong.

The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. So what’s next for the US EV market?

His view also featured the soaring stacks of NRG’s coal- and gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station, which sits less than two miles from his door. The blip on his horizon did not bother him at first.

“I asked the real estate agent, ‘Did that present a hazard to the area?’ He said, ‘No, it’s clean-burning.’ So I didn’t think about it,” Wallace said.

Wallace didn’t have a way to double-check what was really in his air. Despite the county’s sharp population growth, Fort Bend has no official air pollution monitors set up by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

But a new Houston Chronicle analysis of air-quality data from PurpleAir – a company that provides lower-cost, community-installed air monitors – shows worrisome pollution levels in Fort Bend County near where Wallace lives.

Across the Houston metropolitan area, Texas regulators have 13 official air monitors capable of measuring tiny pollution particles. Within the same boundaries, more than 50 PurpleAir monitors take similar measurements, filling in gaps in communities like Wallace’s that lack the costly regulatory versions.

Recent annual averages from two PurpleAir monitors near the W.A. Parish power plant showed particulate matter levels exceeded newly tightened health standards for air pollution that were updated by the EPA in 2024, according to data analyzed by the Houston Chronicle.

The strengthened rules may not stick — federal officials promised this spring to revisit them as part of the Trump administration’s deregulation push. But the Chronicle’s analysis revealed that pollution levels recorded by TCEQ and PurpleAir monitors alike are on the rise.

In response to the high readings near the generating station, NRG spokesperson Erik Linden said that “there are many source categories that contribute to PM2.5 concentrations in the airshed,” and that the company is committed to complying with local, state and federal regulations.

Enforcement and permitting for both state and federal air emissions rules fall mainly under the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which said it is not able to assess the particulate pollution levels in Fort Bend collected by PurpleAir monitors.

“TCEQ does not perform modeling or other analyses to determine compliance with the standard in counties without regulatory monitors,” agency spokeswoman Victoria Cann said in a statement.

The EPA itself uses PurpleAir’s real-time data to illustrate national air quality. Asked why Texas environmental officials don’t use PurpleAir monitors to assess the region’s air against annual health standards, TCEQ spokesman Richard Richter said: “Low-cost sensors in general do not meet the stringent requirements outlined by EPA to be used for regulatory monitoring under the Clean Air Act.”

What’s in Fort Bend’s air?

Local research suggests the air near W.A. Parish is not benign.

A peer-reviewed study published in 2019 by Rice University scholars found the massive coal- and gas-burning power plant causes an estimated 178 premature deaths each year, mostly from fine particle pollution.

Some of those particles are released from the plant as soot, but many are byproducts of gaseous sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides in its emissions that mix with other molecules to form fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5.

Plant representatives have called the Rice research into question, but said they did not have the data necessary to check its specific conclusions.

PM2.5 can lead to heart disease and asthma, among many health problems, when the tiny fragments lodge in people’s lungs and cardiovascular systems.

State regulators at the TCEQ are responsible for tracking air pollution. If a community’s air quality is bad enough, regulators are supposed to make a plan to fix it.

But to make that decision, they only use data from their own costly, high-tech air monitors – the type that does not exist in Fort Bend.

At the end of last year, the state agency’s staff decided that Fort Bend should be one of 224 counties considered “attainment/unclassifiable” for federal particle pollution limits, meaning it would be off the hook regardless of its pollution levels given its lack of official monitors. This means Fort Bend residents will get no help from state regulators to bring pollution levels down.

Wallace has not done a deep dive on data gaps, but said he got scared when he first learned about the hazards from the coal plant in his backyard.

“You know, I don’t want my grandkids to get cancer, or me and my wife. That's a very real possibility,” Wallace said.

“The plant’s not going away. If they can't control this, then I'll have to move, for my family.”

Suburbs left out of air quality monitoring

The gap in regulatory monitors in Fort Bend worries some residents who say air quality is not being taken into consideration even as the county’s population balloons.

“New communities are being built right around some of the largest polluters in the country, specifically W.A. Parish,” local environmentalist Vero Piña told regional leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency during their visit to the area last year.

These regulatory monitors are heavily concentrated within Harris County’s borders and largely absent in the region’s sprawling suburbs.

Fort Bend is not alone. Four of the five Houston-area counties with the largest recent uptick in population – Fort Bend, Chambers, Waller and Liberty Counties – feature no regulatory air monitors at all.

Of the five, Fort Bend has seen the fastest growth, with the county population increasing by over 40% in the past decade.

Still, it can take years for a new state air monitor to be sited and installed, and even longer for that monitor to collect enough data that the state can start to use it for regulatory purposes.

“Monitors are placed in accordance with federal air monitoring requirements using population trends, reported emissions inventory data, local meteorological data, and, if available, existing air monitoring data for a given area,” said Richter, spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

In their most recent air monitoring network plan, TCEQ authors said the agency already has 69 monitors across the state that measure fine particulate pollution, far more than it is required to set up. They said federal law demanded only 40.

“The number, type, and location of monitors within the TCEQ federal monitoring network is sufficient to characterize air quality for all areas required within Texas,” the report said.

Texas has 254 counties, the most of any American state. Only 13% monitor PM2.5.

Information gaps and policy pushback

In Texas, air monitoring gaps are just one aspect of the stalemate between environmental groups and government officials over how bad the state’s pollution levels really are.

In 2024, Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over its update to an annual particle pollution cap under the Clean Air Act.

This update is based on a legally mandated review of health science. Federal officials considered everything from pollution-related deaths to economic impacts and decided to cut the annual average pollution limit by one quarter – pulling it down from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m³) to 9.

Though the Clean Air Act is federal law, it is up to individual states to enforce it. TCEQ staff began that process in the spring of 2024.

Abbott’s decision to call the new limit unlawful and say Texas was entirely in the green had immediate implications.

Any time a county or metropolitan area is out of attainment for a National Ambient Air Quality Standard over a three-year period, its state is required to take action. Texas would have started that process by developing a State Implementation Plan for federal approval; such a plan could take practical measures in a given county, like imposing new rules that limit emissions, or adding requirements for existing facilities.

Now, Texas will make no such plan in response to the new standard. But even if it did, the plan may have turned out differently than usual. While Texas has jousted for years with EPA staff over how transformational its plans need to be, new agency administrator Lee Zeldin has promised an approach that defers more readily to states.

“Clearing out the State Implementation Plan backlog will make significant strides to improving the air we breathe,” Zeldin said in a March statement.

Many local environmentalists disagree, worried that increased deference to states will nix the federal backstop that pressured Texas regulators for decades to be more strict on pollution.

Taking matters into the community’s hands

Piña, who serves as vice-chair of the local nonprofit Fort Bend County Environmental Organization, is one of the local and state environmental advocates worried about the data gap and state inaction.

They have spent the last few years trying to flood the Houston area with an alternative: A network of lower-cost laser particle monitors that residents can install on their homes and read themselves.

One common monitor brand Houstonians have set up is PurpleAir, the network used in the Houston Chronicle’s new analysis. The brand has a nationwide network of monitors that individuals can purchase and install, and the company then provides access to both real-time and historical data on particle pollution. The federal EPA even uses that PurpleAir data for a publicly available real-time tool, as does the Chronicle.

Even with the PurpleAir monitors, it can be difficult to know the causes of elevated PM2.5 in a given area. While two monitors to the northeast of Parish show annual average PM2.5 levels of about 9.6 micrograms per cubic meter for 2024, two other monitors to the northwest show levels below 9 micrograms. Variables like wind direction and humidity can have a substantial impact on where and how far PM2.5 travels.

A county needs only one regulatory monitor with average readings above the national standard to be considered out of compliance with the law.

Houston’s rapidly-expanding metropolitan area has seen pollution levels trending upward for the past several years, in a reversal of over a decade of gradual improvement.

Fort Bend is one of two Houston-area counties, along with Montgomery, that were marked as “unclassifiable” due to a lack of data by the TCEQ staff analysis in 2024, despite having one or more PurpleAir monitors with an annual average worse than the updated federal standard.

The threshold that these suburban Houston counties fail to meet may not be around for long, though. On March 12, the EPA’s Zeldin announced his agency would revisit the published rule as part of a historic effort to cut back environmental regulations.

While the federal agency periodically strengthens health limits for particulate pollution, it has never weakened the limit in an already-implemented regulation.

Zeldin said the decision would help “unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.”",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/0/0/0/0/24048704/1/rawImage.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 15:03:27.562633

Waste360: Why is lithium-ion battery recycling such a critical issue at this moment in time?
Crapps: Battery use is skyrocketing across EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage, and so is demand for the metals inside them.
Waste360: Looking ahead, what impact could this initiative have on the future of lithium-ion battery recycling in the U.S.?","As the use of lithium-ion batteries grows rapidly across electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and energy storage, so does the need for safe and sustainable recycling solutions. With millions of devices reaching end-of-life each year, the importance of keeping these batteries out of landfills and recycling streams has never been greater. To address this challenge, Redwood Materials has partnered with the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) and the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SC DES) to launch an education and awareness campaign promoting responsible lithium-ion battery recycling.

Leading these efforts in the Southeast is Morgan Crapps, Director of Public Affairs & Government Relations at Redwood Materials. In her role, Morgan oversees external affairs and works closely with public and private partners to build a closed-loop, domestic supply chain for lithium-ion batteries. Redwood, headquartered in Nevada and expanding into South Carolina, is pioneering a model that combines recycling, refining, and remanufacturing, all on the same continent, to return critical battery components to U.S. manufacturers.

In a Q&A with Waste360, Morgan shares insights into Redwood’s work with ESFI and SC DES on the Be Battery Smart initiative, explains why lithium-ion battery recycling is such a pressing issue today, and outlines how consumers, communities, and the waste industry can all play a role in building safer and more sustainable recycling practices.

Waste360: Can you start by describing the roles and involvement behind this lithium-ion battery recycling initiative?

Crapps: Redwood is working with ESFI and SC DES (as part of their Be Battery Smart initiative) on an education & awareness campaign that promotes responsible lithium-ion battery & rechargeable device recycling. This collaboration brings together Redwood, the largest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America, with ESFI, a national leader in electrical safety, and SC DES, South Carolina’s environmental agency, in their shared mission to raise awareness around lithium-ion battery recycling.

Waste360: Why is lithium-ion battery recycling such a critical issue at this moment in time?

Crapps: Battery use is skyrocketing across EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage, and so is demand for the metals inside them. Mining and refining are resource-intensive and often concentrated in regions with heightened geopolitical risk. Recycling keeps critical minerals, like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, in circulation and helps build a secure, domestic battery supply chain, while keeping batteries out of the waste stream.

Waste360: What risks do lithium-ion batteries pose when they end up in the trash or regular recycling streams? How serious is the fire threat at MRFs and landfills caused by improperly discarded lithium-ion batteries? What measures can waste and recycling operators take to help reduce the risks associated with these batteries in their facilities?

Crapps: Like most other batteries, lithium-ion batteries should not be disposed of in the regular trash or recycling bin. They should be recycled with specialized battery recyclers, such as Redwood, who have the expertise to safely manage and recycle them.

While lithium-ion batteries can cause fires if mishandled, the risk is often overstated. Like many materials in the waste stream, batteries pose hazards that are well-managed with proper handling. The difference is that these types of batteries are newer, so public awareness and infrastructure are still catching up. By educating consumers and building convenient recycling solutions, we can manage lithium-ion batteries safely—just as we’ve learned to do with other common household items.

Waste360: How do the drop-off locations created through this initiative operate, and how can consumers find one near them?

Crapps: There are multiple ways to recycle with Redwood. Redwood has over 40 drop-off locations in South Carolina, largely concentrated around the Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville metro areas, and hundreds across the country, which can be found here. Members of the public can also recycle batteries at their local household hazardous waste facility. In addition to drop-off locations, members of the public can ship their batteries directly to Redwood for recycling OR host their own event in their community to collect batteries & devices. Follow the instructions on our website for safe shipping or check out this article for more information on hosting an event.

Waste360: What types of devices and batteries are accepted at these collection sites?

Crapps: Redwood accepts rechargeable devices that contain lithium-ion or nickel-metal hydride batteries, such as:

Waste360: Beyond safety, what broader benefits does lithium-ion battery recycling provide for the environment, the economy, and U.S. energy independence?

Crapps: Recycling lithium-ion batteries and the rechargeable devices that contain them is essential for several reasons:

Waste360: Redwood reports a recovery rate of more than 95% for critical minerals. What happens to those recovered materials once they are processed?

Crapps: That’s right - Redwood’s technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of materials like nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, lithium and graphite in a lithium-ion battery. These materials can then go directly back into the supply chain to make batteries for new products.

Waste360: How does this campaign build on ESFI’s ongoing work around lithium-ion battery safety?

Lithium-ion battery safety is one of ESFI's key campaigns. Over the last few years, ESFI has been engaging the public, as well as working with partners like Redwood Materials, ReMA, and NFPA, to educate individuals on the proper sourcing, use, charging, and recycling of lithium-ion powered devices. As the world becomes more electrified and the demand for lithium-ion powered devices grows, ESFI is at the forefront of messaging to help consumers make safe choices, and Redwood Materials is an excellent partner for this. Lithium-ion powered devices are safe as long as they aresourced, used, charged, and recycled correctly.

Editor's note: This question was answered by ESFI.

Waste360: What role does the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services play in expanding this campaign’s reach and education efforts?

SCDES has been hard at work raising awareness of safety concerns and recycling opportunities through its “Take Charge, Be Battery Smart” public outreach campaign. Redwood and SCDES proudly partner on many initiatives to bolster battery recycling within South Carolina and SCDES even hosts a Redwood recycling location at its headquarters in Columbia.

Editor's note: This question was answered by SCDES.

Waste360: How can haulers, MRFs, and landfill operators partner with initiatives like this to improve battery safety and recycling rates?

Crapps: Please reach out to us at recycle@redwoodmaterials.com! We’d love to collaborate with you to set up collection sites, provide education, and find other solutions to get the word out about recycling.

Waste360: What best practices should waste industry professionals be promoting to help educate customers and communities about safe battery disposal?

Crapps: Professionals should encourage customers to tape terminals, bag loose batteries, and use dedicated recycling programs instead of tossing batteries in the trash. Sharing clear, consistent messaging helps build safer habits across communities.

Waste360: Survey data shows that more than half of Americans don’t know how to recycle their old lithium-ion devices. What barriers contribute to this lack of awareness?

Crapps: One of the initial barriers we often see is that many people don’t know they have lithium-ion batteries in the first place. Look around your home and chances are, you’ll find lithium-ion batteries everywhere. They power smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other portable electronics. They’re also used in power tools, cordless vacuums, and various smart home devices. Once people know how to identify these devices, they are more likely to make responsible decisions when it comes to safe disposal.

The equal treatment of ""green"" hydrogen made with renewables and other types of ""low carbon"" hydrogen would help companies accelerate their planning, Dercks said.","The German government has agreed on a draft law to accelerate the lagging expansion of hydrogen infrastructure. “Licensing procedures are too slow and too bureaucratic. With the hydrogen acceleration law, we will simplify them from the ground up, make procedures digital, and create more speed,” said economy minister Katherina Reiche. Crucially, the construction of electrolysers for hydrogen production, transport pipelines, and other infrastructure will be classified to be “of overwhelming public interest,” which will ease permitting.

The law covers onshore and offshore electrolysers, import terminals for hydrogen and its derivatives, storage facilities, and pipelines. “For decarbonising the shipping and aviation sectors, installations for producing synthetic fuels will also be covered,” the ministry added. Moreover, the ministry wants to facilitate the extraction of naturally occurring hydrogen deposits, sometimes referred to as ""white hydrogen"".

The windfall stems from the 45Q federal tax credit, which pays companies $85 per metric ton of CO2 permanently stored in geological formations or used in low-carbon products.

The incentive, expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and reaffirmed this summer in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” has become a cornerstone of US carbon management policy.

“Policy is key to scaling CCUS,” Jamie Burrows, He | RSS.com

A Growing Pipeline of Projects

EIP identified 17 industrial CCS projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquefied natural gas sectors that would qualify for the credit. Collectively, these projects estimate capturing 42 million metric tons of CO2 per year.

In total, Louisiana hosts 43 CCS projects and 10 CO2 pipelines in development, including 22 regional hub concepts designed to aggregate emissions from multiple industrial sites for shared transportation and storage infrastructure.

Some of the largest proposed facilities carry billion-dollar tax credit potential:

Ascension Clean Energy Facility (Ascension Parish) – With plans to capture 12 million tons annually, the site alone could generate $1 billion in credits each year.

Air Products Darrow Blue Energy (Ascension Parish) and St. Rose Blue Ammonia (St. Charles Parish) – Each could qualify for about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex (Cameron Parish) – Roughly $340 million annually.

Other projects, including Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex, Cameron LNG, and CF Industries/Mitsui Gulf Coast Blue Ammonia, could qualify for $85–170 million each year. Additional ventures such as Commonwealth LNG, Big Lake Fuels, and Methanex Geismar Methanol have not yet disclosed capture volumes, suggesting the total credit potential may rise further.

In a statement, DOE said the awards support 223 projects in its grid, renewable and fossil offices, as well as in the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains office.

DOE did not immediately provide a list of affected projects but said roughly a quarter of the awards were distributed between President Donald Trump’s reelection and inauguration day.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment,” Wright said in a statement.

One of the canceled awards is for the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California, according to a letter to grant recipients from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations viewed by POLITICO’s E&E News. The letter directed ARCHES officials to cease all project activities after Oct. 1. “Effective immediately, you may not incur any new project costs and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible,” the letter said.

In a statement, ARCHES CEO Angelina Galiteva said the decision “ignores the critical benefits our projects will deliver” but said projects would continue with help from state leaders and the private sector.

Bloomberg News said Tuesday the scrapped funding covers renewable projects and another hydrogen hub in the Pacific Northwest, according to an unnamed administration official. Pacific Northwest hub did not respond to request for comment Tuesday, but like ARCHES, it is a backer of wind and solar energy.

The two hubs were expected to receive up to $2.2 billion from the federal government as part of a nationwide network to demonstrate the transport and production of clean fuel. They were the first two hubs to ink a financial deal with the Biden administration last year.

There are five other hydrogen hubs slated to receive funding under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, including multiple projects that would demonstrate “blue” hydrogen using natural gas tied to carbon capture. Overall, the infrastructure law provided roughly $7 billion for the hubs. DOE did not respond to a request for comment about the canceled projects.

In the Tuesday evening statement, the department said award recipients would have 30 days to appeal a termination decision. Some projects already have appealed cancellations, it said.

In May, Wright released a memo outlining the process for a department-wide review, saying among other things that projects needed to be financially viable and aligned with administration priorities. Last week, Wright announced that $13 billion for clean energy projects was being returned to the Treasury Department, although those were unobligated funds called for the in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The new project cancellations were anticipated after White House budget chief Russ Vought said on social media Wednesday that the administration would cancel nearly $8 billion in energy projects in 16 states that backed former President Joe Biden in the November election.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from @ENERGY,” Vought wrote on X.

“The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA,” he said.

The comments sparked outrage Wednesday from Democrats, who said the cancellations are illegal and would raise electricity costs.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills. This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats–it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In an emailed statement, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a supporter of ARCHES, said pulling funding for the hydrogen hub is “vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) also told POLITICO that it’s “so stupid” to retaliate against Democrats when the result would be increased energy bills for all Minnesotans.

As senators were stepping into the Capitol on Wednesday morning, workers at EPA, the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior were entering their offices unclear about their employment status or their agencies’ ability to continue working on permits, studies and regulations.

National parks were opening their gates with skeleton crew staffing, and farmers across the country were wondering how they will be able to submit applications for federal funding.

The authorization for the National Flood Insurance Program had expired at midnight, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief funds were dwindling with no backup money in sight.

Each of those shutdown dynamics is affecting Americans across the country and across the political spectrum, but they were not immune from the partisanship raging on Capitol Hill as lawmakers continue to play the shutdown blame game.

“[Democrats] have stalled the work of FEMA and they have prevented people from renewing or getting new flood insurance programs right now in the middle of this,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) during a morning press conference.

“It is dangerous, it is destructive and it is unconscionable to us that Chuck Schumer should do this, and could do this, for his personal political reasons,” Johnson said, referring to the Democratic leader from New York, who on Wednesday led his caucus for a third time in voting against a short-term funding bill crafted by Republicans.

The Senate will be out Thursday for Yom Kippur but back Friday. Republicans plan to hold votes on that same funding patch Friday and over the weekend as a way to hammer Democrats for their opposition. The GOP has repeatedly rejected an alternative Democratic bill.

As that drama plays out, a bipartisan group of senators have been talking about a deal on health care subsidies, a major sticking point, though a resolution does not seem close at hand.

The White House said Wednesday that additional layoffs of federal workers was “imminent,” arguing such actions were needed during the shutdown. Two labor unions representing federal workers have already filed suit, calling the anticipated firings illegal.

President Donald Trump said his administration could use the shutdown to target Democratic priorities, and as Johnson and Republican leaders were getting ready for their press conference, the White House followed through.

Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the administration was freezing roughly $18 billion slated for major transit projects in New York City, the home state of Congress’ Democratic leaders.

Then, as lawmakers huddled on the Senate floor discussing potential offramps to end the shutdown, Vought posted on X that the Trump administration is canceling nearly $8 billion “in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” — with all of the funding being pulled from states that voted against President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats — it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.). “We’ve never had an administration work so hard to hurt the people they represent.”

‘Naked and brazen corruption’

Several Republican senators — including Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee in charge of the funding in question — declined to comment Wednesday afternoon, saying they did not know details about the cuts. Others were gleeful.

“Great!” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said on X.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote, “Good. END THE GREEN NEW SCAM.”

Democrats seethed at the announcement. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who authored the technology-neutral energy tax credits that Democrats enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, said Vought’s approach of singling out Democratic-favored forms of energy “is the opposite” of technology-neutral.

“It’s politics-driven: Single people out, make a big production out of it, try to flex your muscles if you have a question about some state,” Wyden said in an interview.

“He can make up whatever fantasy-land language he wants to use, but technological neutrality is going to be the future of what we do in terms of energy policy, and that’s not a scam,” Wyden said.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) suggested the White House action is illegal because it appears to blatantly restrict funding based on politics.

Vought said the impacted projects would be in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

“Were they a little more careful, they would have sprinkled in a Republican state or two,” Schatz said. “I do not think this will hold up in court.”

One victim was the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) called the move “vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance.”

One Democratic senator said the administration’s actions served as reason for Democrats to double down in support of their proposed funding bill. The Democratic continuing resolution contains language to prevent the White House from unilaterally canceling or repealing funds appropriated by Congress.

“Time to stiffen our spines and demand that we only fund a government that obeys the law,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who called the move to target only Democratic-led states “naked and brazen corruption.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said on a call with reporters Wednesday that the shutdown could hamper the administration’s stated goal of increasing energy production and lowering Americans’ electricity bills.

“This is an administration that says they want to expedite new energy facilities. It ain’t happening if there aren’t people to process permits,” Casten said.

Flood insurance: ‘huge impact’

Until the National Flood Insurance Program is reauthorized, current and prospective homeowners will not be able to renew or buy flood insurance, which in some areas is required.

The Defense Production Act — which presidents have used to boost domestic production of everything from solar panels and heat pumps to critical minerals and Covid-19 vaccines — similarly lapsed overnight.

The House Financial Services Committee has jurisdiction over both programs. Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) and other Republicans said Democrats were responsible for the shutdown and therefore the lapses in authorization because they voted against the GOP funding patch, which would have extended both programs. But Republicans voted against the Democratic funding patch, which also included those extensions.

“With Senate Democrats voting against this critical funding, the NFIP and DPA have now expired, hurting at-risk property owners across our nation and harming the ability for our government to speed up production of necessary supplies if there is a national security crisis,” Hill said in a statement.

Kennedy, who often tries to extend the NFIP ahead of its expiration, said he would not try to renew it this time because “it’s pointless.” He said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has “made it very clear” that he would object to a request for unanimous consent to reauthorize the program, as he has in the past.

Asked Wednesday if he would in fact object, Paul declined to comment. He has called the NFIP a federal subsidy for expensive beach homes.

The NFIP lapse “will have a huge impact on the housing market, which is already depressed,” Kennedy said. “Rand’s objection is silly, and he knows it’s silly, but there’s not much I can do about it.”

Disaster funding

FEMA’s disaster relief fund has about $5 billion remaining, per FEMA’s most recent funding report, but that balance could evaporate with the next major storm, and there would be nothing left over to cover other disaster costs.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) spoke about the need for more funding on the Senate floor Wednesday, a few days after the anniversary of Hurricane Helene’s rampage through his home state.

He noted that FEMA’s major-disasters account had about $1.4 billion remaining last month and that the agency approved $7.5 billion from that account the previous month alone.

The remaining funding “is dangerously low,” Tillis said.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re in a shutdown posture right now,” he said. “We are not prepared for another major disaster should it hit this weekend, nor do we have the money that we need to help communities across this country.”

Most FEMA and National Weather Service employees are typically excluded from furloughs during shutdowns, and agency employees have said they do not anticipate forecasting and response operations to be impacted by the shutdown.

Still, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee expressed alarm this week about potentially unforeseen impacts during the shutdown.

The Trump administration has “gutted forecasting offices and left out to dry the National Weather Service employees who work to keep Americans safe and informed in the path of severe weather,” said ranking member Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.).",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/50/49/1132d4ce4b78b4d3e3f124b1a0a9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2160963660,N,,2025-10-02 12:07:33.498953

Five of the new electric buses were introduced to the city on Clean Air Day, which meant free fares for all citizens. B-Line coincided with the launch of the new electric vehicles with a rebrand, including a new logo and website.

“Our theme right now is ‘Building a Better B-Line,’” BCAG Transportation Analyst Amy White said. “We’re naming each of our services so everybody will be able to differentiate which service they’re looking for.”

Along with the standard buses, B-Line will also introduce two more electric vehicle lines: B-Line Plus and B-Line Flex.

B-Line Plus is a rebrand of the existing paratransit service. B-Line Flex is a new “microtransit” service that White said will be introduced around springtime. White also added that they have their sights set on creating a Chico to Sacramento segment, which would be called B-Line Link.

B-Line began the launch with only five buses, which are only running in Chico for now, and White said the initial launch had a limited number of vehicles to see how they perform.

“It’s not a trial period, because we’re not getting rid of them, but we just want to see how they work and see what we can use them for,” she said.

BCAG Executive Director Andy Newsum said that they are trying to keep them under their range of 150 miles for now by keeping the buses in Chico, but said that they will eventually go farther.

“We want to first run them in Chico and make sure they deliver 150 miles or less per run between charges and see how they hold,” he said. “We’ll go farther if we get to a comfort level that we can go farther, and that might be some of the outer lines in Chico.”

The launch of the new electric vehicles comes after a 2018 regulation from the California Air Resources Board, which set a statewide goal for public transit agencies to transition to 100 percent zero-emission bus fleets by 2040.

Newsum said that while the clear benefit of switching to electric vehicles is that fossil fuels are no longer being burned, there is still a footprint when it comes to building batteries, as well as what happens to the batteries when they are no longer operational.

“Every technology has its pluses and minuses. For us, we’re going to be trading buying electrons for buying gasoline,” Newsum said. “Is that going to be good for us? We’ll see.”",https://www.orovillemr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BLINE-07.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-10-02 08:59:56.768576

(828newsNOW) — The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has awarded more than $1.1 million in grants for projects designed to cut air pollution from diesel-powered vehicles and equipment.

The Division of Air Quality announced $1.14 million in Mobile Source Emissions Reduction grants this week, including funding for one Buncombe County business and three in Swain County.

The program supports projects that replace or retrofit older diesel-powered vehicles with cleaner technology. This year’s awards will fund purchases ranging from electric utility vehicles and natural gas-powered trucks to new construction equipment that meets modern emissions standards. More than $270,000 of the funding will go toward new electric vehicles, according to DEQ.

The largest award — $289,380 to Cumberland County — will replace a box truck and two bulldozers with newer, more efficient models. Other recipients include Delta Air Lines, which received $268,248 to swap out six diesel belt loaders at Raleigh-Durham International Airport for electric models, and Waste Management of Carolinas in Buncombe County, which was awarded $120,000 to replace four diesel vehicles with near-zero emission compressed natural gas trucks.

Swain County companies receiving grants include Espinoza Hauling and Trucking Co. ($185,991), Fortner Contracting Inc. ($62,039) and HMC Paving and Construction Co. ($19,913).

The grants are funded through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, which targets pollution from diesel engines, a source of fine particulate matter and other pollutants linked to asthma, heart disease and environmental damage.

In 2023, the state program funded the replacement of 18 vehicles and cut more than 43 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions and 3,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the equipment.

More details on the grant program are available here.

Hopping over to the Halloween stores? Here’s what to know

Spirit Halloween

Spirit Halloween is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday-Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays.

Read about Spirit Halloween in last year’s feature on the store.

Spirit Halloween specializes in costumes of all kinds, but is particularly useful for finding easy outfits for recent pop culture staples, such as Smoke from “Sinners,” the suit from the new “Superman” or The Grabber from “The Black Phone,” a 2021 horror movie getting a sequel later this month.

The most iconic items offered at Spirit Halloween, however, are the animatronics. Every year, the Halloween pop-up builds an ISE, or In-Store Experience, an elaborate themed display filled with moving ghouls and scary sets. Last year, for instance, the store hosted a “Carnevil” display of haunted fair games. This year, the ISE is called “Madison Scare Park,” resembling a scary, dilapidated subway car.

Jim Farley, the head of Ford Company, expressed concern about the future of the electric vehicle market in the USA. He noted that this market may turn out to be significantly smaller than previously expected. Currently, electric cars account for 10 to 12 percent of the American automotive market, but the situation could change dramatically.

Impact of Tax Incentive Cancellation

The cancellation of the federal tax incentive for electric vehicles has significantly impacted the industry. Without the $7,500 incentive, Farley fears that demand for electric vehicles in the USA could drop sharply, and sales could be halved. This underscores how important this credit was for the country’s transition to electric vehicles.

During the “Ford Pro Accelerate” event in Detroit, Farley stated that electric vehicles might soon constitute only 5 percent of the total US automotive market, matching the 2022 level and significantly below the expected 10-12 percent this month. Such a forecast points to a more modest future for electrification than many experts had anticipated.

Industry Development Prospects

I believe it will be a viable industry, but it will be smaller, much smaller than we thought, especially considering the changes in tailpipe emission policy and the cancellation of the $7,500 consumer incentive. We will find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised if US electric vehicle sales drop to 5%.

According to Farley, the Ford Model e team is constantly analyzing the demand for electrified vehicles. The manufacturer will also have to adjust plans and decide how to utilize excess capacity for electric vehicle production and its battery plants.

Adaptation to New Conditions

We will fill them, but it will be additional stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy has changed. All of us will have to adapt, and I believe it will be beneficial for the country, but it will be another challenge.

During the same event, Farley also acknowledged that Ford’s customers are not interested in expensive electric vehicles. Therefore, the automaker needs to create cheaper electric models, but after the cancellation of the tax credit, this will become much more difficult.

Customers are not interested in $75,000 electric vehicles. They find them interesting. They are fast, efficient, you don’t need to refuel, but they are expensive.

These changes in policy and market conditions could lead to a revision of strategies not only for Ford but also for other automakers. The increasing costs of developing affordable models and the need to compete in a smaller market may cause structural changes in the industry, which will affect the pace of transportation electrification in the coming years.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mainstage-keynote-2-copy-1-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 10:59:46.663163

Offshore wind is one of the great UK industrial success stories. In just over a decade, we’ve gone from early adopters to global leaders - driving down costs, increasing deployment, and pushing into new frontiers like floating wind.

But we now face a familiar crossroads. The UK excels at early-stage innovation - the science, the pilots, the policy ambition. What’s missing is often the next step - the industrial follow-through.

If we’re serious about clean growth, resilience, and unlocking regional potential, we need to be just as committed to how we manufacture as we are to how we innovate.

We must make - and manufacture - more in the UK. We cannot continue to rely on others to deliver 50% of our future energy system.

From Policy to Production - The Test for UK Industrial Strategy

The UK’s net zero ambitions are now embedded in multiple government strategies - from the UK Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan to the Offshore Wind Industrial Growth Plan (IGP). Each recognises offshore wind as a pillar of our future energy mix.

The 2024 IGP identified offshore wind as a £25 billion opportunity for the UK economy by 2035, with the potential for over 100,000 new manufacturing jobs. Blades alone could deliver £6 billion in GVA over the next decade.

The challenge - and the opportunity - is to make sure those numbers translate into UK-made products, jobs, and supply chains.

Because without the investment to complete the innovation pathway - all the way through to late-stage R&D and industrial deployment - we don’t just risk losing the economic value.

We risk creating great research for others to commercialise, world-class innovation that delivers someone else’s growth. And that’s the difference between a transient industry - and a long-lived, sovereign manufacturing ecosystem.

Whole-System Thinking - Joining the Dots Across the Energy Transition

Industrialisation doesn’t happen in isolation. To make the energy transition real, we need to think about the whole system - not just how we generate clean energy, but how we turn that energy into products, supply chains, and economic value.

That means investing at every stage - from early R&D, to scaling up new technologies, to building factories and supporting long-term maintenance and operations. It also means making sure decisions are joined up across government departments, across regions, and across sectors - so we’re not solving problems in isolation.

Only by thinking across the full lifecycle - from ideas to infrastructure, and from deployment to long-term capability - can we turn innovation into industrial strength.

Floating Wind - and the Case for UK Manufacturing

Floating offshore wind is the litmus test. Projects are moving towards Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) by 2028. These will shape global supply chains for the next decade.

This is a pivot point - and a chance for the UK to lead in next-generation solutions, if we act now.

The components involved - blades, floating platforms, towers, cable systems - are some of the largest and most complex structures ever manufactured, often made of composites or hybrid materials. Their size makes local manufacture not just an economic argument, but a practical one.

If we want the UK to do more than host turbines - if we want to make the parts, build the platforms, own the capability - then we need to invest now in the skills, facilities, and digital tools that make this possible.

A New Kind of Industrial Strategy – Built on Execution

This is not about rewriting policy. The plans exist. What’s needed now is delivery - turning strategy into investment, and research into real-world production.

Programmes like TURBO, SusWIND , and our work with Vestas are already helping to pull innovation through into manufacturable, certifiable, and circular solutions. Digital twins, automated quality control, and AI-enabled design are reducing costs and compressing timelines.

This is exactly the kind of late-stage, applied innovation that UK industry needs - but it requires continuity, confidence, and coordination to scale. This is about product and technology leadership - not in theory, but in delivery. That’s how we anchor industry and supply chains for the long term.

The UK’s Competitive Advantage - If We Use It

We have the pieces - a strong R&D base, decades of offshore engineering experience, and proven industrial regions that are ready to grow.

The question is whether we can join the dots fast enough to turn that advantage into anchored supply chains, long-term capability, and sovereign resilience.

Final Thought

The next chapter of UK industrial strategy will be judged not by how well we wrote it - but by what we built.

Offshore wind gives us a chance to prove we can still scale innovation into production, and production into prosperity.

If we want clean energy to be a foundation of UK growth - not just decarbonisation - then we must finish what we start - investing in innovation, manufacturing at scale in the UK, and creating the conditions for system-wide leadership.

Because in the end, it’s not just about building wind turbines - it’s about building a future we own in the UK.","https://www.nccuk.com/media/pdkgiupc/energy-hero-offshore-wind.jpeg?rxy=0.9781502175202059,0.6693967239312825&width=1200&height=600&v=1dc313212e585f0",N,,2025-10-02 09:59:07.296474

Policy and legislation changes shaping the current energy landscape will require renewables to adapt. The increasing need for new generation after decades of relatively flat demand growth will also drive changes. The ability of renewable energy stakeholders to provide more timely and cost-effective solutions will keep clean power in the mix, albeit at a slower pace of uptake, at least in the immediate future.

At the same time, the climate will continue to be an existential issue and the United States needs steady jobs and resilient sources of clean energy. We will inevitably have the opportunity to change, reinvent or resurrect tax credits and other public incentives for renewable energy solutions. How should we use lessons learned from both the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act experiences to inform future strategy?

We offer a few thoughts and considerations:

Consider Partnering with Other Energy Markets (e.g., Oil and Gas) to Protect the Concept of Public Support for Public Goods, Including Reliable Energy

An effective partnership with oil and gas players would enable renewables to be viewed as complementary to baseload technologies and an important part of economic and energy security. It would also undercut the argument that renewables are too mature to warrant continued support. If the fossil industry receives financial support, renewables should too. Given that many “big oil” players are already invested in renewable companies, this may be a real possibility.

Consider the Rate at Which Tax Credits are Still Effective But are More Manageable for Budget and Messaging

Tax credits had a much more robust impact in the context of a 35% corporate tax rate. With the current corporate rate at 21% and many corporations unwilling to go lower than an effective tax rate of 15%, the demand for tax credits is not unlimited.

Constrained access to tax investors may be more acutely felt in middle-market deals. The added value and volume of tax investing after the IRA was and is highly concentrated in storage systems, very large installations and manufacturing plants.

Further, the credit adders increase the difficulty of finding budget “pay-fors” at the federal level and may increase unwanted political attention. The domestic content adder seems redundant in the face of FEOC requirements, and it is unclear that any of the “community” adders had the desired impact on communities, in large part due to the time needed to develop sites to the federal requirement and limited bandwidth at the IRS to review applications.

We suggest a smaller credit is more sustainable in the long run. A flat rate of approximately 25% may be a good compromise. It is more in line with other community development credits and would reduce the 10-year outlay for budget discussions while still promoting renewable uptake.

Broaden the Focus for Incentives and Support to More Than Tax Credits

Federal tax credits are but one of the incentives needed to move the market. State-based and regional programs have had great success. Renewable portfolio standards, community solar access, net metering and storage incentive programs are good examples.

The ability to transmit and deliver power is critical to all generating sources. The grid desperately needs investment to address access and reliability. Regional system operators and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should be targets of collective lobbying to encourage progress.

The federal, state and local requirements for construction permitting, interconnection and environmental reviews should be streamlined. Recent changes to the National Environmental Policy Act rules may help. An expansion of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act rules around priority dispatch to encompass installations larger than 5 MW would give some comfort to investors that small and medium deals have sales options for their power into the future.

The renewable community should support state and public utility programs that allow for net metering, protect renewable dispatch, guarantee access to transmission and delivery, and give benefits to low-income households.

In addition, a simplification of the federal accounting treatment for partnership investments would ease a barrier to entry for investors and developers alike. The recent introduction of proportional amortization was intended to help, but arguably made the rules more complex.

Review Experience with Various Tax Investing Structures

The current policy allows a range of investments to monetize renewable credits. This flexibility has proven useful for projects of varying sizes and market segments, each with distinct financing needs. We think the range of options should remain.

The options vary in terms of timing, return and complexity. At one end of the spectrum are sale-leasebacks, wherein the investor buys the entire project for a defined period. Then there are partnerships where ownership is shared and benefits are allocated on a negotiated split and for a defined period of time. The proportional amortization (PAM) option for partnership accounting became possible due to Financial Accounting Standards Board changes. PAM essentially allows the investor to buy into the value of tax credits and depreciation, but not cash, and can be rigid to implement. Finally, the transfer option is a straightforward purchase of the credits only–no cash or depreciation. As you progress through these options, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles accounting gets simpler and returns decline.

Market reactions over the past two years show that simplicity sells, especially at scale. Large investors looking to offset large tax positions trend almost exclusively to transfers, irrespective of lower returns. Investors looking for a more engaged option with higher returns may still invest in individual projects and portfolios of commercial and industrial and community solar through the sale-leaseback or partnership structures. The hybrid or T-flip structure allows for short-term equity (i.e., less than 10 years) to invest and then sell some or all the credits and depreciation. But the hybrid still ultimately relies on investors with tax appetite and may require a complex set of documents.

In summary: To achieve progress on practical, sustainable and effective public incentives for renewable energy, it’s essential to find the right balance of messaging, simplicity, coverage and return potential within an “all-of-the-above” power market.

There are certainly additional strategies and actions worth considering. We encourage all stakeholders to look forward to the future development of the energy market.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-10-02 07:58:41.390111

Now what? | MIT Technology Review,Casey Crownhart,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/02/1124603/ev-tax-credits-end-us/,"The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country.
To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs.
In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales.
And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.
According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions.","The tax credits’ demise comes at a time when battery-electric vehicles still make up a small percentage of new vehicle sales in the country. And transportation is a major contributor to US climate pollution, with cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes together making up roughly 30% of total greenhouse-gas emissions.

To anticipate what’s next for the US EV market, we can look to countries like Germany, which have ended similar subsidy programs. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably going to be a rough end to the year.)

When you factor in fuel savings, the lifetime cost of an EV can already be lower than that of a gas-powered vehicle today. But EVs can have a higher up-front cost, which is why some governments offer a tax credit or rebate that can help boost adoption for the technology.

In 2016, Germany kicked off a national incentive program to encourage EV sales. While the program was active, drivers could get grants of up to about €6,000 toward the purchase of a new battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.

Eventually, the government began pulling back the credits. Support for plug-in hybrids ended in 2022, and commercial buyers lost eligibility in September 2023. Then the entire program came to a screeching halt in December 2023, when the government announced it would be ending the incentives with about one week’s notice.

Monthly sales data shows the fingerprints of those changes. In each case where there’s a contraction of public support, there’s a peak in sales just before a cutback, then a crash after. These short-term effects can be dramatic: There were about half as many battery-electric vehicles sold in Germany in January 2024 than there were in December 2023.

Ultimately, it’s not terribly surprising that there are local effects around these policy changes. “The question is really how long this decline will last, and how slowly any recovery in the growth will be,” Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway who collects EV sales data, said in an email.

When I spoke to experts (including Andrew) for a story last year, several told me that Germany’s subsidies were ending too soon, and that they were concerned about what cutting off support early would mean for the long-term prospects of the technology in the country. And Germany was much further along than the US, with EVs making up 20% of new vehicle sales—twice the American proportion.

EV growth did see a longer-term backslide in Germany after the end of the subsidies. Battery-electric vehicles made up 13.5% of new registrations in 2024, down from 18.5% the year before, and the UK also passed Germany to become Europe’s largest EV market.

Things have improved this year, with sales in the first half beating records set in 2023. But growth would need to pick up significantly for Germany to reach its goal of getting 15 million battery-electric vehicles registered in the country by 2030. As of January 2025, that number was just 1.65 million.

According to early projections, the end of tax credits in the US could significantly slow progress on EVs and, by extension, on cutting emissions. Sales of battery-electric vehicles could be about 40% lower in 2030 without the credits than what we’d see with them, according to one analysis by Princeton University’s Zero Lab.

Some US states still have their own incentive programs for people looking to buy electric vehicles. But without federal support, the US is likely to continue lagging behind global EV leaders like China.

As Andrew put it: “From a climate perspective, with road transport responsible for almost a quarter of US total emissions, leaving the low-hanging fruit on the tree is a significant setback.”

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high-tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

Energy poverty remains a significant barrier to development, with millions of people across West Africa lacking access to reliable electricity.
The combination of clean energy, agricultural development and industrialisation is expected to generate a virtuous cycle of growth, job creation and improved living standards.","The ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) has announced the approval of more than USD 308 million in new financing to accelerate clean energy, industrial development and sustainable growth across West Africa. The decision was taken at the Bank’s 93rd Ordinary Session, held at its headquarters in Lomé, Togo, on 29 September 2025. The meeting was presided over by Dr George Agyekum Donkor, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who emphasised the Bank’s pivotal role in advancing inclusive growth and deepening regional integration.

Dr Donkor underlined that the newly sanctioned projects reflect EBID’s long-term mandate to strengthen economic diversification and stimulate sustainable development in the ECOWAS region. “Our focus is to provide catalytic financing that enables both public and private sector players to deliver transformative initiatives, building resilience and opportunity across the sub-region,” he said.

The funding package covers four strategic initiatives, spanning renewable energy, agribusiness, industrialisation and trade finance. Each project is designed to unlock new opportunities for economic activity while creating thousands of jobs, improving energy access, enhancing food security and supporting the region’s transition to more sustainable growth models.

Powering growth through energy and agriculture

One of the key facilities approved is a USD 40 million line of credit to Vista Bank Guinea, aimed at bolstering trade-related activities in the country. The funds will support import-export operations and strengthen commercial value chains, particularly in sectors critical to Guinea’s economic base. EBID estimates that approximately 105 enterprises will benefit directly, with significant spill-over effects across supply chains and local communities. The initiative is expected to generate and sustain several thousand direct and indirect jobs, contributing meaningfully to inclusive growth and helping to reduce unemployment, particularly among young people and women.

The largest single project approved during the session is the financing of a 50 MW Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant in Taraba State, Nigeria, with an allocation of USD 98.18 million. This project addresses one of the most pressing constraints to development in the region: access to reliable, affordable and clean electricity. By expanding Nigeria’s renewable energy capacity, the plant will contribute to reducing energy poverty, stimulating inclusive economic activity and promoting environmental sustainability. The project is forecast to provide direct electricity access to around 390,000 individuals, while also improving power reliability for at least 200 public institutions such as schools and hospitals. Beyond the social benefits, the project will create an estimated 400 direct jobs during the construction phase and around 50 permanent operational roles. In addition, between 1,200 and 1,500 indirect jobs are expected to be generated across supply chains, maintenance services and small businesses linked to the plant’s operations.

Agriculture and food security also feature prominently among EBID’s latest approvals. A total of USD 79.219 million has been allocated for the development of a modern rice processing complex and a 10,000-hectare irrigated rice production unit in Taraba State. Nigeria’s ambition to become self-sufficient in staple food production is given a further boost by this project, which aims to significantly enhance local rice output, reduce reliance on imports and improve value addition in the agricultural sector. By combining large-scale cultivation with modern processing facilities, the initiative is expected to strengthen food self-sufficiency, support smallholder farmers and create rural employment, while laying the foundation for a more resilient and competitive agro-industrial sector in Nigeria.

Industrialisation and regional impact

Closely linked to this is the financing of a new industrial park in Taraba State, valued at USD 91.232 million. The park has been conceived as a modern, integrated industrial ecosystem designed to accelerate local industrialisation and promote economic diversification. By attracting investment, nurturing entrepreneurship and enabling the clustering of industries, the facility is expected to stimulate manufacturing, create thousands of jobs and support the development of new value chains in the state. For Nigeria, which has long sought to diversify its economy beyond hydrocarbons, the industrial park represents a significant step towards building a more dynamic and competitive industrial base.

Taken together, the four projects demonstrate EBID’s holistic approach to development financing, with a strong emphasis on sustainable growth, private sector engagement and regional impact. They are also closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The rice production and processing complex directly advances SDG 2 on Zero Hunger by boosting food security and reducing dependence on imports. The solar power plant supports SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, while also contributing to SDG 13 on Climate Action by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The industrial park underpins SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, while the Vista Bank line of credit promotes SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth.

For Dr Donkor, these investments are more than just individual projects; they are part of a broader strategy to transform West Africa’s economic trajectory. “Each of these initiatives has been carefully designed to deliver measurable impact across multiple fronts – from reducing poverty and unemployment to addressing climate change and enhancing food security,” he noted. “By aligning our operations with the SDGs, we are ensuring that EBID’s work contributes not only to the prosperity of the region but also to the achievement of global development priorities.”

The financing approvals also reaffirm EBID’s growing role as a key development partner for ECOWAS member states. Since its creation, the Bank has played an instrumental role in funding projects that enhance integration, stimulate trade and improve livelihoods across the region. In recent years, EBID has increasingly prioritised projects with high sustainability credentials, reflecting the global shift towards climate-conscious development finance.

By targeting sectors such as renewable energy and agribusiness, the Bank is helping to address structural challenges that have historically held back the region’s economic transformation. Energy poverty remains a significant barrier to development, with millions of people across West Africa lacking access to reliable electricity. Similarly, food insecurity and dependence on imports continue to expose the region to external shocks, from fluctuating global commodity prices to supply chain disruptions. EBID’s latest approvals directly respond to these challenges by financing home-grown solutions that build resilience and strengthen regional self-sufficiency.

The focus on Taraba State in Nigeria is particularly noteworthy, as it reflects EBID’s commitment to supporting projects that can serve as models for replication across the region. By financing a solar power plant, a rice production complex and an industrial park within the same state, the Bank is creating synergies that could amplify impact and demonstrate how integrated investments can catalyse local transformation. The combination of clean energy, agricultural development and industrialisation is expected to generate a virtuous cycle of growth, job creation and improved living standards.

Looking ahead, EBID’s success will depend not only on its ability to mobilise financing but also on its capacity to ensure effective implementation and long-term sustainability of projects. The Bank’s emphasis on partnerships with both public and private sector actors will be critical in this regard, as will its continued alignment with regional and global development agendas.

As West Africa seeks to navigate the complex challenges of economic diversification, climate change and demographic growth, institutions like EBID are set to play an increasingly important role. The approval of USD 308.631 million at its latest board session underscores the Bank’s ambition to remain at the forefront of the region’s development journey. By investing in projects that combine economic, social and environmental benefits, EBID is helping to lay the foundations for a more prosperous, resilient and sustainable future for the ECOWAS region.",https://african.business/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img-20251001-wa0041.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 05:59:29.572677
