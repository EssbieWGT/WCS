— Senate Finance to release “big, beautiful bill” changes

— Scoop: Hospitals back megabill Medicaid plan

— Senators to get post-Minnesota security briefing

Senate Finance is expected to reveal at least some of its tweaks to the House-passed “big, beautiful bill” today, but the panel’s text will likely include placeholders for key Medicaid and tax provisions as negotiations continue.

Chair Mike Crapo will brief Senate Republicans on his proposals around 6 p.m., three people granted anonymity to share the unannounced plans told Jordain.

Expect the state-and-local-tax deduction to be one of the TBDs as GOP senators continue to hash out how much they want to roll back the House’s $40,000 SALT cap.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune teased a “compromise position” on SALT in a pre-taped Fox News Sunday interview. He said there “isn’t a high level of interest” among senators to follow the House in quadrupling the $10,000 limit that’s in law today.

Thune insisted that President Donald Trump’s tax priorities — no taxes on tips and overtime — will be “incorporated” in the Senate’s version of the megabill, despite Senate Republicans’ desire to trim them in favor of making business tax incentives permanent.

A person granted anonymity to discuss the negotiations tells Jordain that Senate Republicans still plan to make those business tax provisions permanent — a win for Thune, Crapo and other Finance members.

With the Senate out Thursday and Friday, this shortened week will be key for sending the bill to Trump’s desk by July 4. The Senate parliamentarian will have bipartisan discussions with committees, and staffers anticipate she will start issuing rulings now that nearly every committee has released text.

A few other megabill developments:

— Trump and Rand Paul talk it out: Paul told NBC News that the two spoke Saturday, after Trump spent weeks attacking the Kentucky Republican for signaling he’d vote against the bill. Paul, who has objected to the bill’s debt-ceiling increase, said he told Trump he’s “not an absolute no” and that the two are “trying to get to a better place in our conversations.” But he also indicated that Republicans are spending little energy in really trying to win him over.

— What Mark Meadows is doing behind the scenes: The former House Freedom Caucus chair and one-time Trump chief of staff is operating as a sounding board for conservatives as they try to hang onto some of their biggest priorities in the megabill, Jordain and Meredith Lee Hill report. Meadows huddled with House and Senate hard-liners last week, and is in regular contact with House Freedom Caucus members.

“Mark is trying to help get a deal done,” Sen. Rick Scott said.

THE SKED

The House is out.

The Senate is in session and voting to end debate on Gary Andres’ nomination to be an assistant secretary of HHS at 5:30 p.m.

— Intel will have a closed briefing at 4 p.m.

— Senate Republican and Democratic leadership will hold private meetings shortly before evening votes.

— Crapo will brief the Senate Republican Conference on the Finance portion of the megabill after votes around 6 p.m.

The rest of the week: The Senate, which is in through Wednesday, will take up stablecoin legislation and work through Trump’s nominations, including Olivia Trusty to be a member of the FCC. The House is out all week and will return next Monday.

THE LEADERSHIP SUITE

Senate leaders to convene security briefing after Minnesota shooting

Senators will receive a classified security briefing Tuesday morning from the chamber’s sergeant at arms and the Capitol Police, Jordain scooped, after a Saturday shooting killed and injured Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. The suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, was arrested late Sunday, per The Associated Press.

The internal announcement Sunday from Thune about the bipartisan briefing came after GOP senators and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested one. Schumer said he also obtained extra security for Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, as well as Sen. Alex Padilla after the California Democrat was forcibly removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s Los Angeles press conference last week.

“We have to reevaluate how we are protecting members of Congress and staff in the face of rising threats,” Schumer said Sunday.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday he also asked the Capitol Police and the House sergeant at arms to ensure members’ safety.

The rise in political violence is rattling members on both sides of the aisle, many of whom have experienced threats. Speaker Mike Johnson called the Minnesota incident “horrific” and urged lawmakers to “unequivocally condemn it” in a post on X. Exactly eight years ago to the day of Saturday’s shooting, Majority Leader Steve Scalise was shot and wounded during a congressional baseball practice in Virginia.

POLICY RUNDOWN

FIRST IN INSIDE CONGRESS: HOSPITALS GIVE GOP GREEN LIGHT ON MEDICAID CHANGES — Senate GOP leaders are getting some outside help as they try to find a landing spot on the megabill’s Medicaid revamp and the provider tax, which several states use to help fund their Medicaid programs.

Hospital associations from 13 states sent a letter to Thune and Crapo, a copy of which was obtained by Jordain, urging them to “move forward with the carefully negotiated Medicaid provider tax-related and Medicaid directed payment program provisions in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill.”

The states represented in the letter include several with red-state senators like Jim Justice and Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt from Missouri and Thom Tillis from North Carolina. (Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins has raised concerns about rural hospitals and the impact of a provider tax freeze, is not represented on the letter.)

The call to hold the line on the House language comes as some Senate conservatives have floated going further and rolling back the provider tax, something that would likely cause heartburn with both House and Senate moderates and rural-state lawmakers. But the hospital associations warned that “additional changes to seek further cuts through these Medicaid provider tax-related provisions would jeopardize the fragile balance that has been struck and threaten the healthcare safety net in our communities.”

GOP SCRUTINIZES TRUMP’S HOUSING MOVES — GOP lawmakers and the mortgage industry are questioning the Trump administration’s plans to maintain government control over much of the nation’s housing finance system, defying expectations that it would back off, our Katy O’Donnell reports.

Trump surprised the industry late last month by pledging to take public Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled companies that stand behind half the $16 trillion residential mortgage market, while preserving an implicit federal guarantee for their solvency. It’s causing a rift among Republicans, including among some administration aides who have long worked to reduce the government’s footprint in the housing market.

“I want to get [Fannie and Freddie] out of conservatorship,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, chair of the Senate Banking subcommittee with oversight of the mortgage giants. “But I want to be very careful about how we do it, because we need the secondary [mortgage] market, and we need it to work.”

CAMPAIGN STOP

FIRST IN INSIDE CONGRESS: NEW CANDIDATE IN MI-10 — Tripp Adams, an Army and Navy veteran who’s served as CEO of a health tech startup, is joining the crowded Democratic field in Michigan’s 10th District as GOP Rep. John James runs for governor.

Democrats are making the district one of their top targets to flip in 2026; it includes parts of Macomb and Oakland counties and is among the more competitive in the state. Adams is looking to lean on his service record to differentiate himself from the pack, billing himself in a statement as part of a “new generation of patriotic leadership.” It’s part of a growing trend of Democrats looking to play up their military backgrounds as the party tries to separate patriotism from MAGA.

The clean energy tax credits in question were enacted by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The budget bill is now being considered by the U.S. Senate, where the energy tax credits have been central to conversations and debate.
He said opportunities to grow the state’s economic resources is a good thing, and the tax credits would help to incentivize such growth.
“We all know what can be possible in West Virginia,” Carmichael said.","Mitch Carmichael, the former secretary of economic development in West Virginia, is spearheading a new ad campaign urging President Donald Trump to preserve energy tax credits that he says are vital to creating jobs and growing business in West Virginia.

The clean energy tax credits in question were enacted by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. House of Representatives voted last month, while considering the massive government spending bill, to cut them. West Virginia Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore both voted in support of the bill.

The budget bill is now being considered by the U.S. Senate, where the energy tax credits have been central to conversations and debate. If the bill in its current form is passed, billions of dollars in incentives for clean energy and alternative energy projects in communities across the country would come to an end, potentially taking thousands of jobs along with them.

Carmichael is working on the new campaign as the executive director of Built For America, a group recently formed specifically to advocate for and protect the energy tax credits. He said the organization decided to target Trump with its message instead of Congress because he is “certain” that the president will understand where the group is coming from.

“We believe that Donald Trump will do the right thing and will see the commonsense here,” Carmichael said. “These tax incentives represent basically the quintessential American Dream: Companies and individuals doing something well, investing in communities, and being rewarded for that. We believe that he will agree.”

Environmentally focused advocacy groups have been sounding the alarms regarding potential cuts to the tax credits for months, warning that — if they end — businesses, communities, consumers and the environment will be worse off.

“We’re not coming at this from a climate ideology,” Carmichael said. “We are focusing on how these tax credits are job makers, they’re essential to growing the manufacturing industry [in places like West Virginia] and they’re based on real, actualized outcomes — not politics.”

The credits at risk give companies incentives to either start new projects based around clean energy or convert current energy sources into clean energy, like solar, wind, geothermal and more. They also provide direct benefits to consumers through credits for buying electric vehicles or installing solar panels on a home.

Carmichael said in West Virginia these credits have already been instrumental in recruiting investments from companies for large manufacturing projects. Specifically, he pointed to the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company project in Ravenswood, where a solar microgrid is powering the manufacturing of titanium products, and the Form Energy’s iron air battery manufacturing site in Weirton.

The Berkshire Hathaway project represented a $500 million investment in the Jackson County town. In Weirton, 300 people are currently employed at the Form Factory 1.

“Those investments happened in large part because of these tax credits,” Carmichael said. “We need more companies like this and we need more projects like this. These incentives help us make that happen.”

Carmichael, who also served as the state Senate president from 2017-2021, was clear that the point of these projects is not to “put coal [or natural gas] out of business.” Instead, he said, the investments allow the state to diversify its economy by exploring and inviting in industries previously not here.

And those industries, Carmichael said, create jobs — something he knows firsthand is difficult to do in the state.

In one of his first acts as governor in January, Patrick Morrisey announced his plans for a “Backyard Brawl” to make West Virginia economically and financially competitive with surrounding states. Though that plan so far has largely included cutting taxes and “red tape” in the hopes of incentivizing businesses to locate in West Virginia, Morrisey said in January that energy infrastructure will be core to the initiative.

This legislative session, a critical piece of legislation was passed to introduce a new industry — data centers — into the state.

House Bill 2014 created a certified microgrid program within West Virginia state code. Under the law, data centers will be allowed to form microgrids to generate their own power instead of hooking up to already existing utilities. Initially, the bill required that the microgrids be powered through renewable energy. But a change to the bill during session opened that up to any form of energy, including coal and natural gas.

The bill — and the new tax structure created within it for the distribution of taxes collected on such sites — have been somewhat controversial. Residents in places like Tucker County, where a natural gas-powered data center is proposed, are upset that the legislation allows private companies to completely disregard local zoning ordinances, robbing them of any chance they’d have to protect their community from the worst consequences of industrial sites.

But Carmichael said he was excited to see what’s accomplished under the law. He said opportunities to grow the state’s economic resources is a good thing, and the tax credits would help to incentivize such growth.

“We all know what can be possible in West Virginia,” Carmichael said. “These tax credits make it so these large companies have more of a reason to look to us when they’re trying to grow their businesses. That’s what we need here.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mitch-Carmichael.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 08:04:20.789757

The region could also be in violation of standards on particulate matter, said Chris Klaus, senior air quality program manager for the North Central Texas Council of Governments.
Aside from the state environmental commission’s air quality plan, the council of governments is drafting the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan.
Since 2023, air quality officials have been working on the plan that addresses projected emissions and identifies practices to improve air quality through 2050.
Through public meetings and surveys, Dallas-Fort Worth residents cited concerns about lack of public transportation, climate change and local air quality.","For several years, Dallas-Fort Worth has failed to keep major air pollutants at or under federal limits.

In order to avoid millions in fines, North Texas air quality planners are prompting industrial groups and businesses to take action to mitigate emissions.

Sixteen oil and gas companies make up some of the major sources of air pollution in Tarrant County, accounting for 6% of nitrogen oxide emissions across 16 counties in North Texas, according to data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Nitrogen oxide is one of the two gases that leads to the formation of ozone, a harmful gas that can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.

Through the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has outlined limits on six major sources of air pollution, including ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.

While Dallas-Fort Worth has kept most of those pollutants under the EPA’s limits, the region has long lagged and continues to fail to meet federal standards on ozone.

The region could also be in violation of standards on particulate matter, said Chris Klaus, senior air quality program manager for the North Central Texas Council of Governments.

As of data collected June 9, the Dallas-Fort Worth region’s ozone levels for 2023 to 2025 so far stand at 79 parts per billion. The EPA caps ozone at 70 parts per billion.

Industrial entities, such as power plants, refineries and cement plants, would bear the burden of federal fines if levels don’t meet federal limits.

“If we continue to not be able to reach attainment, then there’s going to be fees and penalties prescribed through the Clean Air Act against point sources or (industries),” said Klaus.

The council of governments projects those fees would come out to $45 million, if ozone levels are not brought down to be at or below 75 parts per billion by 2027.

Measures to minimize air pollutants

In a June 10 meeting, air quality planners with the council of governments, the agency tasked with monitoring air quality in the region’s 16 counties, proposed an array of best measures for businesses in order to minimize air pollutants, particularly ozone.

Measures include recommendations outlined by the Comprehensive Roadmap to Reduce Emissions. The plan is under development by the state environmental commission through the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program in an effort to improve air quality across the state, said Savana Nance, principal air quality planner for the council of governments.

The plan recommends industrial sources turn to low emissions alternate fuels such as hydrogen; use carbon capture and storage technologies; and adopt ultra-low global warming potential refrigeration technologies that use natural refrigerants with shorter atmospheric lifetimes.

For oil and gas businesses, the state plan recommends business entities regularly replace motors and pumps, reduce flaring and capture methane emissions, and install more monitors to limit unintended emissions.

State regulators urge other commercial businesses or other entities largely contributing to air pollution to include equipment to capture methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment plants, transition to solar energy, and add recycling equipment to reduce waste.

Potential funds to help

The plan points out federal and state funds to help North Texas polluters put the best practices into action.

One of the funding programs is the Industrial Training and Assessment Centers. The development center offers grants to help small- to medium-sized manufacturing companies become energy efficient and reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions.

Also outlined in the plan is the state environmental commission’s Texas Voluntary Marginal Conventional Well Plugging Program. The grant program assists oil and gas well owners to transition from conventional wells to well plugs.

Well plugging involves placing a seal in low-producing oil and gas wells, which have been known to significantly contribute to methane and other air pollutants, according to the EPA.

“There are great programs that have a decent amount of funding that we encourage everyone to check out,” said Nance.

Aside from the state environmental commission’s air quality plan, the council of governments is drafting the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan. Since 2023, air quality officials have been working on the plan that addresses projected emissions and identifies practices to improve air quality through 2050.

In a June 5 meeting, Nance and air quality planner Irlenia Hermosillo said the council of governments is working to add more measures focused on emissions generated through transportation.

Through public meetings and surveys, Dallas-Fort Worth residents cited concerns about lack of public transportation, climate change and local air quality. This prompted the council of governments to home in on all contributing sources of air pollution.

“This reinforced our decision to make sure that the (air quality improvement plan) was comprehensive and addresses criteria pollutants and (greenhouse gases),” Hermosillo said at the meeting.

Loans, economic incentives

Apart from preventive measures and grants, the council of governments discussed opportunities around loans and incentives to get businesses to do their part in managing emissions.

Through the Property Assessed Clean Energy program, commercial, industrial and multifamily property owners can take out loans to finance low-cost energy efficiency and water conservation projects through voluntary assessments made on a property.

This would help property owners see significantly lower utility costs, said Lori Clark, senior program manager at the council of governments.

A slew of tax credits for clean energy-aligned projects for businesses and industries are available, too, said Clark.

Thanks to the $369 billion in tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses can see larger tax returns through an array of projects including clean transportation, electric vehicles and clean energy usage.

Clark emphasized the opportunity to meet with businesses or industrial facilities should business leaders need more information or assistance on applying for programs and funding.

“This is really just an educational opportunity that we wanted to make available for everybody.”

The House of Representatives’ proposal to rescind billions in clean energy tax credits and claw back unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds has further chilled investor confidence.
Developers are pausing contracts, and clean energy projects, which help improve the resilience and efficiency of our energy system, are in limbo.
According to E2, a nonpartisan group representing business leaders, more than 13,000 clean energy jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2025, largely because of delays and uncertainty.
A national transmission strategy must be a cornerstone of economic policy to integrate clean energy generation, large-scale batteries and flexibility.","Most Americans don’t think about infrastructure unless it fails. But when it does, it’s personal. When subways stall or highways clog, you’re late for work. When a bridge closes, your commute reroutes into chaos. When the storm drain overflows, your basement floods. And when transmission lines fail, the power goes out, leaving homes sweltering, grocery shelves empty and businesses offline.

Weak infrastructure makes your life just a little bit worse.

The United States is sleepwalking into an infrastructure crisis — one that will quietly degrade our quality of life and kneecap our ability to compete in the global economy. It’s not just the older infrastructure that’s in need of repair and replacement; it’s also support for the new systems, such as artificial intelligence.

The crisis calls for a national recommitment to modernization — not as a partisan project, but as a precondition for global competitiveness, national security and basic dignity in daily life. And while responsibility ultimately lies with Congress, it’s also with all of us who understand the stakes.

Today, the average U.S. bridge is over 40 years old, and about 42,000 of them are structurally deficient. Our ports are among the least automated in the industrialized world, leading to higher costs and dangerous pollution in nearby communities.

And America’s grid is stretched thin. In the wintertime last year, about two-thirds of the country faced elevated risks of blackouts, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. We can’t move electricity from areas with excess capacity to where it’s needed because we haven’t built enough transmission lines. And in a world increasingly powered by machine intelligence, if your power goes out, your economy goes offline.

The demand for electricity is rising fast. Training a single large-scale A.I. model now requires as much electricity as a large, urban American neighborhood uses in a year. Data centers, which power everything from those language models to advanced simulations, are projected to consume about 10 percent of the U.S. electricity supply by 2030 — up from around 2 percent today. A new report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation finds that these facilities are an emerging threat to grid stability because they pull huge amounts of power at unpredictable times. The grid wasn’t built for this. Unless we expand energy generation and build out transmission aggressively, the lights will start to flicker on our future prosperity.

Shaky infrastructure isn’t just a problem for the tech sector. As the United States scrambles to bring back manufacturing, the infrastructure undergirding it is nowhere near ready. More than 920 new or expanded manufacturing facilities have been announced since 2021, projects to make semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals processing and other components here at home.

For a moment, it seemed like America was serious about modernizing its infrastructure: The Biden administration tried to accelerate permitting, improve transmission planning and unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding for upgrades. There was real momentum.

Since then, the repeated brinkmanship over government funding and debt ceilings — and short-term budget deals that gut long-term investments — have thrown these gains into limbo. Funding for key offices at the Department of Energy and Department of Transportation have been delayed. The House of Representatives’ proposal to rescind billions in clean energy tax credits and claw back unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds has further chilled investor confidence.

Developers are pausing contracts, and clean energy projects, which help improve the resilience and efficiency of our energy system, are in limbo. According to E2, a nonpartisan group representing business leaders, more than 13,000 clean energy jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2025, largely because of delays and uncertainty. Billions in investment have been held back as projects have stalled. The result? Momentum is lost — possibly for a long time.

The new budget reconciliation deal before the Senate makes these infrastructure bottlenecks worse. It strips away hard-fought gains made under the Biden administration’s agenda — delaying transmission reform, gutting support for fast electricity deployment and muddying the waters for public-private investment. The signal to industry is clear: America can’t make up its mind.

All this is happening while our rivals are building fast. China will spend $138 billion on A.I., robotics and smart infrastructure as part of its “Made in China 2025” plan. Europe is modernizing its ports, roads and digital networks to stay competitive.

Upgrading the infrastructure that underpins American competitiveness should start with the grid. A national transmission strategy must be a cornerstone of economic policy to integrate clean energy generation, large-scale batteries and flexibility. Without it, we can’t move power where it’s needed when it’s needed, and our most promising technologies will die.

We also must ensure that American innovation stays on American soil. Federal investment should focus on scaling technologies invented here, such as advanced nuclear reactors, clean ammonia production, critical minerals processing and next-generation battery chemistry. They are the industrial building blocks of a clean, resilient future, and without strategic government backing, they will be built elsewhere.

Finally, the permitting process, which requires the coordination of federal, state and local agencies, needs to reflect the urgency of the moment. Projects that cut emissions, lower costs and build resilience shouldn’t be forced to wait a decade for approval. Streamlined, sensible permitting reform is essential to unlocking private capital and accelerating deployment.

The infrastructure investments of the past four years represent the most significant progress since the Eisenhower era. But they are neither guaranteed nor permanent. If Congress and the Trump administration don’t act now, we won’t just cede economic advantage. We’ll see energy costs spike, more frequent power outages and investors pushing their companies to scale up in Asia. America will be left with 20th-century tools in a 21st-century world and will once again be left buying back its own inventions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/16/opinion/16shah-pannu/16shah-pannu-facebookJumbo-v2.png,N,,2025-06-16 06:01:17.564397

The Solar Energy Industries Association, a nonprofit advocacy trade group for the solar industry, reports that will have devastating impacts on solar manufacturing, especially in Ohio.

“Ohio has become the number one manufacturing state for solar and other solar products,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

As of right now, the federal government offers a tax credit to boost solar manufacturing. That’s on the chopping block in the house bill, which seeks to stop some $522 billion in investments from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. There’s been some pushback from senators, as they hash out their version of the reconciliation bill, but it remains to be seen how energy credits will fair.

If left unchanged, Hopper said the clean energy tax credit rollbacks will lead to fewer solar projects happening, and therefore fewer people purchasing solar products manufactured in Ohio and other states.

SEIA ranks Ohio 12th in the nation for solar capacity, with the ability to power more than 700,000 homes. The state is home to many companies that make solar parts, however, including inverters, trackers and solar cells. SEIA reports that the industry employs about 8,000 Ohioans.

“Our analysis shows that if the reconciliation bill that passed out of the House isn't changed by the Senate, about 5,600 jobs are at risk in Ohio, and at least 21 factories are at risk of closing their doors,” Hopper told WOSU.

Eric Goodwin is vice president of business development for OMCO Solar, based in the Cleveland suburb of Wickliffe. The 70-year-old OMCO, or Ohio Molding Company, began by making automotive parts and then custom steel parts. The company branched into the solar space in 2007.

“And as of last year – I think this is significant for us – solar was our biggest market for the first time,” Goodwin said.

At its Wickliffe plant, OMCO Solar makes the steel racking that holds solar panels. Goodwin says that’s about 70% of that plant’s business – up from around 30% of business about four years ago.

OMCO Solar also makes single-axis trackers, devices that allow solar panels to follow the sun throughout the day, at factories in Huntsville, Ala and Phoenix.

Goodwin said OMCO already had to navigate a 30% spike in U.S. steel prices that coincided with Trump’s inauguration. Now, OMCO’s customers could lose the flexibility that came with clean energy tax credits, which may lead them to delay or cancel projects.

“I think the biggest impact when we look at this legislation is the ability of our customers to do projects,” Goodwin said.

It’s too early to say what that will ultimately mean for the company or its Ohio employees, Goodwin said.

“We definitely would have to adjust, but we usually try to stay pretty lean, but you know, it could have an impact,” he said.

Nationwide, the solar plants that would suffer exist largely in red states that supported Trump, Goodwin said.

“So many people who voted for Trump are the ones making solar panels. They're making racking. They're out in the field building solar plants,” Goodwin said. “If this stuff goes, it literally turns its back on many people that voted for our current president and administration.”

RELATED: Will renewables help Ohio produce more electricity as generation gap grows?

While the House reconciliation bill guts clean energy tax credits, it supports increased mining and drilling.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson, who represents Licking County and Zanesville, chairs the House Energy Action Team, or HEAT. He’s consistently noted a need for increased energy production.

Balderson didn’t respond to a request for an interview with WOSU.

Balderson and other elected officials who support ramping up gas and coal energy production have said that because of clean energy tax credits, ""green"" projects jammed up the proposed energy project queue. They claim that putting traditional energy production on the backburner threatens the stability of America’s power grid.

Balderson argues that gas and coal are always reliable, while wind and solar are “weather dependent.”

“From banning permits for LNG export terminals to imposing unworkable emission standards or our most critical power plants, the last administration prioritized our politics over practicality and put our energy security at risk,” Balderson said in March while praising Trump’s America First policy. “Our nation has the resources to power our future and supply the world with affordable, reliable energy.”

RELATED: Grid operator in Ohio warns of electricity crunch as data centers boost demand

Balderson also positions Ohio as a leader in natural gas production.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration lists Ohio among the nation’s top 10 natural gas producers. The state produces more gas than it consumes.

Meanwhile, solar made up just 3.17% of Ohio’s energy generation in 2024, but that’s more than double than the previous year, when solar was 1.35% of the state’s energy output. Data shows solar power has grown every year since 2010.

While Balderson has said clean energy policies drive up costs for Americans, SEIA’s Hopper said the reconciliation bill will increase Americans’ electricity bills by around $51 billion over 10 years. She said that amounts to about $100 a year for Ohio families.

“That's because solar and storage are the least priced source of electricity,” Hopper said. “If we take away those tax credits, the prices are going to go up and that's going to affect all of us.”

Hopper also points out that America’s electric grid has to contend with changing technology. Data centers, like the many sprinkled across central Ohio, use enormous amounts of power. America is also in an artificial intelligence race against China.

“So, you can imagine at a time when we are trying to win the AI race, when we are needing every electron that we can get to win, solar and storage is a huge part of that success story,” Hopper said. ""You do not want jobs leaving the state. You don't want factories leaving the state. And you certainly don't wanna hand AI dominance to China.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ecfd914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2016+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce%2Fb3%2F28c0a0904cf9897b406ccb896583%2Famazon-solar-farm-oh-yellowbud-2.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 06:00:27.590935

As the growing share of renewable energy in deep red states showed, even anti-climate Republicans couldn’t forswear cheap renewable energy. Business was willing to ditch Trumpian rhetoric about the dangers of windmills for bottom-line logic: The economics of renewables—solar is the cheapest energy source in human history—spoke for itself. But Trump’s war on renewable energy since returning to office demonstrates the triumph of MAGA dogma over free-market principles. As the irrationality of the “Liberation Day” tariffs reveals, Trump won’t let what’s good for business get in his way this time.

Anything-but-renewables

The Trump administration has launched a full-throated war on renewable energy. From killing the residential solar industry to freezing billions earmarked for clean energy projects in low-income communities to crippling the Department of Energy’s ability to connect renewables to the grid, Trump 2.0 does not compromise.

This isn’t “all of the above,” it’s anything but renewables. Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency, under the National Emergencies Act, explicitly defines ‘energy’ to exclude wind and solar. The Interior Department is fast-tracking permitting for all energy projects except wind and solar. The Republican-controlled Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows natural gas plants to leapfrog clean energy projects stuck in the permitting queue.

House Republicans recently passed a budget that would effectively kill the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) with its myriad clean-energy programs and incentives. They’re not just gutting the technology-neutral production and investment tax credits that formed the core of the IRA—credits that helped create over 330,000 jobs and catalyzed nearly half a trillion in private investment—Republicans are also axing grid modernization loans, energy efficiency programs, and electric vehicle (EV) rebates. If successful, repealing the IRA would decimate America’s nascent manufacturing renaissance, solidify China’s global green-tech dominance, and raise utility bills for American families.

As electricity demand rises, Republicans insist that only “reliable” energy—fossil fuel-powered plants that run 24/7 instead of “intermittent” renewable sources—can keep the lights on and the utility bills low. But solar, wind, and battery storage can and do meet demand affordably and reliably. It also ignores that Republican budget cuts will hamstring even non-intermittent clean energy technologies like nuclear and geothermal, the same tech Republicans have publicly endorsed. Unfortunately for Americans, this war on renewable energy comes with a higher cost.

Trump’s ‘clean coal’ policies purport to reinvigorate America’s coal industry but will only prolong the life of aging coal plants—99 percent of which are more costly to keep running than to replace with wind and solar. Trump recently issued executive orders promoting nuclear power. But many of the administration’s policies make building nuclear power more difficult, including cutting the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s budgets and limiting the latter’s traditional independence. Indeed, the budget that cleared the House last month requalified nuclear projects for tax credits but moved the start date to 2028, a timeline many nuclear projects cannot meet. Even natural gas, the only fossil fuel price competitive with renewable energy, can’t make up the slack. More investment in gas-fired power plants is unlikely to lower energy prices in the near term: Gas projects will take until at least 2030 to come online, and a massive backlog for new gas turbines stretches beyond 2029.

Of course, affordability was never really the point. The point is the MAGA worldview, where the wind never blows and the oil always flows.

MAGA Has Taken the Oil Pill

If Trump’s gutting of cutting-edge scientific research and persecuting corporations perceived as ideologically suspect didn’t alarm Washington, Trump’s on-and-off tariff policy seems to have broken through as ill-planned and doomed to fail.

Naïve as it was to claim to ‘reshore’ American manufacturing without an industrial policy (while gutting its predecessor’s), the administration has yet to lift tariffs on coffee, mangoes, and bananas—tropical crops that cannot be grown in the U.S. (Hawaii and Puerto Rico produce less than 1 percent of U.S. coffee demand.) Trump insists that tariff revenues are enough to obviate income taxes, and he simultaneously celebrates that tariffs will make imports unnecessary altogether. Both can’t be true.

Those with the most financial, ideological, and personal influence can, maybe, capture the president’s ear. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s 90-day tariff delay announced earlier this spring only happened because his Treasury and Commerce Secretaries ambushed the president while Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade advisor and the administration’s most prominent booster of massive tariffs on every nation, had stepped out. They didn’t leave until Trump made the pause official on Truth Social.

The health of American industry now hinges on one’s informal and personal ties to the president, which doesn’t bode well for clean energy, especially since the president’s falling out with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The GOP is still, and has always been, the party of Big Oil. Trump’s tariffs may still harm long-term profits, but, notably, oil interests were one of the rare exceptions in Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. Unfortunately, the logic behind Trump’s Fossil Fuels First strategy is the same as his tariff policy: there is none.

Fossil fuels are such a fundamental part of conservative identity that realism no longer applies.

As Energy Secretary Chris Wright put it: Climate change is “a side effect of building the modern world.” Trump recently posted a clip from the television show Landman, in which Billy Bob Thornton’s oilman character claims that pumping crude is too fundamental to the American way of life to stop: “We don’t do it ’cause we like it. We do it ’cause we run out of options.” But that’s precisely the lie. Trump and his movement drill because they like the war on renewable energy. despite having better options.

The MAGA agenda is irrational. Trump wants energy abundance but kneecaps the fastest-growing energy sector; he wants economic prosperity but imposes the greatest regressive tax in U.S. history. It’s a reflection of the modern conservative movement that has succumbed to far-right conspiracism, becoming so divorced from reality that not even a self-inflicted recession might check it.

Sabotage and Strategy

That’s precisely where Democrats can play their hand. There is an energy crisis: natural gas price volatility, climate-induced extreme weather, and the high cost of aging coal plants have created a perfect storm of rising energy prices. And Trump, Republicans, and their big oil donors are willfully exacerbating it by kneecapping clean energy. Democrats need a unified message that defends climate action as the response to the right’s economic sabotage.

While cheap solar and wind energy projects languish on the sidelines, Republicans are forcing Americans to pay more for dirty fuel. Keep it simple: Fossil fuels = higher prices; clean energy = lower prices.

But Democrats also need to counter the Republican agenda with a bold vision of the nation’s energy future, one of abundant clean supplies and good-paying union jobs.

If Democrats fail to act, they won’t just lose a net-zero-carbon future—they’ll lose the country to a movement that values ideology over prosperity and fantasy over fact.",https://i0.wp.com/washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25143666030115-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-16 06:00:37.931481

Over the past two decades, more than 5 million U.S. households from California to Georgia to Maine have put solar panels on their roofs, drawing energy from the sun and reducing their electric bills.

But that could soon come to a crashing halt.

The big domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans last month would, by the end of this year, eliminate tax credits for homeowners and solar leasing companies that have fueled the popularity of rooftop solar. If it becomes law, it would lead to an immediate plunge in installations, analysts and companies say.

“This sets us back,” said Ben Airth, policy director for Freedom Forever, one of the country’s largest residential solar installers. “I’ve been in this industry 22 years and remember when it was only rich people, doomsday preppers and environmentalists installing solar panels on their roofs.”

One analysis by Ohm Analytics, an energy data firm, estimates that residential solar installations could fall by half next year if the House bill becomes law. Without the tax credits, it would take 17 years, on average, for homeowners to earn back their solar investments. A more pessimistic analysis by Morgan Stanley projects that rooftop solar demand could fall by 85% through 2030.

While Republicans want to curb tax breaks for other renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and large-scale solar farms, the consequences for rooftop solar could be more severe. Rooftop solar can cost two to three times as much per unit of electricity as large solar arrays on farms or in deserts, and the residential industry is more vulnerable to shifts in subsidies.

The Senate is now writing its version of the domestic policy bill, and solar executives have descended on Washington to plead for a more gradual wind-down of the energy credits. They note that the solar industry employs roughly 300,000 workers and that rooftop systems can help homeowners cut their electric bills.

Yet some conservative Republicans have made clear they oppose any restoration of tax breaks for renewable energy.

“Those God forsaken subsidies are killing our energy, killing our grid, making us weaker, destroying our landscape, undermining our freedom,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said on the House floor last week. “I’m not going to have it.”

The uncertainty is upending an industry that was already struggling with tariffs and high interest rates. Last week, Solar Mosaic, which provided loans to homeowners to install rooftop panels, declared bankruptcy. On Monday, Sunnova Energy, one of the nation’s largest rooftop solar companies, followed suit.

Some experts say rooftop solar will eventually rebound, even without subsidies, if electricity prices keep rising around the country, which would make the economics of going solar more favorable. But the adjustment period is likely to be painful, with more bankruptcies and layoffs.

“We’re not expecting residential solar to go away,” said Zoë Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at Wood MacKenzie, an energy research firm. “But it will be smaller.”

Major tax changes

For two decades, Congress has offered tax breaks for people who put solar panels on their roofs. But Democrats supersized those subsidies in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into technologies meant to fight climate change.

The law extended the residential solar credit, which allows homeowners to recoup 30% of the cost of a solar system they own, through 2032. It also expanded an investment tax credit for companies that build low-emissions sources of electricity like solar and batteries.

The latter change fueled a boom in solar leasing, in which homeowners don’t have to pay the upfront cost of a rooftop solar system that can run $30,000 or more. Instead, a company owns the panels and keeps the tax credits. The homeowner leases the equipment from the company and ideally saves money through lower energy bills.

More than 50% of home solar systems are now financed this way, and the rise of leasing has made rooftop solar more accessible to less-wealthy households, as well as to schools, hospitals and small businesses.

The House Republican bill would terminate the residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025. And, in a last-minute change pushed by fiscal conservatives, solar leasing companies would be immediately ineligible for the investment tax credit.

The House bill would also forbid companies from claiming the tax credits if they use components from China, which dominates solar supply chains. Because that provision is so broadly written, many companies say it would effectively make the credits unusable.

“Catastrophic is a fair way to describe the industry impact” of the House bill, said Gregg Felton, CEO of Altus Power, which develops solar projects on rooftops and parking lots.

If Congress slashed support for renewable energy, experts said companies would continue investing in large-scale solar arrays, since even without subsidies those plants are often one of the cheapest ways to generate additional electrons. Rooftop solar, which is costlier and requires more labor, faces greater risks.

Kenny Pfannenstiel, the chief operating officer at Big Dog Solar, an Idaho-based solar installation company, said that rooftop solar has lately grown popular in newer markets like Montana and Idaho.

“We see a lot of interest from people who want to control their own energy future, or who worry about the grid being available when they need it,” Pfannenstiel said. Once the tax credits were expanded, he said, “the economic argument for those customers to install solar and battery systems became a lot stronger.”

If the credits vanished, some customers might still want panels, he said, but the market “would shrink drastically.”

A debate over rooftop solar

The fight over tax credits in Congress isn’t the only challenge facing rooftop solar. While the technology remains popular with homeowners, some states have started pulling back support amid a barrage of criticism.

Electric utilities and some analysts say that rooftop solar users raise costs for everyone else, because solar households pay less on their monthly utility bills but still rely on the broader grid for backup power. That shifts the cost of maintaining the grid to other households, which are often low-income. (Solar proponents disagree, saying that utilities ignore many benefits of rooftop panels, such as avoided transmission costs.)

The fight has been especially fierce in California, the country’s biggest rooftop solar market. In 2022, regulators slashed the compensation that new solar households could receive for the electricity they produce. In the months that followed, rooftop installations fell 85% statewide, straining installers, manufacturers and distributors.

Even now, some officials are looking to cut support further, including for existing homes. “We have to reevaluate how our current solar subsidy programs impact Californians who may not be able to afford solar-panel systems,” said Lisa Calderon, a Democratic state lawmaker.

The rise in interest rates has further squeezed the rooftop solar industry, by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance new installations. The Trump and Biden administrations also increased tariffs on solar components from China, which aids domestic manufacturers but makes panels more expensive.

“At some point our industry can and should be able to function without tax credits,” said Chris Hopper, co-founder of Aurora Solar, a software company that designs home solar systems. “I do think we could get on board with a phase-down of these credits over an appropriate time period that gives us time to figure out how to find efficiencies and lower costs.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d318a6_012cc28c01244094acdf5f9b7ba7a09b~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_841,h_552,al_c,lg_1,q_85/d318a6_012cc28c01244094acdf5f9b7ba7a09b~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-06-16 06:00:42.021763

Technical colleges like Mitchell Tech and Lake Area Tech are partnering with employers and offering specialized training programs to meet workforce demands.

Graduates of these programs are seeing high placement rates and competitive starting salaries.

MITCHELL, S.D. — Matthew Pearson found a successful career in the wind energy industry purely by chance.

After graduating from high school in Vermillion, Pearson knew he didn’t want to pursue a four-year degree and instead scrolled through the list of majors offered at Mitchell Tech, one of the state’s four technical colleges.

“When I came to the wind energy program, I thought, ‘Well, that sounds kind of cool,” Pearson, 28, recalled during a recent interview at Mitchell Tech, the only South Dakota college with a designated wind energy major.

He didn’t know it at the time, but Pearson had stumbled into one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying trade fields in the state and nation.

While workforce shortages plague many industries and employers in the Rushmore State, great opportunities abound for skilled workers to build, operate and maintain renewable energy facilities, including at wind farms. Meanwhile, strong partnerships between technical colleges, employers and the Build Dakota Scholarship program have forged a ready pathway to quickly and effectively fill the need for energy workers.

Pearson obtained a Build Dakota Scholarship that paid all tuition for a two-year wind technology degree, then spent about $15,000 to complete another two-year major in electrical construction.

After graduation, he quickly landed a job wiring wind towers at locations around the country. He was initially paid about $80,000 a year, and after six years was making $127,000 plus a daily living fee of $140.

But now, with a fiancee and two children, Pearson is completing a circle by leaving field work and returning to Mitchell Tech to become its only wind energy program instructor.

“There's been a steady uptick in the need for workforce,” he said. “When I would get to a jobsite, there would be three or four companies there, and they’d always come over and ask, ‘Hey, you want to come work for us instead?’”

About 77% of the power used in the state comes from non-fossil fuel sources, largely from water and wind, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state has three solar farms but no plans filed for more.

Over roughly the past 15 years, the state has seen a tenfold increase in wind energy production, according to the state Public Utilities Commission.

In 2009, the state had 190 turbines capable of producing about 350 megawatts (MW) of electricity. At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy. The PUC also approved a 68-turbine project with a capacity of 260 MW and a $621 million price tag near Clear Lake in March.

“We’ve had just a tremendous expansion of wind energy in South Dakota,” said Chris Nelson, a PUC commissioner. “Today, though, we’re in a little bit of a lull.”

The expected slowdown is due to a lack of transmission lines capable of carrying more power, most of which heads east out of the state, Nelson said.

Two nonprofit energy consortiums that manage the power grid in the upper Midwest plan to spend a combined $37 billion to expand transmission capacity, including in South Dakota, over roughly the next decade.

At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, students are offered two energy-related degree tracks, said president Tiffany Sanderson.

The energy technology major provides training in development and maintenance of energy systems, and the energy operations degree is aimed at managing an energy facility.

The two programs have about two dozen students combined, Sanderson said. In the 2023 graduating class, 100% of all graduates were employed within six months, with average salaries of $65,000 a year in the technology major and $69,000 a year in operations.

“That is for their first jobs in the industry, so those are tremendous opportunities for a brand new graduate with two years of college education,” she said.

In May, Nathaniel Bekaert will become one of those new graduates from Lake Area tech.

Bekaert, 28, grew up on a farm and came to the college after six years in the U.S. Army, which paid for almost all of his tuition, fees and equipment costs.

“The more you learn, the more you want to dive into it,” he said.

With his anticipated degree and work experience, Bekaert said he was recruited extensively by energy companies.

“The amount of energy companies coming in looking for workers is crazy, and you can’t really grasp how many companies are looking for energy students,” he said.

As a native of the Watertown area, Bekaert has accepted a job close to home as a wind technician at the Crowned Ridge wind farm northeast of the city, where he will make $29 an hour plus a $5,000 signing bonus and a $200 annual stipend for work boots.

The South Dakota technical school system, which also includes campuses in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, has developed a close working relationship with the energy industry.

Lake Area Tech officials go into local public schools to promote energy and other trade jobs starting in elementary grades, Sanderson said.

At Mitchell Tech, vice president for enrollment services Clayton Deuter said the college now offers a one-year wind energy degree instead of a two-year program.

Mitchell Tech also offers a dual-enrollment program to high school students so they can have a wind energy degree from the college in hand by the time they graduate.

“You think about return on investment, and here you can take one year in the wind turbine program and you can graduate and make $80,000 to $100,000 a year,” Deuter said.

One of the state’s biggest renewable energy employers is Marmen Energy in Brandon. The Canadian-owned company has 285 employees who build wind towers up to 300-feet tall that are shipped to wind farms nationwide.

Aimee Miritello, human resources manager, said the company’s relationships with high schools and technical colleges form a pillar of the company’s worker recruitment strategy.

“Historically for us that has been one of our best ways of getting qualified employees,” she said.

Marmen has expanded its South Dakota plant to accommodate what Miritello said has been a steady increase in demand for wind towers across the country.

Marmen workers make a good wage, are offered one of the best benefit packages in the region and have strong opportunities for internal advancement, she said.

“Plus, they’re a part of making huge wind towers, so their pride in that is pretty big,” she said.","https://www.thepublicopinion.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PSTC/84007289007-2025410-lake-area-tech-sanderson.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-16 05:01:57.443104

Solar and battery companies, clean energy groups, and consumer advocates just months ago had high hopes for the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which would have created a bonanza of state incentives for energy storage and other grid investments, building on the success of 2017 and 2021 laws that have made the state a clean energy leader.

The legislation failed to pass as the legislature wrapped up at the end of May.

“There were some pretty significant wrenches” thrown in the works in the final days of negotiations, said Hannah Flath, spokesperson for the Illinois Environmental Council, an advocacy group. ​“Some things we just couldn’t untangle.”

The bill would have made Illinois one of a number of states offering subsidies for battery storage on the grid, with the goal of spurring 6 gigawatts of storage by 2030. Solar industry leaders enthusiastically backed the bill, seeing it as a way to build on the solar boom sparked by the two previous state laws, by facilitating solar-plus-storage projects.

Solar and batteries may also be the nation’s best bet to quickly meet growing electricity demand, as equipment backlogs slow down plans to build gas-fueled power plants. ​“The only resource that we believe can [be deployed] in a time frame of a few years is energy storage,” said Andrew Linhares, the Solar Energy Industries Association senior manager for the Central U.S. ​“And of course, pairing it with solar is by far the cheapest new generation you can bring online.”

What would more batteries mean for customers’ wallets?

Cost concerns appeared to be the main reason that some powerful groups opposed the bill and that legislators didn’t embrace it. Utility customers would have picked up the tab for incentives paid to storage developers, which spooked some large industrial consumers and the labor unions representing their workers, according to people involved in the bill negotiations.

Groups that filed witness slips to the legislature in opposition of the bill include the American Petroleum Institute-Illinois, a labor union representing electrical workers in Southern Illinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, a chemical industry group, and an Illinois manufacturers’ trade group.

But investing in battery storage should actually lower energy bills, according to bill proponents, since it could be cheaper for utilities to develop storage than to supplement their power supply with pricey energy from regional markets.

Now proponents wonder whether expected energy-price spikes this summer could ironically persuade lawmakers to revisit the storage plan. Prices are expected to rise in coming months because the grid operators that cover Illinois recently reported high capacity costs to ensure that the grid has enough power-generating capacity if demand suddenly spikes. In the Chicago area, that’s expected to raise customers’ power bills by an average of over $10 a month.

An analysis by the Illinois Power Agency, which procures power on behalf of ComEd and Ameren, found that customers would pay less for electricity under the legislation. By 2035, the average Ameren residential customer could see bills drop by up to $20 a month, and the average ComEd residential customer could see monthly bills drop by up to $8.50.

“All the cost estimates were how much this [bill] would help lower costs. That is the big tragedy here,” said MeLena Hessel, Midwest deputy program director for the national clean-energy advocacy organization Vote Solar. ​“This bill would have saved people money. It would have immediately enabled us to deploy renewables and storage and energy efficiency too, which are the fastest, cheapest ways to address the rising capacity costs.”

Legislators aren’t scheduled to meet again until a short veto session in the late fall, but Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, could reconvene the legislature sooner. The 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which created expansive solar incentives and equity provisions, was passed in such a summer special session.

“The consensus language around energy storage and solar is a response to this crisis, and we have broad buy-in from lawmakers. We’re pretty confident at the end of the day this will happen,” said Linhares. ​“We just need everybody to be pulling in the same direction. We’re eagerly awaiting an announcement about when this might be taken up, whether in the veto session or special session, and we’ll be ready when that announcement comes.”

The hurdles facing Illinois’ most recent clean energy bill

Illinois’s two previous big energy laws — the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021 and the Future Energy Jobs Act in 2017 — were passed after clean-energy developers and advocates squared off with fossil-fuel companies and utilities. In both cases, incentives for nuclear energy provided the political push over the finish line.

This time around, there is no incentive for nuclear on the table; nor is the industry seeking one since increased electricity demand — including from data centers — has boosted the fortunes of the state’s once-financially-ailing nuclear plants.

The bill did call for lifting a moratorium on new nuclear development, but that was considered largely symbolic since a 2023 law allowed development of small modular nuclear reactors.

Labor unions and workers groups helped push for the state’s 2021 climate law, but this time around, some unions opposed the bill. People involved in legislation negotiations said it seemed the unions had allied with oil refineries and utilities that were concerned about cost increases to fund battery storage.

“There were an incredible amount of stakeholders,” said Kady McFadden, legislative strategist for the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition. ​“Advocates, consumer groups, environmentalists, utilities, generators, clean-energy companies, dirty-energy companies, data centers, towns, cooperatives. It’s a lot of work to run a process that involves them all and gets them all where you need them to be politically to pass a package.”

“This is the first energy bill of its size that didn’t have a big trade-off,” meaning incentives for nuclear, McFadden continued. ​“The recipe was a little different here. This is a really big jobs bill, but organized labor was neutral. The utilities would be getting a ton from the energy-efficiency programs, but they were neutral.”

Julie Russell, the chief county assessment officer in central Illinois’ Fulton County, said the bill would help county governments by creating uniform tax-assessment standards for battery storage projects.

“It removes the guesswork from how to value really complex projects such as this, plus it helps remove these from going to the property tax appeal board or getting caught up in court for several years being in limbo, with all the taxing districts involved,” Russell said.

Russell is also the county’s zoning supervisor (“fortunately or unfortunately for me” as she put it), and said a provision capping permit fees at $75,000 for energy projects could be problematic, since it ​“might not cover all the fees associated with making sure we are doing our due diligence” on sprawling proposals. ​“It would have had the potential to be a financial strain on counties.”

Virtual power plants and BYONCE

Along with installing large-scale batteries on the grid, the legislation would have created a ​“virtual power plant” program, allowing the networking of batteries scattered across homes and businesses that could be called on to provide power to the grid in times of high demand. The bill would have also created incentives to help low-income people get batteries in combination with solar arrays, potentially allowing them to earn revenue from a virtual power plant program.

McFadden said ​“the secret coolest part of the bill” was the mandate for state regulators to develop an energy generation and transmission inventory plan similar to the type of ​“integrated resource plan” that utilities are required to carry out in many other states. This planning process would alleviate the need for arduous legislative efforts, advocates said.

“It would be a transformation in how we would do energy planning and modeling in the state,” McFadden said. ​“It’s so significant because passing a giant energy omnibus bill every four to five years is a very poor way to do energy planning and modeling.”

An integrated resource plan would also be mandated for the many rural cooperatives and municipal utilities in Illinois. That would ​“increase transparency for people receiving power from these utilities, really putting the people power back into public power,” Vote Solar Illinois campaign manager Kavi Chintam said.

The setback in negotiations could allow proponents of the bill to build more support for provisions that had been stripped out during the session, namely one nicknamed BYONCE, pronounced like the singer but standing for ​“Bring your own new clean energy.”

That would mandate that power-hungry data centers fund their own new generation capacity, protecting other utility customers from subsidizing the mushrooming demand that data centers are expected to create in the Chicago area.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2160997048.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=b56510289b237f0ca77defb0ba6534bc,N,,2025-06-16 05:02:11.547685

This announcement comes as a concrete response to the increased focus on adding new nuclear generation to U.S. energy resources.

As part of our ongoing series of articles regarding nuclear energy developments, the following provides a brief overview of the TVA application and recent federal and state law surrounding nuclear energy.

1. TVA Application

The TVA views its application as having broader implications beyond receipt of this individual permit. According to Don Moul, TVA President and CEO, ""[t]his is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy...creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology.""

The NRC previously approved an early site permit for the construction of SMRs at the Clinch River site in 2019, which included a certification that the site was usable for the construction of a nuclear plant from a safety, environmental and emergency planning perspective, but without identifying a specific technology. With this CPA, the TVA seeks specific approval for the construction of a GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactor at the Clinch River site. The TVA has a targeted goal of generating nuclear energy by the 2030s. While this is the first application for approval of the BWRX-300 reactor in the U.S., GE Vernova recently announced that the BWRX-300 reactor has been approved for construction in Ontario.

Although it would not be generating energy for public consumption, chemical firm Dow, in partnership with engineering firm X-Energy, has also announced submission of a CPA to the NRC in Spring 2025, which has been accepted for review. According to the Office of Nuclear Energy's announcement of the acceptance, the SMR would be used to power the Dow manufacturing facility in Seadrift, Texas as part of a demonstration project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (""DOE"").

The TVA is similarly seeking strong financial support for its projects through the DOE's Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program with a coalition of over a dozen other energy industry partners. This coalition is applying for the $800 million grant available through the DOE program.

2. Federal Developments

At the federal level, support for and removal of barriers to new nuclear generation has been a focal point of recent legislation and executive orders. The below provides a brief overview of key developments, which will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, including assessments of industry implications.

Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (""NEIMA""): Signed by President Trump in 2019, the NEIMA was intended to promote advances in nuclear power plant designs, signaling an early focus on nuclear generation. The NEIMA required the NRC to establish a staged licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors and to create a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing of commercial advanced reactors. The NRC was also given two years to develop and implement strategies within the existing regulatory framework for licensing research and test reactors. In connection with each of the above, the NRC was further required to provide intermittent progress reports.

Advance Act: Signed by President Biden in 2024, the Advance Act focuses on incentivizing competition through DOE-awarded prizes (including the grant under the Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program that the TVA coalition is applying for) and reducing licensing application fees, promoting microreactors through new NRC guidance and reducing cost for pre-application activities, encouraging placement of nuclear plants at retired coal plant sites, and focusing on U.S. production of high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Executive Orders: The second Trump Administration has continued to emphasize nuclear generation through ongoing executive orders. On May 23, 2025, the Trump Administration issued four executive orders, targeting different elements of the U.S. energy sector. Our recent article discusses the implications of these executive orders.

3. State Developments

At the state level, lawmakers are using a variety of approaches to allow for and incentivize nuclear generation.

Indiana's Senate Enrolled Act No. 424 establishes a cost recover and filing structure for SMRs. Through Colorado's HB25-1040, nuclear power is added to the State's definition of ""clean energy resources"", which would allow nuclear projects to contribute to the State's clean energy goals and receive local funding. This spring, the governor of Massachusetts recently announced the Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act, which, among other actions, would repeal the State's requirement for new nuclear facilities to be approved by a ballot initiative. The Wisconsin State Senate recently passed SB 125 (currently sitting with the Assembly), which would require the establishment of a nuclear sting study to identify opportunities and sites for nuclear development.

Certain states like Minnesota have outright moratoriums on the construction of new nuclear plants but their lawmakers have begun reassessing those limitations.While they did not pass, two bills were proposed this spring that would either entirely remove Minnesota's moratorium or specifically authorize the construction of SMRs.

4. More to Come

The TVA's application signals renewed industry interest in nuclear energy generation, and combined with legislative and executive pressures, we anticipate many more developments in this area.

The first would repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
The other would repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which also target coal-fired power plants.
“These rules were a direct assault on our coal communities, designed to force a rapid transition away from fossil fuels by imposing unworkable emissions standards on existing power plants,” Morrisey continued.
We need more power, not less, and yet this Clean Power Plan would pull some of our baseload power off the grid.","CHARLESTON — West Virginia officials in Congress and inside the State Capitol Building praised President Donald Trump for an effort to undo rules put in place by former President Joe Biden to regulate coal-fired power plants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it was moving forward with two efforts. The first would repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The other would repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which also target coal-fired power plants.

In a statement Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that leaving these regulations in place would cause the nation’s remaining coal-fired power plants to close, increase electricity costs on customers, and put strain on an electrical grid with increasing demands on it from data centers.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” Zeldin said. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The EPA released new regulations last year that would have required coal-fired power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emission by 90% by 2039, moving up a previous requirement by one year. Plants could also utilize underground carbon capture and sequestration to meet the 90% requirement. The new regulations included stricter limits on mercury emissions, the amount of seepage of coal ash into local waterways, and the amount of wastewater discharge from plants.

According to the EPA’s own estimates, repealing these regulations could save the electricity industry as much as $19 billion in regulatory costs over a two-decade period beginning next year, while repealing the 2024 MATS Amendments could save as much as $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade.

According to the state Public Energy Authority, West Virginia has nine coal-fired power plants accounting for 88.9% of the electricity generated in the state, or a combined net summer capacity of more than 13,000 megawatts.

The EPA’s emission standards date back to 2015 under former President Barack Obama. The Attorney General’s Office — under former attorney general Patrick Morrisey — secured two victories against the EPA before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 and 2022 over the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and in defense of a new Affordable Clean Energy Rule recommended during Trump’s first term.

“Administrator Zeldin’s decision to withdraw the unlawful Greenhouse Gas Rule and the deeply flawed Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a major victory for West Virginia, our energy producers, and every American who depends on reliable, affordable electricity,” said Morrisey, now serving as West Virginia’s 37th governor.

“These rules were a direct assault on our coal communities, designed to force a rapid transition away from fossil fuels by imposing unworkable emissions standards on existing power plants,” Morrisey continued. “This action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.”

U.S. Shelley Moore Capito, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, spoke with reporters Thursday afternoon during her weekly briefing from Capitol Hill. She called the EPA’s move an important step to unleashing energy independence.

“I think the repeal of the Clean Power Plan 2.0 will return us to common sense,” said Capito, R-W.Va. “We are looking at a shortage of power in this country. We need more power, not less, and yet this Clean Power Plan would pull some of our baseload power off the grid. I think it would really put us in a perilous situation.”

On the other side of the U.S. Capitol Building, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore said leaving the Biden-era coal-fired power plant rules in place would have resulted in job losses and potentially additional power plant closures in West Virginia.

“The Biden-Harris war on affordable, reliable American energy ends today,” said Moore, R-W.Va. “By reversing these job-killing regulations, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin make it clear: the Green New Scam is over and American energy dominance is back. These EPA regulations would have shuttered every coal-fired power plant in America, bankrupted many coal mines, laid off thousands of coal miners, and driven up the cost of electricity for every American.”

The move Wednesday by Trump’s EPA was not praised by all. The Sierra Club said Wednesday that repealing these regulations would allow coal-fired power plants to increase their carbon emissions seven times over current levels and increase the number of medical issues linked to increased mercury and other pollutants in the atmosphere.

“It’s completely reprehensible that Donald Trump would seek to roll back these lifesaving standards and do more harm to the American people and our planet just to earn some brownie points with the fossil fuel industry,” said Patrick Drupp, climate policy director for the Sierra Club. “This repeal means more climate disasters, more heart attacks, more asthma attacks, more birth defects, more premature deaths.

“This administration is transparently trading American lives for campaign dollars and the support of fossil fuel companies, and Americans ought to be disgusted and outraged that their government has launched an assault on our health and our future,” Drupp continued. “The Sierra Club will not stand by and let this corrupt administration destroy these critical, lifesaving guardrails.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintermountain.com/images/2025/06/15174925/Power-Plant-06-12-25-588x500.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 05:02:15.075291

The budget reconciliation bill, passed by a single vote in the House, is pending markups and approval in the Senate. The budget package would repeal multiple federal policies, funding programs and tax credits driving American energy manufacturing and deployment.

Daniel O'Brien, senior modeling analyst for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said higher costs would hit the Kansas renewable energy economy hard.

""Kansas is another state that has really high wind penetration,"" O'Brien pointed out. ""Close to 50% of their generation capacity is wind and it's a really cheap resource in Kansas because of the high-capacity factors.""

O'Brien noted the bill could cost Kansas 97,000 jobs and shrink the Kansas economy by more than $1 billion by 2030. He added passing it could also slow or halt the state's recent gains in energy and manufacturing by eliminating billions in tax credits and delaying investments.

O'Brien explained the bill is designed to make room in the budget for billions of dollars in tax cuts for mostly wealthy Americans. The analysis estimates the bill's cuts to health care would increase the average American's energy bill by $200-$300 a year and by $900 in some states.

""These tax incentives were really driving development of manufacturing in the United States,"" O'Brien emphasized. ""We see a loss of 840,000 jobs in the next five years if this bill is passed in the state that it exists in the House.""

O'Brien stressed the bill would also dramatically slow the deployment of new power generation in Kansas at a time of rapidly growing electricity demand, and cut new electricity capacity by 4.8 gigawatts by 2030.

""Increasing the cost of development of wind in Kansas is something that's really going to harm the agricultural industry,"" O'Brien underscored. ""Because they're losing that revenue that they'd otherwise be gaining by selling electricity back to the grid.""

A new analysis of what Congressional lawmakers have dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act found it would eliminate thousands of jobs in South Dakota and slow economic growth.

The bill's current language repeals multiple federal policies, funding programs and tax credits meant to boost American clean energy and manufacturing.

Daniel O'Brien, senior modeling analyst for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said South Dakota could lose as many as 1,600 jobs by 2030 as funding is diverted to jobs in the coal, oil and gas industries.

""Those are but a fraction of the number of jobs that are being lost in manufacturing, construction, utilities, farming and agriculture,"" O'Brien explained.

O'Brien noted up to 840,000 jobs nationwide could be eliminated over the next five years if the current bill remains intact. It repeals more than $500 billion in Inflation Reduction Act investments, which some House Republicans have dubbed a ""green new scam.""

South Dakota households currently benefit from low energy prices, partly due to the growth of renewable energy. The industry has drawn more manufacturing to the state, along with data centers in need of large amounts of cheap power. But the analysis showed a shift toward fossil fuels will increase annual statewide energy bills by more than $180 million by 2035.

O'Brien stressed industries looking to reduce costs may choose to operate elsewhere.

""When you repeal these tax credits, you lose the incentivization of companies to build out cheap renewables in South Dakota,"" O'Brien pointed out. ""For that reason, companies that are relying on their cheap power might go to other states or they might move outside of the U.S.""

He added gas prices are also expected to rise with the repeal of EPA rules on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards. Zero-emission vehicle sales in South Dakota are expected to fall from more than 50% in 2030 to around 30% over the next five years.

As Washington D.C.'s sole gas company continues a multi-billion dollar, 40-year project to replace methane pipes, clean energy advocates argue the projects are misguided and alternatives to gas pipes are better for public health and the environment.

Washington Gas's plan will upgrade 200 miles of gas pipes in the District, costing more than $200 million for the third phase of pipe replacement, paid for by rate hikes on consumers.

In February, a majority of District council members signed a letter urging the Public Service Commission to direct the company to focus only on pipes that need to be fixed.

The company has fallen behind on a similar project in Maryland.

Claire Mills, District of Columbia campaigns manager with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said many pipes being replaced are plastic and less than 25 years old.

She says only lead pipes over 40 years old are likely to leak.

""Even small gas leaks that don't have the potential to explode,"" said Mills, ""are putting methane gas, which is a hugely powerful greenhouse gas, into our atmosphere and creating climate change.""

Washington Gas claims in a brochure that the D.C. project has led to the creation of more than 600 jobs. The company also argues it cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5,000 metric tons.

Since 2018, when the District project began, the number of gas leaks across the District has decreased by nearly 25%, according to the Public Service Commission.

There were more than 1,200 instances of the gas leaks in 2023.

Mills says groups like hers are urging the Public Service Commission to create a plan that transitions the District to clean electricity, rather than doubling down on methane gas.

""Even if your gas pipe is all good, just burning methane gas in your home in your gas stove or your furnace has really negative health impacts,"" said Mills. ""So in the long term, the real solution to this problem is moving the District off of methane gas through a managed transition that takes a serious approach.""

The Public Service Commission is holding a hearing on the project tomorrow at its office in downtown D.C. at 5:30 p.m.

The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to roll back Biden-era limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and natural gas power plants, a move critics said would negatively affect Pennsylvanians' health and the environment.

The agency estimated the proposal would cut regulatory costs for the power sector by $19 billion over 20 years starting in 2026.

Thomas Schuster director of the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club, explained the EPA wants to roll back standards on carbon pollution from power plants, a major source of emissions in Pennsylvania. He warned the move will put Pennsylvanians at risk.

""The rollback of these safeguards will mean that Pennsylvanians will be saddled with more extreme weather, more respiratory illnesses, more hospital visits and missed work,"" Schuster outlined. ""We're basically out of time to deal with the climate crisis, and we can't afford to reset the clock on the clean energy transition.""

Schuster argued the EPA cannot just scrap the standards. To replace them, it must go through the same formal rulemaking process it took to put the standards in place. He urged the public to speak up during the comment period required by the process. The EPA countered repealing regulations on coal and gas power plants will lower energy costs, boost national security and help power U.S. manufacturing and artificial intelligence.

Schuster believes EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin's attempts at deregulation will have major future consequences. He stressed climate change results in more public health problems, premature deaths and catastrophic weather disasters. He contended the agency is ignoring clean energy options while promoting destructive policies.

""They're talking about rolling back toxic pollution standards from these plants as well, which contribute to pollutants like mercury, which are neurotoxins, which can really affect the development of children,"" Schuster noted.

Schuster emphasized climate change is also driving extreme weather in Pennsylvania, pointing to April's storm, which knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people and how last year was Pittsburgh's hottest on record, with cities across the state breaking 20 daily heat records in June. He added heavy rainfall last April triggered major landslides.

As part of the current budget bill going through Congress, the solar incentives might be phased out as early as the end of the year — nine years earlier than originally legislated.
Moreover, phasing out solar incentives creates a domino effect of increased demand for the best installers.

Generating your own clean energy and helping the planet comes with a rewarding feeling, too.","If you've been waiting to go solar, now is probably the time to take the plunge before government incentives potentially go poof.

That being said, even without the 30% residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC), installing solar panels is a ""smart financial move"" according to Emily Walker, director of content and insights at EnergySage, a leading solar company.

In a blog post, President and Chief Operating Officer of EnergySage, Charlie Hadlow, laid out the fragile situation for the ITC. As part of the current budget bill going through Congress, the solar incentives might be phased out as early as the end of the year — nine years earlier than originally legislated.

According to Hadlow, the end of the ITC would result in a loss of $9,000 in savings for the average American who puts up panels. Undoubtedly, the ITC has made solar more financially available to many Americans while creating jobs and fueling the transition to clean energy.

Despite its benefits, ""chances are high,"" in Hadlow's estimation, that the credit will be eliminated before the new year. That creates a lot of urgency because only solar systems that are fully installed and up and running by then will be eligible for the 30% tax credit.

Moreover, phasing out solar incentives creates a domino effect of increased demand for the best installers. Equipment availability could also become a concern as homeowners rush to beat the deadline.

EnergySage's free tools can help homeowners navigate the increasingly tricky market with solar installation estimates and the ability to compare quotes. The average homeowner can land up to $10,000 in incentives for solar purchases and installation with the company's help.

Even without the ITC, there are strong reasons to install solar panels. Going solar is a great way to generate your own clean energy, save money on energy bills, reduce your reliance on the grid, and cut down on planet-heating pollution.

As Walker told The Cool Down, homeowners are ""projected to save up to $100,000 over the lifetime of your solar panel system."" Installation cost is typically paid back in seven to eight years while generating electricity for decades.

Panels can also boost your home's value and protect you from ""unpredictable utility rate hikes,"" Walker pointed out. Generating your own clean energy and helping the planet comes with a rewarding feeling, too.

Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power, subsidiaries of the national utility American Energy Power, are asking West Virginia energy regulators to approve a settlement allowing them to raise rates and make changes to net metering for owners of rooftop solar panels.

A hearing on the case is scheduled for this Tuesday in Charleston.

West Virginia electricity rates have doubled in 15 years, and residents can't shoulder another 13% increase to their monthly bill - explained Courtney MacDonald, coalition coordinator for West Virginians for Energy Freedom.

""In West Virginia, it's important to note that because we live in a monopolized energy system,"" said MacDonald, ""folks don't really have the choice in terms of where they get their energy from, and what that energy is going to cost them.""

According to the company, the rate increase is needed to improve operations and provide reliable power to households. Around 460,000 customers across 25 West Virginia counties rely on AEP for power.

The utility's proposal would also slash the net metering credit for excess energy produced, by two-thirds.

That would mean homeowners with solar panels would receive a lower payment for the electricity they send back to the grid.

MacDonald said folks can speak up on how these changes would impact them at a Tuesday rally in Charleston, and by submitting comments at the public hearing.

""That's really an important opportunity for people to make sure that the Public Service Commission knows that they're not for these changes,"" said MacDonald, ""and really how it's impacting them and their day to day lives. ""

According to a Pew survey released this month, wind and solar power are still popular renewable energy options overall.

However, Americans are less supportive of using them since the first Trump administration, with the sharpest decline among Republicans.

CHARLESTON — A former state senator who previously led West Virginia’s economic development initiatives is urging President Donald Trump and Congress to keep in place energy tax credits, while U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito believes that some of those credits need to be reviewed or repealed.

Mitch Carmichael, a former member of the House of Delegates and state Senate, is the leader of Built for America, a new advocacy organization, urging the Trump administration to not roll back energy tax credits.

Carmichael served as state senate president and lieutenant governor from 2017 to the end of 2020, then served under former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., as the first secretary of the new Department of Economic Development until the fall of 2024.

During his tenure as a cabinet secretary, Carmichael oversaw the recruitment of several major manufacturers to the state, including the Form Energy grid battery project in Weirton, and the Berkshire Hathaway/Timet titanium melt facility near Ravenswood that will be powered by a solar energy microgrid. Carmichael also serves as a senior advisor for strategic initiative for LG Nova.

These projects, along with many others across the nation, are benefiting from energy tax credits within bills signed by former President Joe Biden, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But Carmichael said these tax credits are vital to Trump’s goal to return manufacturing back to the United States.

“I’m proud to lead Built for America as Executive Director because the fight to defend the energy tax credits driving America’s manufacturing comeback is one we can’t afford to lose,” Carmichael said. “Built for America is a new organization working to defend the tax credits that are powering America’s manufacturing comeback, creating jobs, and helping America beat China.”

Following his inauguration for a second non-consecutive term in January, Trump ordered all federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the 2022 IRA or the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in a 215-214-1 vote, sending it to the U.S. Senate.

The bill is a budget and spending reconciliation package which continues the 2017 tax cuts that went into effect during Trump’s first term and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill also includes nearly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts through various methods, including work requirements for Medicaid benefits and the elimination of several tax credits made possible by the IRA.

Specifically, the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would eliminate tax breaks and incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen projects, as well as phase out tax credits for consumers purchasing new electric vehicles among other rollbacks. If enacted as the House intended, the rollbacks could end more than $522 billion in investments made possible through the IRA.

However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work.

“They reward U.S. companies that build here, hire here, and deliver results by putting America first,” Carmichael said. “Unlike mandates…these credits are performance-based and results-driven. They support an all-of-the-above energy approach, empowering innovation in nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and other emerging technologies.”

Carmichael also said repealing the tax breaks would benefit companies competing with the U.S. for energy, such as China. Built for America is launching a $2 million ad campaign aimed at swaying Congress and the White House to reconsider some of the proposed cuts.

“No one has done more to jumpstart American manufacturing than President Trump, and these credits are aligned with his America First mission,” Carmichael said. “They’re helping us beat China, rebuild the middle class, and power a new era of American industrial strength. That’s a fight worth having.

“Repealing these credits would ship jobs and supply chains back to China and hand America’s energy future to our adversaries,” Carmichael continued. “That’s why I’m proud to stand with Built for America and lead this fight.”

Capito, R-W.Va., is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA. Speaking to reporters Thursday during a weekly phone call from Capitol Hill. Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases.

“Everything was tilted towards clean energy, and it was just incredibly lopsided and incredibly generous, so those need to be scaled back no doubt, and some of them absolutely probably need to be stopped immediately,” Capito said. “Others, I think, need a better transition.”

As an example, Capito cited the 45V hydrogen tax credit created by the IRA, which offers incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, with potential payouts up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Capito advocated for regional hydrogen hubs in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including what is now the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub project.

“The House put in their bill that in order for you to take advantage of 45V…you have to be under construction by the end of this year,” Capito said. “Well, you and I both know, and I think those at the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub know, that’s impossible. That knocks us out of the game, and I don’t want to see us knocked out of being a leader on a new and promising type of energy production…So, I’ve asked if we can make provisions there.”

Once other Senate committees release their reconciliation language, the Senate could begin voting on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill reconciliation package by the end of next week. Capito said Congress needs to get the energy incentives right.

“We need to unleash American energy,” Capito said. “The (previous) administration has spent three and a half years trying to cap our American innovation in the energy space and we’re going to open it back up again – one of (Trump’s) main tenants for his presidency…I’m very excited to be able to be a part of that.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/06/16013435/Capito-Carmichael-06-13-25-673x500.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 03:02:28.964889

The global transition to renewable or green energy has led to a surge in demand for lithium, a critical raw material (CRM) in the production of lithium-ion batteries principally used in electric vehicles (EVs) and as storage devices for renewable energy. The four countries in the world with the largest proven reserves of lithium are Chile, Australia, Argentina and China, which, between them, have over 23 million metric tonnes of lithium deposits. Lithium deposits are also found in a number of African countries. Zimbabwe, DR Congo, Mali, Namibia and Ghana are estimated to hold 4.9 million tonnes of lithium reserves, 6 percent of global deposits. Nigeria has recently intensified exploration for lithium deposits and is now the country with the sixth largest lithium reserves in Africa. However, Zimbabwe has the largest lithium ore reserves in Africa. Indeed, two of the largest lithium mines in the world, Bikita and Acacia, are located in Zimbabwe. In 2023, the Acacia mine produced about 500,000 metric tonnes of lithium concentrate.

Most of the remaining part of this article is going to focus on Zimbabwe’s effort in developing its lithium deposits against the background of several limitations and constraints and what the rest of Africa can learn from it. The Zimbabwean economy is recovering after years of economic dislocation and hyperinflation. Inflation was 92.1 percent in May 2025, compared to 500 percent in 2020. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and mining. Zimbabwe came under heavy economic sanctions from Western countries when it introduced land reforms in 2000 that redistributed land away from a few white commercial farmers that owned a disproportionate amount of agricultural land. As a result, it initiated its “Look East Policy”, which drove the country into the warm embrace of China as an alternative source of trade and foreign investment. Chinese mining companies took ample advantage of this to dominate lithium mining in Zimbabwe almost exclusively. The five major lithium mining companies in Zimbabwe are all Chinese. They were all exporting raw lithium ore to feed the insatiable appetite of Chinese lithium battery manufacturers, which are the largest in the world.

However, from December 2022 Zimbabwe introduced a lithium beneficiation policy which made the export of raw lithium ore illegal. Zimbabwean lithium has since then been processed into lithium concentrate before export in order to create jobs and add value to the local mining industry. The lithium beneficiation policy is to be used as a medium- to long-term industrialisation strategy in Zimbabwe, which is linked to the country’s Vision 2030 national development plan, with the aim to achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8-9 percent by 2030.

“Apart from the lithium concentrate processing plants under construction, there is a lithium refinery under construction close to Abuja and another in the Lekki industrial zone in Lagos.”

By January 2027, the next stage of the lithium beneficiation strategy will kick in: exports of lithium concentrate will also be banned. The policy will eventually cut across the various lithium processing value chains to the production of lithium-ion batteries and possibly eventually electric vehicles. Zimbabwe produced and exported 2.4 million tonnes of lithium concentrate in 2024. The plan is to process all that and more into lithium sulphate, which will capture more value for the Zimbabwean economy. Already two lithium sulphate plant projects are under construction by two leading Chinese lithium mining companies – Sinomine and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt at Bikita and Arcadia mines.

“Lithium sulphate is made by refining lithium concentrate and is used to produce high-valued battery-grade chemicals like lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.” Local processing of lithium concentrate into lithium sulphate adds considerable value to the product. For example, battery-grade lithium carbonate sells for about USD 7000 per tonne, compared to USD 570 per tonne for lithium concentrate in the Shanghai Metals Market. The considerable boost to Zimbabwe’s foreign exchange earnings can be better imagined. The process of local value addition is expected to continue at later stages until lithium-ion batteries are locally produced in Zimbabwe.

There are lessons other lithium deposit-laden African countries can learn from Zimbabwe. Currently virtually all of the countries are processing lithium ore into lithium concentrate. Nigeria is making remarkable strides in this regard with a number of lithium ore processing plants, including a lithium refinery billed to be commissioned this year, all of them with heavy Chinese investment commitment. What the Zimbabwean example has shown is that processing lithium ore into lithium concentrate is just a first step to extracting more tangible value from the “white gold. ” A great deal more value can be extracted through further processing or refining. It is gratifying to note that Nigeria has a proactive and robust lithium beneficiation strategy. Apart from the lithium concentrate processing plants under construction, there is a lithium refinery under construction close to Abuja and another in the Lekki industrial zone in Lagos.

Read also: China to establish electric vehicle factories in Nigeria, tapping lithium riches

There is a need for the creation of an African Association of Lithium Producers and Processors as a platform for the countries to compare notes and plan a common strategy to maximise and optimise local value addition. A Pan-African approach with the intervention of the African Union Development Agency-New Partnership for Africa’s Development (AUDA-NEPAD) secretariat and the African Development Bank (AfDB) will be necessary in the spirit of Mission 300/African Energy Summit.

The lesson to learn from China by African countries is that the achievement of the goal of Mission 300 to connect 300 million more Africans to electricity by 2030 should be pursued from a broader perspective of incorporating local value through local manufacturing of both fossil fuel and renewable energy power generation equipment. That includes local manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, and solar power storage batteries through investment in lithium ore beneficiation and refining and eventually the production of lithium-ion batteries for renewable energy storage, which is a key component of renewable or green energy solutions.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lithium-batteries.png,N,,2025-06-16 03:02:23.786678

However, current regulations permit up to 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for renewable energy projects, under the ‘automatic route’.
The SECI Request for Selection (Rfs) also acknowledges this policy framework and has integrated these restrictions in its bid document.
Mandating full disclosure of every beneficial owner could either violate international agreements or force such investors to look elsewhere.
Renuka Sane is managing director at TrustBridge, which works on improving the rule of law for better economic outcomes for India.","Achieving the objectives

Consider the rule that requires bidders to provide complete information about their promoters or the definition of control. The definitions include entities that own the company directly or indirectly, which would entail several layers of entities that may own the company through different shareholding structures. It would have helped matters if SECI had articulated why it feels the need for these conditions, and what risks it is trying to mitigate. The absence of a formal regulatory impact assessment or a detailed explanation leaves stakeholders guessing. If one were to speculate, the rationale may fall into three categories:

Financial viability: SECI may want to be assured that the bidder has the financial wherewithal to see the project to completion, and transparency on beneficial ownership may help it to ensure that related entities are not blacklisted or in default of their financial obligations in other transactions. The restrictions on control may also be seen to help with financial viability and operational performance.

Competition integrity: SECI may want to ensure that a single corporate group does not exceed the maximum bidding capacity by using multiple affiliated companies, and that there is no collusion between entities that might compromise the bidding process.

National security: In an era of geopolitical tension, SECI may be concerned that opaque structures could mask investments from actors deemed hostile or untrustworthy.

While each of these reasons has merits, a fundamental rule of public policy should be to achieve the objectives at the least possible cost.

Entities bidding for such projects either bid themselves or set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). For financial scrutiny, SECI can simply demand proof of a minimum net worth and an undertaking from the bidder that no insolvency proceedings are pending or imminent. These steps focus on project viability without prying into ownership structures. Competition concerns can be resolved through both ex-ante and ex-post measures. Bidders can be mandated to sign a legally binding certificate stating their bid was developed independently and without consultation with any competitor. Reverse auctions, particularly when held in real-time, reduce the effectiveness of cartel behaviour. SECI can also set a confidential reserve price based on its own internal estimates. If the lowest bid is significantly above this price, all bids can be rejected, thwarting an attempt to fix prices at an artificially high level. Ex-post penalties, including disqualification from future bids, can act as strong deterrents against collusive behaviour.

A more nuanced approach

The question of national security is an important one. However, current regulations permit up to 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for renewable energy projects, under the ‘automatic route’. The Government of India, in 2020, placed restrictions on investments from countries that share land border with India in order to curb opportunistic takeovers and acquisitions of Indian companies. The SECI Request for Selection (Rfs) also acknowledges this policy framework and has integrated these restrictions in its bid document. If bidders have cleared these hurdles, then there may be little to be gained from insisting on a disclosure of all the layers of beneficial ownership, and including them in the definition of control.

This brings us to the fundamental nature of renewable energy financing. Projects are typically structured through funds, and consortiums that span multiple jurisdictions. Limited partners (LPs), general partners (GPs), and various institutional investors—including pension funds and sovereign wealth funds–often pool resources through layered, regulated, and audited structures. A global fund may have hundreds of underlying investors, many of whom insist on confidentiality. Mandating full disclosure of every beneficial owner could either violate international agreements or force such investors to look elsewhere.

Restrictions of the kind placed by SECI make it harder for developers to attract the kind of long-term institutional investment that is essential for scaling up. If India is serious about achieving its 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity target by 2030, SECI’s procurement design will need to accommodate the realities of how projects are developed, financed, and transferred. The Ministry of Power and SECI need to take a more nuanced view of transparency. It should not mean unfiltered visibility into every last detail. Rather, it should begin with a clear articulation of objectives—whether financial security, competition, national security or some other objective—and search for the tool that best meets the specific objective.

India’s renewable energy story will be shaped not just by domestic policy but by the willingness of global investors to see the country as a reliable and predictable partner. SECI’s future tenders would do well to reflect this understanding.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released its long-awaited Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) proposal for 2026 and 2027 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). That proposal makes significant increases in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel—from 3.35 billion gallons in 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026, or a 67-percent increase.

Altogether, refiners would be required to blend 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels in both 2026 and 2027.

The announcement also includes a key provision to discount Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit values for foreign fuels and feedstocks, effectively prioritizing soybean oil and ethanol produced in the U.S. Under the proposal, biofuels and feedstocks produced outside the U.S. will receive only 50-percent of the RIN value compared to those produced within the U.S.

National ag and biofuels leaders expressed their approval for EPA’s biofuel proposal.

Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA):

“As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the American Soybean Association applauds the work of President Trump, Administrator Zeldin and Secretary Rollins in promoting American energy dominance and strengthening a key domestic market for U.S. soybean farmers. The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors, and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities. We thank the Trump Administration for recognizing and supporting this vital value chain for U.S. agriculture.”

Kenneth Hartman, Jr., President of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA):

“We are thankful to President Trump and Administrator Zeldin that the EPA has released these robust RVO numbers in a timely manner. This action provides a significant certainty to corn farmers across the country who rely on a stable biofuels industry.”

Zippy Duvall, President of American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF):

“Farm Bureau applauds the Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin for recognizing the importance of biofuels for farmers and America’s families. EPA’s proposed Renewable Fuel Standard for 2026 and 2027 would increase domestic biofuel production, prioritize home-grown crops, and enable producers to meet the demands of emerging international markets. America’s families who choose to use biofuels could see much-needed relief at the gas pump, with savings of 10 to 30 cents per gallon.

“Renewable fuels have been a tremendous success story for the country and our rural economy. The RFS has reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and created markets for farmers who answered the call to help America become energy independent.”

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA):

“Today’s proposal is an important step toward achieving President Trump’s vision of lower gas prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance. The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers, while boosting the supply of lower-cost, American-made energy. We thank Administrator Lee Zeldin and his team at EPA for listening to stakeholders from agriculture and the entire fuels industry as this proposal was being crafted.”

“This proposal sends a very positive and powerful signal to U.S. renewable fuel producers and farmers. It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,” Cooper said. “We look forward to providing more feedback to EPA on the proposed volumes during the public comment period, and we’ll continue to underscore the vital importance of a strong RFS to America’s rural communities.”

“The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA’s plans on SREs, and today’s proposal helps to clarify the agency’s approach moving forward,” Cooper said. “We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump’s first administration. However, EPA’s top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.”

Kurt Kovarik, Vice President of Federal Affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America:

“Today’s RFS proposal is a welcome and timely signal to U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF producers as well as America’s farmers and agricultural businesses. The industry has made major investments in domestic production capacity and feedstocks to meet America’s energy needs and provide consumers affordable, cleaner fuels. We anticipate this will have a tremendous beneficial impact for American farmers and agricultural communities and we look forward to working with President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin to finalize this rule and fully unleash U.S. clean fuel producers.”

“Our industry supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF to the U.S. market in 2024, and is poised to deliver more in 2026. The U.S. biomass-based diesel industry supports 107,400 jobs and generates $42.4 billion in economic activity. Continued market growth and stability through the RFS will enable more economic opportunities, create more jobs, and revitalize America’s agricultural sector.”

“We appreciate Administrator Zeldin’s commitment to find effective solutions to the remaining backlog of small refinery exemptions. We look forward to working with him to ensure that those solutions do not erode the U.S. market for biomass-based diesel and harm American farmers and consumers.”

A four-minute video shows Pennsylvania career and technical educators exploring weatherization and energy-efficient home construction through training by the Next Door Ready to Work Program.","The Clean Energy Center at Penn College has launched a new marketing campaign and workforce readiness program to help Pennsylvania weatherization employers fill their critical need for workers.

The Weatherization Assistance Program is a federal program that helps low-income families reduce their energy costs by making their homes more energy-efficient. The program began in 1976 and is administered at the state level by the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development.

Thirty-three nonprofits and community action agencies and approximately 200 subcontractors perform the work to weatherize Pennsylvania homes that qualify for the program. Typically, they weatherize roughly 1,000 homes annually.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 provided more funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program, allowing agencies to weatherize an additional 13,000 homes over the life of the grant.

With the increase in funding came an increased need for workers. Pennsylvania’s weatherization workforce will need to double to meet this demand. Building on a 40-year partnership centered on quality workforce development initiatives, DCED turned to the Clean Energy Center at Penn College for innovative solutions.

“DCED charged us with leading the effort to develop innovative approaches to recruit individuals into careers in energy efficiency and weatherization,” said Pamela Dincher, executive director for strategic initiatives for Workforce Development at Penn College. “Our approach is twofold. First, we are providing the state with a comprehensive marketing strategy aimed at raising awareness of these careers. Second, we’re helping them build a pipeline of future workers through career readiness and exploration programming.”

The Clean Energy Center, part of Penn College’s Workforce Development department, has worked with a marketing agency to develop the Weather the Future campaign, which began in February. This marketing effort includes a new website and a series of digital, social media, and radio ads running in areas of Pennsylvania that have the most critical need for workers.

These areas include Allegheny, Beaver, Bedford, Bucks, Butler, Cambria, Centre, Chester, Clearfield, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Fulton, Greene, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Mercer, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia, Washington, Westmoreland and York counties.

Among the marketing campaign's promotions, this :30-second video, featuring a real story from a weatherization professional, emphasizes the personal and community-level benefits of pursuing a career in energy efficiency and highlights the growing demand for skilled workers and the pride that comes with making a difference.

The second part of the Clean Energy Center’s initiative is the Next Door Ready to Work program. This program, which started in 2024, is designed to introduce Pennsylvania’s career and technical education students to the weatherization industry. The goal is to match CTE students with weatherization employers to arrange job shadowing, work-based learning, and full-time job opportunities.

CTE instructors are first exposed to the industry and Building Science Principles curriculum by attending a two-day training event. Each participating school also receives training equipment and curriculum to help them take this knowledge back to their classrooms and share with their students. Students at these schools have the opportunity to earn the Building Science Principles certificate, which is an industry-recognized credential. Field trips to the Clean Energy Center’s labs in Williamsport, Harrisburg, Latrobe and Pittsburgh, which include hands-on activities, are yet another component of the program.

Since the Next Door Ready to Work program launched last year, 19 schools in Pennsylvania have participated. More than 90 students have visited Clean Energy Center labs, students from six schools are scheduled to earn certificates before the end of the school year, and one student has already landed a full-time job with benefits before they’ve even graduated.

A four-minute video shows Pennsylvania career and technical educators exploring weatherization and energy-efficient home construction through training by the Next Door Ready to Work Program. In the piece, instructors highlight how these skills can better prepare students for future careers.

I therefore welcome the steps that this Government has taken towards achieving its climate goals since it entered office.

Making Britain a clean energy superpower, delivering clean power by 2030, and accelerating the transition to net zero across the economy are amongst this Government’s key missions. This is why one of the first actions it took following the General Election last summer was to start setting up the first publicly owned energy generation company in 75 years, Great British Energy. This company is owned by the British people and will drive clean energy deployment to create jobs, boost energy independence, and ensure British taxpayers, bill-payers and communities reap the benefits of clean, secure, home-grown energy.

Last month, the landmark Great British Energy Act received Royal Assent and the first major project of the energy company has been to announce that it will be rolling out solar panels on over 400 schools and NHS sites across England, with funding also provided to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, as well as England’s metro mayors, to kickstart community energy projects right across the UK.

In England, around £80 million is being invested to support around 200 schools, alongside £100 million for nearly 200 NHS sites, covering a third of NHS trusts. Estimates suggest that the installation of Great British Energy’s solar panels could save a typical school up to £25,000 per year, whilst the average NHS site could save up to £45,000 per year on their annual energy bill. These savings mean that more money can be spent on the essentials that our schools and frontline services need.

I am glad that progress is being made on a national level, however, it is also important to highlight that important contributions can also be made locally. The Government has announced that £12m will be put aside for local authorities and community energy groups to build local clean energy projects – including onshore wind turbines, rooftop solar panels and hydropower.

We already have examples of similar schemes in our own town. Reading Borough Council has been helping more residents make the switch to solar power by allowing them to take advantage of competitive group-buying rates on solar panels and battery storage, and ‘Reading Hydro’ has been generating renewable, low-carbon electricity from the power of the River Thames since 2021.

I am proud of the actions that are being taken in our town to tackle the climate crisis, improve sustainability, and to make Reading a cleaner, greener place to live. The combined efforts of the council and its local partners has resulted in Reading being awarded an ‘A’ grade for its climate action by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for four years in a row. Our town is one of only 112 towns and cities worldwide, and one of only 19 other UK towns and cities, to have achieved this accolade for 2024.

I must also congratulate the efforts of Reading University, which have seen it recently been named the Sustainable University of the Year for 2025 in The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide.

These are the first projects approved in support of the new Indonesian Government's announced goal of reaching high-income status by 2045.

The US$1.5 billion policy reform program (Indonesia Productive and Sustainable Investment Development Policy Loan) will help strengthen Indonesia's financial sector by expanding the use of digital financial services, removing credit infrastructure constraints, expanding capital markets, adjusting to climate and natural disaster risks. It will also help remove obstacles to procuring renewable energy technologies by reducing local content requirements; align industrial estates policies with international good practice standards on environment and climate; and implement land value capture mechanisms to attract private capital into infrastructure development.

Complementing these market-enabling reforms, the blended finance program for Sustainable Least-Cost Electrification-2 (ISLE-2) will enable energy access to 3.5 million people and generation of 540 MW of solar and wind power. It is expected to reduce power generation costs by at least 8 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent in Kalimantan and Sumatra regions. This will be financed by a blended finance package including a US$600 million IBRD loan, US$12 million grants from the IBRD Surplus-Funded Livable Planet Fund and US$16 million in grants from partners mobilized under the Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative (SRMI), including a $6 million grant from the United Kingdom via the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and US$10 million from the Green Climate Fund SRMI-2 program. This energy program is also the first to pilot the World Bank's step-up loan product, whose financing structure offers Indonesia favorable interest rates for nine years with built-in incentives to attract private capital over time. It provides for a lower interest rate during implementation and the opportunity to reduce loan costs if it is refinanced after project completion. It is aligned with the World Bank Group's broader Originate to Distribute approach.

""The reforms and investments we are supporting with this blended finance package of over US$2 billion will help implement key government priorities and advance the Bank's own goals to create jobs and advance energy access in one of the largest and most dynamic economies,"" said Manuela V. Ferro, World Bank Vice President, East Asia and the Pacific. ""Through blended finance instruments, the World Bank and partners will also help mobilize an additional US$345 million in private investments to finance solar and wind project, as part of a World Bank Regional Energy program to create national and regional resilient and interconnected energy grids.""

Indonesia has enjoyed years of strong growth and adept fiscal management, even during COVID and in the context of slowing global demand. The new government's plans to invest in human capital, ensuring all Indonesians have access to electricity, and implementing financial sector reforms are being supported by the World Bank through knowledge and financing. The government is also establishing a deregulation committee that could unlock innovative financing approaches to attract private capital at scale.

With the ISLE-2 Project, the World Bank continues to support Indonesia in achieving universal access to electricity in a least cost manner.

(KTVI) — Last year, months before the mall in Chesterfield, Missouri, was set to close and demolition began, residents noticed hundreds of Tesla vehicles parked in the lot.

One of the few structures still standing after the mall’s mass demolition is a Dillard’s on the west side of the former mall grounds. In front of it, a sprawling parking lot where hundreds of Teslas are parked.

The parked vehicles include a variety of models in red, dark blue, gray, white, and black colors. Among them are dozens of Tesla Cybertrucks, a 2023 model with a triangular look and flat stainless steel panels that the company compares to a full-sized pickup truck.

But why are all of these Teslas parked outside a Dillard’s that is no longer open?

The Staenberg Group, one of the partners leading the mall’s demolition and redevelopment, told Nexstar’s KTVI that it’s part of a continuation of a lease that originally began before the mall shut its doors last August.

“Tesla has a short-term lease to park Tesla cars at Chesterfield Mall. We relocated them to the Dillard’s parcel when we started mall demolition,” said Tim Lowe, senior vice president of leasing and development for The Staenberg Group, in a statement to KTVI.

Lowe says the Dillard’s lot has recently held anywhere from 200 to 400 Tesla vehicles at a time.

The Teslas will likely remain there until Dillard’s begins renovations with long-term plans to reopen the store, KTVI has learned.

Michael Staenberg, president of The Staenberg Group, says Tesla is around six months into a roughly 32-month lease, keeping vehicles parked outside the Dillard’s.

Tesla’s nearest dealership is three miles away from the mall on Chesterfield Airport Road, just west of a shopping center with several retailers. Staenberg says the dealership currently does not have enough space to park its entire inventory, so the Dillard’s parking lot serves as a temporary overflow site.

Staenberg says security has not been a major issue. The Staenberg Group has installed security cameras to monitor activity and directs workers to patrol the grounds. Some entry points are also blocked off with orange traffic cones.

Tesla, Inc. is known for its battery-powered electric vehicles. Elon Musk, a billionaire with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and the chairman of the X social media platform, has served as the Tesla CEO since 2008.

Bioenergy in various forms – including biofuels, woody biomass, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (or BECCS) – are growing in prominence as purported energy and climate solutions, both as a potential source of renewable energy, and as means for carbon sequestration. However, scaling up of bioenergy poses serious risks to biodiversity, to socio-economic well-being, and to the climate itself. In many cases, far from being a climate solution, bioenergy is a dangerous distraction that can harm the climate and be used by industry to delay urgent climate action. Bioenergy is also a key feature of increasing calls for a new “bioeconomy”, set to gain increasing attention in the lead-up to and beyond COP30. While biomass is a scarce resource, the “bioeconomy” relies on it to serve huge and competing demands. With multiple interpretations of what the “bioeconomy” means, and a lack of clear definitions, extreme care is needed to ensure that the bioeconomy does not become a gateway for harmful bioenergy approaches. This CAN position paper refutes the idea that bioenergy can be a universal and significant “climate solution”. With few exceptions, bioenergy can only play a marginal role, and its limited use must be stringently regulated and controlled to avoid harm. What is bioenergy? In all forms of bioenergy, biological materials are burned with CO2 emissions as an unavoidable byproduct. While different bioenergy technologies may have different impacts and risks, they are almost always problematic and risky, particularly at scale. Biofuels Biofuels are derived from plants, algae or animal waste and can be both liquid and gaseous fuels. Most forms of biofuels pose significant risks and negative impacts for land, ecosystems and communities and the climate. First-generation biofuels include ethanol and biodiesel made from food crops such as corn, vegetable oils, and sugar cane. Second-generation biofuels include biogas, including production of methane through anaerobic digestion of manure – often from intensive livestock systems, biodiesel, and cellulosic ethanol derived from non-food biomass such as agricultural waste, wood, and algae. While biofuels can be used for heating, industrial processes, and electricity generation, massive growth scenarios are proposed as climate responses, particularly for the transportation sector. In the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, ‘sustainable aviation fuels (SAF)’ in the form of bio-kerosene (a type of liquid biofuel) represents 15% of the anticipated aviation fuel demand for 2030, and as high as 45% in 2050. Brazil already mandates a 27% 2 ethanol blend in gasoline with heavy reliance on sugarcane. The government intends to soon increase this to 30%, and already allows up to a 35% blend.

Woody biomass based bioenergy

Bioenergy from woody biomass includes both electricity and heat production from the burning of trees, shrubs, and roots, and can include wood from both natural forests and plantations. Large-scale forest-based bioenergy requires large land areas with inherent impacts on local populations and ecosystem health. Using forests for bioenergy results in immediate CO2 emissions, which may or may not be eventually absorbed by new trees. Cutting of forests also 4 releases large amounts of carbon stored in the soil. Over the timescales available to avoid runaway climate change, burning wood can be even worse than burning fossil fuels, essentially because doing so creates more emissions for the same amount of energy and because of how long it takes for trees to grow back. Even in best best-case scenarios, such uptake of CO2 takes decades or even centuries as trees grow slowly. This is clearly not compatible with a climate emergency where every addition of emissions over the next years and decades threatens to breach critical tipping points. Woody biomass bioenergy threatens the removal of standing forests as vital planetary carbon sinks on a huge scale at a critical time for the climate. Yet, woody biomass-based bioenergy is heavily promoted and assumed in numerous climate models and energy plans.5 For example, biomass already accounts for nearly 60% of the EU’s renewable energy consumption, surpassing the combined contribution of wind and solar energy, with solid bioenergy (woody biomass) constituting nearly 70% of this. Assessment for the new EU 6 Renewable Energy Directive outlines a ‘need’ to further increase bioenergy use from 2030 to 2050 by an average of 69% (where harvested stemwood would stay at current (high) levels and wood from residues and fast-growing crops would increase).7, 8 Countries are also co-firing woody biomass with coal, claiming this as ‘abatement’ of coal power emissions. This is an accounting trick, since the emissions remain as high or higher than before fuel substitution. Indonesia, as one example, has mandated co-firing biomass with coal at all 57 government-owned power stations (107 generators), which will drive massive conversion of natural forests to monoculture tree plantations. There is increasing pressure to halt this kind of accounting 9 scam.

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

BECCS is a form of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) geoengineering and combines two problematic technologies – bioenergy (generally from woody biomass) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The idea is premised on massively scaling-up the supply of biomass (e.g. through vast tree plantations, collection of forest ‘residues’ or agriculture waste), burning this biomass in large numbers of bioenergy power plants, and through extensive new infrastructure in the form of unproven, expensive and risky CCS technology capturing the CO2 emissions, transporting it and then injecting it underground. 11 This would need to be done on a vast scale to have any theoretical hope of sequestering enough CO2 to tangibly impact the global average temperature. In practice, impacts on forests and lost sequestration would hamper the assumed CO2 removal, and any negative emissions, if they occur, would likely be decades into the future. Yet, the technology is presented as a major vehicle for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) – with assumptions in IPCC reports reaching 5-10 Gt CO2 per year by 2050 and cumulative removals of 100-1000 Gt CO2 by the end of the century. While available 12 land is very limited, the landmass required for such removals equals the size of sub-continents.13 The CCS infrastructure would likely need to be on par with or surpass that of the current oil and gas infrastructure.

Other forms of Bioenergy

There are also examples of bioenergy which, if not carried out at scale, and if done appropriately, may be at less risk of creating harmful and perverse effects. These can include smallholder farmers’ growing of jatropha along farm boundary hedges in a way that does not conflict with land use or access; smallholder farmers’ use of animal or human waste to harness small-scale methane for cooking; municipal harnessing of human and compost waste methane to fuel buses and cars. CAN notes, however, that when these approaches are scaled up excessively, they can also create perverse incentives and harm – for example, the use of manure created by factory farming of livestock to create methane for energy use, thus giving the false appearance of “greening” and justifying a deeply damaging industry. CAN further notes that while domestic firewood use does add to emissions, and has negative health, environmental and socioeconomic impacts, it is in many parts of the world a traditional form of bioenergy that is often the only option available for billions of people living in poverty. CAN recognises the importance of rapid scaling up of energy access and transition to the electrification of cooking and other effective alternatives. This is a neglected priority that directly affects the wellbeing of a large part of the world’s population, particularly affecting women, children, and rural communities, and must be immediately prioritised. This is a matter of development and well-being more than a climate concern.

Bioenergy concerns

Threats to human rights and other socioeconomic harms

Bioenergy already incurs significant harm to communities and individuals across the world. Further expansion risks worsening human rights violations, health impacts, armed conflict, and climate injustice to communities who have done little to cause climate change but are already experiencing climate impacts most severely:

Conflicts over land are already prevalent, where more often than not, marginalised communities, smallholder farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and women are negatively impacted, with their territories often falsely deemed ‘marginal’ or ‘idle’ in order to justify land grabs. The projected, vast expansion of bioenergy could have negative/disastrous impacts on the human rights and livelihoods of billions of people.

As seen with earlier biofuel land grabs, bioenergy can have serious impacts on the right to food, as competition for land triggers rising food prices, 17

Plantations for bioenergy have a direct impact on water availability, and can lead to both conflict over water and water shortage, impacting the right to clean water and to sanitation.

Both the burning of biomass (for cooking and heating in homes and as fuel in power plants) as well as processing of biomass (such as the production of wood pellets) cause air pollution and respiratory diseases, often in socially disadvantaged communities.18 19

Bioenergy production, in combination with the generation of carbon credits, tends to compound the commodification of nature and drive local conflicts and land grabs. This puts Indigenous Peoples, communities, and individuals at risk of forced evictions, harming their right to adequate housing, among other potential human rights violations.

The enormous construction of pipelines, storage facilities, and other infrastructure required for large-scale BECCS would introduce new, significant problems related to land annexation, risks of accidents (e.g. rupturing pipelines), and CO2 leakage.20

The subsidization of anaerobic digesters for biogas production may put producers of factory-farmed livestock at a competitive advantage, exacerbating inequalities and putting smallholder farmers at risk. This threatens not only livelihoods but also local economies and food security.

Biodiversity and environmental harm

Bioenergy can have severe negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem health:

Intensified and existing pressures on natural forests and biodiverse ecosystems, many of which are home to declining or rare species, as short-term logging and harvesting of biomass get incentivised, and forest plantations are promoted.21

Further pressures to convert forests and biodiverse agriculture into monocultures of crops for biofuel production.22

Threats to marine ecosystem health from large-scale algae farming for the production of biofuels.

Increased pressure and incentives to apply artificial fertilisers to both croplands and forests in order to maximize yields for burning – with the risk of adverse effects on ecosystems and increased emissions from fertiliser production and application.

Deforestation, weakening of ecosystem integrity, and depletion of nutrients as biomass is extracted for burning – both in terms of industrial practices and for household use for both heating and cooking.23

Local environmental harms, public health risks, and public safety threats for communities near liquid biofuel refineries and biomass burning power plants.

Environmental and health harm from the CCS component of BECCS, as pipelines, bioenergy power plants, and other infrastructure, impact habitats, cause risk for pipeline leakage and explosions, and generate massive toxic waste pollution from CO2 scrubbing processes.

Harm to the climate

Most bioenergy approaches risk harming the climate far more than mitigating climate change, for the following reasons:

Liquid biofuels are usually portrayed as “carbon neutral” or low emissions. This is often wrong. In fact, over the course of their full life cycle, they can lead to higher GHG emissions than fossil fuels (known as the “carbon debt” of biofuels), due to the emissions released through production and application of synthetic fertilisers, deforestation, industrialised crop production and processing of crops into liquid biofuels. Furthermore, there is significant 24 variation in the reliability of biofuel Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs), as methodologies vary in their inclusion of direct and indirect land use change, non-CO2 GHGs, soil carbon, and other factors. This casts further doubt on claims of GHG reductions in biofuels. 25

Turning crops into biofuels makes no sense in climate terms when that land could be used to grow food instead. Neither does it make sense to burn wood instead of restoring natural carbon sinks such as forests. The opportunity cost for any action must always be considered.26

In animal agriculture, subsidizing the use of anaerobic digesters for biogas production could create perverse incentives to increase herd sizes, thus increasing emissions and often resulting in reduced space for animals (which also increases the risk of both established and novel zoonotic diseases).

Misleading claims that woody biomass-based bioenergy is ‘carbon neutral’. Burning wood instantly releases carbon dioxide, whereas forest regrowth to sequester this carbon can take decades or centuries. Moreover, there is no guarantee that new trees will grow back or survive – there may be new land uses or forests may burn. , The assumed carbon 27 28 sequestration is then lost, which would mean a net increase of emissions..

Cutting forests through clearcuts furthermore releases carbon stored in the soils, further adding to emissions.

Standing, old forests are excellent stocks and sinks, which generally absorb more carbon than young forests, and are essential for biodiversity and resilience to climate disasters.29 Promotion of bioenergy incentivises industry to cut such forests under false pretence of ‘climate action’.

Even burning dead trees is likely to increase emissions over climate-relevant timescales, because if left in situ, they would take a long time to decay. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre considers that burning ‘coarse woody debris’ (anything over 10 cm in diameter at the widest point) will likely increase emissions compared to fossil fuels for over 50 years.30

Furthermore, even residues such as sawdust and black liquor from sawmills, as well as trunks, stumps, and branches, are generally better used for higher economic value chain purposes, such as chemical industry use or wood panel production, than for burning.

Current accounting rules have created massive loopholes that result in increased emissions since the burning of biomass and biofuels are not counted as emissions (but rather buried in how countries report the change in land use). Countries are continuing to emit and, in essence, increasing their emissions from proliferating bioenergy while claiming and reporting climate progress.31

Bioenergy projects can also involve the generation of carbon credits , which are often 32 inappropriately used to offset ongoing emissions. CAN categorically rejects all forms of offsetting, which are in essence ‘permits to pollute’. Carbon credits generated from 33 bioenergy projects tend to cause double harm – allowing emissions from the burning of bioenergy and continued emissions by the buyer of the offset.

Co-firing biomass with coal as an alleged ‘abatement’ entrenches the use of coal whilst failing to reduce emissions and contributing to deforestation and forest degradation.

The assumed storage of CO2 for CCS/BECCS is often in old oil wells. Perversely, the pumping of CO2 into these old wells can help the fossil fuel industry to extract remaining oil or gas (this is already pursued under the rubric of ‘Enhanced Oil/Gas Recovery’ (EOR)). Any storage of CO2 would be rendered pointless and even cause net harm by the burning of the oil or gas released by the EOR. This is completely absurd. 34

Perhaps most significantly, the inclusion of bioenergy as a large share of countries’ and corporations’ climate targets leads to greenwashing and delayed action for real solutions.

Exceptions that prove the rule

CAN also recognises that there are exceptions that prove the rule, although there are only a very limited number of examples which are generally thought to avoid the issues raised above. One notable case here is sugar cane ethanol produced in Brazil, which, when produced on degraded former pasture land (which would otherwise act as a source of carbon emissions), can represent GHG reductions over a full life cycle when compared to fossil fuels. For such practices to be 36 acceptable overall, however, there needs to be clear socio-economic acceptability and no harmful environmental impacts. The fact that such examples are indeed few and far between underlines this paper’s key point that bioenergy is almost always harmful, and must not be viewed as a climate panacea. Limited exceptional cases must never be used to justify the adoption of bioenergy as a global climate solution.

CAN Principles / Recommendations

Given the inherent limitations of the various forms of bioenergy, their human rights, socio-economic and environmental risks, and not least their negative climate impacts, CAN concludes that bioenergy at scale is not a viable climate solution. Current projections and plans for bioenergy by governments and corporations constitute a severe dangerous distraction from the real solutions we must rapidly implement. In light of this, CAN demands that:

Bioenergy must not be portrayed and promoted as a significant and universal climate solution. Any role that bioenergy can play will be inherently limited by climate, biodiversity, and socio-economic constraints, and thus peripheral to the necessary focus on ambitious climate transformation.

Bioenergy approaches must not be used as a substitute or reason to delay real and urgent climate action, such as ending fossil and other carbon-emitting fuels. Bioenergy in its various forms cannot be central components for ambitious climate action.

The practice of co-firing biomass with coal as an alleged form of abatement of coal power is not acceptable.

Countries and corporations must immediately revise their plans and targets and eliminate their reliance on biofuels, woody biomass, and BECCS, including in their NDCs. The resulting gap must be filled by environmentally and socially appropriate renewable energy and by reducing overconsumption. The gap cannot be covered by dangerous distractions such as geoengineering or other false solutions.

Existing production and use of bioenergy from forest biomass, dedicated crop-based biofuels, and biomass from secondary wastes or residues (that can be used by local industries for bio-based products) must be phased out, including by ending subsidies, tax exemptions, and other incentives. This means strict enforcement of the cascading and waste hierarchy principles.

The Bioeconomy concept must be clearly defined and restricted to not include reliance on and promotion of bioenergy, biofuels, or biomass (or indeed other harmful practices).

The practice of offsetting must not be further legitimised and promoted. Bioenergy shall under no circumstances be connected with and fuelling offsetting practices.

Bioenergy must not be included and relied upon as significant elements in climate and energy modelling. The heavy prominence of assumed, future use of BECCS in many of the IPCC’s Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) is not appropriate.

The environmental, infrastructure and health costs and limitations of large-scale BECCS must be further documented and substantiated. It is well established that BECCS has essentially functioned as a ‘black box’ in IAMs, filling in the gaps in projected climate action to make climate targets look more easily achievable without radical, transformative action.

Current accounting rules under UNFCCC and other regimes (e.g. IPCC, EU) must be overhauled to transparently count emissions from bioenergy in the location and sector where they take place.

A rapid transition to people-centred and appropriate electrification of cooking must be prioritised, supported, and financed based on clear equity and climate justice principles, as a priority health and development imperative.

What's happening?

U.S. coastal communities are bracing for what forecasters say will be an active Atlantic hurricane season. Between 1991 and 2020, the average number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes per year was 14.4, 7.2, and 3.2, respectively.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has placed the probability of an above-normal season at 60%. The NOAA is predicting 13-19 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes.

Colorado State University's forecast concurs with the NOAA's. The university has issued seasonal Atlantic hurricane forecasts for over 40 years. CSU is forecasting 17 named storms, 14.4 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. CSU also maps out the chances of a hurricane impacting our country's coastline.

Louisiana's coast has a 46% probability of being impacted by a hurricane this year. ""If you could run this exact season 100 times under identical conditions, coastal Louisiana would get hit by a hurricane about 46 of those times,"" New Talk 96.5 KPEL said.

Only Florida's coastline has a greater chance of being affected by a hurricane than Louisiana's. The threat from hurricanes isn't confined to just the coast. Inland portions of Louisiana have around a 35% chance of experiencing the effects of a hurricane this year.

Why is the probability of a hurricane in Louisiana important?

The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information's database for billion-dollar weather and climate disasters includes 27 tropical cyclone events from 1980 to 2024 that have incurred costs of $200-300 billion.

Damage from tropical storms and hurricanes makes up the vast majority of costs brought on by severe weather in Louisiana. Tropical cyclones accounted for 86% of the total costs from billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in the state over 35 years.

Over the past 20 years, hurricanes have been the fifth leading weather-related cause of death in the U.S., according to National Weather Service statistics. NOAA cited warmer-than-average ocean temperatures as a factor that influenced this year's above-average hurricane season forecast.

Our warming world is supercharging all types of storms, including hurricanes. While there have always been extreme weather events, the human-induced climate crisis makes them more frequent and powerful. Nonprofit Climate Central's analysis of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season found that all eleven hurricanes that formed last year had stronger winds as a result of our overheating planet.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the third-deadliest hurricane in U.S. history, which struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005. Nearly 80% of the city was flooded as several of the city's levees were breached. It was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.

Supercharged extreme weather events can cause expensive damage to homes and businesses, increase insurance premiums, and lead to injuries or even death.

How are people preparing for hurricanes?

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has a guide on how to best prepare for hurricanes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers advice on how to get ready for any future tropical cyclone that might strike.

Another critical federal program is also at risk.

These changes would only add to the mounting problems for Tesla.

Tesla has long been a volatile stock, but it's also become a very controversial name in recent months. Shares trade at a pricey valuation with a market cap of roughly $1 trillion, fueled by the promise of greater electric vehicle sales and a potential new robotaxi business. Yet sales growth for the company is struggling across many key geographies with CEO Elon Musk often making headlines for all the wrong reasons.

Watch what happens with Trump's new bill

A recent bill backed by President Donald Trump proposes eliminating tax credits for electric vehicles. These tax credits range from $4,000 to $7,500 for qualified vehicles. Right now, more than 90% of Tesla's sales come from just two models: The Model 3 and Model Y. Both qualify for federal tax credits, making them much more affordable for buyers. Surveys show that more than one-third of Tesla buyers wouldn't have purchased their vehicle without a tax credit.

Monitor what happens to these figures closely. Will federal incentives drop to $0, or will they be reduced significantly? The fate of these tax credits is very unclear right now, but their elimination would likely further dampen Tesla's sales growth in the quarters and years to come.

As troubling as the loss of the EV tax credit would be, there's another number to track that could be even more influential.

Last quarter, Tesla posted a $409 million net profit. That profit was partially realized by $595 million in automotive regulatory credits -- accrued credits that Tesla sells to competitors that need to comply with emission standards. Most of these credits are likely earned under state programs, but some are generated from federal programs. If these programs are cut, Tesla will lose a critical revenue source with nearly 100% profit margins.

Addressing an official event to mark the occasion, Joshi said: “Our national goals are ambitious and clear, with a target of 50 per cent of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals.

Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy, but it is at the heart of it and at the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat.” “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given us a vision to have renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption,” the minister pointed out.

“India’s manufacturing capacity is increasing, and it will continue to increase. In view of this, the Prime Minister’s vision stresses the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub in the near future, the country should be able to fulfil the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources,” Joshi observed.

India has a huge potential in the renewable energy sector, with the fourth largest wind power installed capacity in the world, and it is also the third largest renewable energy producer. “No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality,” Joshi said.

The minister underlined the three key issues for the wind energy sector, saying: “First, we must combine wind with solar and storage (BESS) to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability. Secondly, tariffs must be competitive.

A rate of Rs 3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs, and thirdly, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports.” Underlining the dedicated efforts from the Centre to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, he said: “The government is backing this sector with full seriousness.

This year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53 per cent to Rs 26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.” “The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome.

This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,” the minister added. “I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies.

These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.” The minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, a coordinated national push is required, for which the Centre is focusing on five priorities.

These include expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha, launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and tenders being readied.

Apart from this, the government is integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models, modernising the grid, and investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy. It is also taking steps to boost local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain.

The Union Minister also released reports on the ‘Wind Energy Roadmap’ and ‘Manufacturing Roadmap’ at the event. He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Atma Nirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India.

The best-performing states in terms of wind capacity addition were also felicitated at the event.

European drivers have been shifting their attention away from Tesla and toward other EV automakers like the Chinese brand BYD.

Drivers in Europe's largest car market, Germany, are also steering clear of Teslas.

What's happening?

As The New York Times reported, Tesla sales in Germany declined for the fifth month in a row. Tesla registrations in Germany decreased by over one-third, comparing May 2025 to May 2024.

But while this news is bad for Tesla, there's good news for electric vehicle ownership in general. Europeans are buying more EVs and embracing clean-energy driving more than ever before.

In May, EV sales grew by almost 45% in Germany, while they increased by 72% in Spain. This impressive EV growth raises questions about Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statement when he said, ""The European car market is quite weak.""

Why are Tesla's European sales important?

This news from Germany follows global trends of declining Tesla sales, which many analysts link to Musk's political activities in the U.S. and in Europe. Despite Tesla's efforts to innovate and adapt its European product offerings, anti-Tesla sentiments are strong among enough of the population that it cuts into the company's sales.

Beyond Europe and the U.S., many other markets, including China and Australia, are seeing massive Tesla sales declines. Meanwhile, protests and vandalism are prevalent.

Since many people associate electric vehicles with the Tesla brand, negative opinions about this one automaker could discourage people from buying any EV. However, our future sustainability depends on cutting our reliance on pollution-heavy forms of transportation and curbing the planet's overheating gases from tailpipe fumes.

What's being done to advance EV ownership worldwide?

Despite Tesla sales declines, it's encouraging to learn that overall EV ownership is expanding, with more drivers interested in buying EVs to save money and help the environment.

Government incentives like rebates and tax credits have convinced many drivers to give EVs a try. Also, technological developments in battery lifespan and charging infrastructure make it easier for people to switch to EVs without range anxiety.

Used EVs offer affordable options for drivers, and an increasing number of auto manufacturers now offer EVs as part of their lineup. If you decide a Tesla isn't for you, perhaps a Volkswagen, BYD, Cadillac, Rivian, Honda, BMW, or Chevy might fit best with your budget, lifestyle, and sustainability goals.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-recFVJCqGD8J8MF7H.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 21:59:46.763955

Introduction to NGFS and its Focus

The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was established in 2017 and is a voluntary commitment from a group of Central Bankers and Supervisors to develop and share best practices and contribute to environmental and climate risk management in the financial sector.

The NGFS consists of 145 members across 90 countries, with 22 observers. Membership covers 100% of global systemic banks and 80% of international active insurance groups. The latest NGFS works focus on climate-related shocks that, according to Morgan Stanley, could have “significant economic disruptions within five years”.

The significance of this work lays in the near-term nature of the time frame, which encompasses the usual holding period for investors, opposed to longer-term frameworks and models up to 2050.

The scenarios modeled are “Highway to Paris” ,“Sudden Wake-Up Call”, “Diverging Realities” and “Disasters and Policy Stagnation” ; all are designed to allow investors to consider and risk-adjust possible outcomes out to 2030.

Scenario Summaries by Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley’s summary for the scenarios is as follows:

-Highway to Paris: Transition risk only, orderly transition including carbon taxes reinvested into green subsidies and investments. Short-term impacts on economic growth are offset by higher returns on investment, with consumers and investors tilting toward the green sector. High-polluting sectors will experience rising credit risks and capital costs.

-Sudden Wake-Up Call: Transition risk only, disorderly transition. A scenario in which there is a “Climate Minsky Moment” when a wave of financial instability arises as asset prices adjust quickly to a sudden alteration in policy preferences to a green focus. A steep rise in carbon prices results in supply shocks.

-Diverging Realities: Both transition and physical risk. The bifurcation of the world with developed economies advancing to net-zero transition (North America, Europe, Oceania, and parts of Asia) contrasted with the rest of the world beset by extreme weather events, which impact global trade, supply chains, and spillover to the developed economies’ cost of transition.

-Disasters and Policy Stagnation: Physical risk only. Extreme weather events transpire over 2026 and 2027 resulting in capital destruction, lower productivity, and flow-on economic impacts.

Economic Impact Summary

Summarising the possible impacts across multiple factors, Morgan Stanley details:

-GDP will decline by up to -2.68% under Diverging Realities, with the Highway to Paris scenario at -0.46% GDP impact by 2030.

-Renewable energy investment increases by 79% to around US$800bn by 2030 in both Highway to Paris and Sudden Wake-Up Call from a baseline of US$214bn. Under Diverging Realities, investment rises 45% to US$292bn.

-The weighted carbon price under a baseline scenario in 2030 is US$54, but NGFS estimates under Sudden Wake-Up Call, the weighted carbon price would rise to US$163 in 2030.

-Credit risk significantly rises for high-emission sectors in Highway to Paris, Sudden Wake-Up Call, and Diverging Realities, while credit risk for green sectors falls in Highway to Paris due to increased investments.

-Physical risk causes short-term spikes in default probabilities across all sectors, with capital-intensive sectors like coal production, power supply, and agriculture being notably impacted.

-Trade overall is negatively affected in physical risk scenarios and becomes more severe and long-lasting in the Diverging Realities scenario.

Corporate ESG News in May

Macquarie’s Australian monthly ESG focus detailed some of the latest corporate updates, including SGH Ltd‘s ((SGH)) Investor Day, where the company formerly known as Seven Group Holdings outlined its revised emission targets due to the inclusion of Boral.

SGH’s interim target for Scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity reductions from the FY20 base year out to FY30 is -40% for Westrac, -30% for Boral, and -40% for Coates.

The company’s ambition to achieve net-zero has been pushed out to 2050 from 2040 previously.

Macquarie has observed several companies revising emission targets due to challenges around the cost of projects, skilled labour availability, and delays in transmission infrastructure. The analyst will be looking over the August reporting season for any further evidence of this trend gaining momentum.

Westpac’s Updated Climate Change Position

Westpac ((WBC)) outlined at the end of May an updated Climate Change Position Statement, which included customer transition plans for the metallurgical coal and coal-fired power generation sectors (previously it was only required for the oil and gas sector).

The bank removed the commitment to not provide project finance or bond facilitation for the expansion of oil and gas fields, with a restriction remaining on greenfield oil and gas projects.

Regarding the customer transition plan criteria for lending and bond facilitation, Westpac has moved to allow alignment to a “well below 2 degrees Celsius pathway” from 1.5 degrees Celsius previously.

Compared to CommBank ((CBA)) and National Australia Bank ((NAB)), which also require transition plans to align well below the 2 degrees Celsius pathway, ANZ Bank ((ANZ)) is now the only major bank requiring 1.5 degrees Celsius alignment.

Macquarie also notes the Net Zero Banking Alliance has softened its requirement on 1.5 degrees Celsius alignment to the goal of well below two degrees Celsius, similar to Westpac.

Environmental News in May: US Legislative Actions on Green Tax Credits

The US House of Representatives narrowly passed a tax bill, known as the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ which proposes the early termination and phase-out of green tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy production, consumption, manufacturing, and investment.

-Tax credits for electric vehicles, clean hydrogen, home energy efficiency improvements, and clean energy tax credits will expire at the end of 2025.

-Wind energy components will no longer be eligible for credits from 2028, while tax credits for the manufacturing of components of clean energy will expire from 2032.

-Clean energy production and investment credits will only be available for facilities under construction and in service by the end of 2028.

-Tax credits for carbon sequestration are maintained, with credits for low-carbon transportation fuels extended by four years to the end of 2031.

The tax bill is now being considered by the US Senate, and the aim is to deliver the bill to President Trump by July 4.

Interestingly, since the Inflation Reduction Act in late 2022, some US$321bn has been invested in clean manufacturing, power production, and industrial facilities, Macquarie explains, with an outstanding US$522bn of investments.

In terms of Australia, there is longer-term opportunity, but the analyst proposes subsidies would be needed to make the economics of low-carbon energy technologies like green hydrogen commercially possible.

Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme (ACCU)

The Australian Government’s new draft Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme’s (ACCU) landfill gas method outlines the rules for crediting emission reductions from landfills, with Cleanaway Waste Management ((CWY)) the only listed company with landfill gas abatement project exposure at its Banksia, Kemps Creek, Stawell, and New Churn LFG (landfill gas) flaring projects.

Turning to renewable energy projects, VicGrid released the first draft of the 2025 Victorian Transmission Plan for the next 15 years, including seven renewable energy zones and four new transmission lines to assist Victoria’s transition to 65% renewables by 2030 and 95% by 2035.

Regarding Future Made in Australia, the government announced $46m in funding to scale up the production of Maverick solar units at an Adelaide facility as part of the $1bn Solar Shot Program, which will enable 200MW production over three years and underpin 50 jobs.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Back in Focus

Renewed interest in carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the US is largely being underpinned by future growth expectations for data centers. Morgan Stanley estimates the carbon footprint from global data center build-outs to be 2.5Gt by 2030.

Within that context, the analyst believes hyperscalers will retain their commitment to try to achieve net-zero emissions, including further investment in clean tech solutions with CCS a possibility as gas-fired power generation is one of the solutions to energy generation for data centers.

The pipeline of CCS in the US is estimated to advance to 556Mtpa of capacity by 2030, with 17mtpa expected in 2025, with support from the 45Q tax credit, which has been retained in the recent IRA cut.

Natural gas production, processing, and power generation are the greatest industry emission sources, with an estimated 23% contribution to total pipeline capacity.

US legislation also allows for state primacy over Class VI permits (CO2 injection). The primacy enables states to initiate the planning process for wells. West Virginia is the fourth state to obtain primacy, following North Dakota, Wyoming, and Louisiana. Arizona and Texas are in the last stages of obtaining primacy.

In Europe, Morgan Stanley explains the interest in CCS emanates from the incoming carbon adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which is due to commence in 2026.

The aim of CBAM is to move decarbonisation beyond the power sector to industrial sectors as carbon-free allowances are phased out. Cement production is one example where CCS is the only solution given current technologies to remove emissions.

In terms of stocks classified as ‘proprietary technology providers’ and ‘capture solutions providers’, which have the highest exposure to the technology, the stocks rated by Morgan Stanley as Overweight include Baker Hughes, Bloom Energy, Chart Industries, Exxon, GE Vernova, Linde, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Occidental, and Shell.

Australian Election Results and Transition Roadmap

With a super catchy title “Ready, Set, Transition”, UBS emphasizes the re-election of the Australian Labor Party “cements” Australia’s transition roadmap to 2030.

By way of history, in 2022, the government legislated a reduction in emissions target of -42% by 2030 with a target for renewable energy of 82% by 2030.

Currently, Australia has 40% renewable energy, with the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) seeking to underscore 23GW of new renewables generation and 9GW of storage, which will cover the gap to the 82% target.

UBS continues to envisage support for renewable energy capacity for AGL Energy ((AGL)), Origin Energy ((ORG)), and grid-exposed companies Downer EDI ((DOW)) and APA Group ((APA)).

Flow of Funds

RBA Capital highlights ongoing outflows from sustainable equity funds in 2025, although outflows have slowed from March lows, with headwinds for US funds due to the more challenging political backdrop and volatility for European funds due to the continued implementation of (anti)greenwashing regulations.

Europe represents around 80% of sustainable funds, and the analyst views this geography will determine the trends.

Climate transition funds continue to see inflows for 2025 based on thematic, with outflows notably more robust for Impact/SDG (Sustainable Development Goals), Clean Energy, and Environmental Solutions funds.

Outflows have been slowing for Health & Wellbeing, Sustainable Ag & Food, and Circular Economy funds.

The Nuclear Power theme was a standout in May, with most energy transition themes outperforming in the first half of the year to date, but faded when the US budget reconciliation bill was passed due to cuts to clean energy tax credits.

In terms of performance, actively managed global and US sustainable funds slightly outperformed traditional fund peers, but overall, sustainable funds are lagging year-to-date versus traditional funds.

The Indiana Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1393 on Friday cited the “continued refusal to agree to a fair labor contract” by Duke.
“Duke Energy has refused to budge from what it called its ‘best and final offer,’ rejecting multiple reasonable proposals from the union,” the union said in a news release.
“In fact, we started negotiations with 1,065 members; we’re down to 987.
Duke Energy provided the following statement on Friday: “The work of our International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1393 (IBEW) represented employees is highly valued to the company, our customers, and the communities we serve.","Nearly 1,000 union workers at Duke Energy Indiana are preparing for what they’re calling an “imminent work stoppage” over a contract dispute with the Plainfield-based utility.

The Indiana Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1393 on Friday cited the “continued refusal to agree to a fair labor contract” by Duke.

The union said its previous labor agreement expired on May 1, and workers have continued working under the terms of the old contract since then.

Key issues among members, according to the union, are equitable wage increases and addressing ongoing concerns over rising health insurance costs over the life of a potential new agreement.

“Duke Energy has refused to budge from what it called its ‘best and final offer,’ rejecting multiple reasonable proposals from the union,” the union said in a news release. “Duke continues to prioritize shareholder dividends over the health, safety, and quality of life of its essential workforce—many of whom are stretched thin and working excessive hours to keep the lights on.”

Christopher Wilson, business manager and financial secretary for IBEW Local 1393, said Duke has previously boasted about record profit, including a 22% increase in earnings in the first quarter of 2025.

Wilson told Inside INdiana Business that the union primarily wants to create a better quality of life for its members.

“We’ve seen our workforce be completely depleted,” Wilson said. “In fact, we started negotiations with 1,065 members; we’re down to 987. If we go back to 2013, we’ve lost over 250 members. The majority proposals [by] company at these negotiations were to force those a few remaining employees to work more hours.”

Wilson added that Duke’s proposals would not provide any additional incentives related to health care contributions or retirement plans.

“[We’re] trying to make sure that our members are not only being able to provide the quality service that they’re doing, but also be able enjoy that time with their family. And right now, we’re just being stretched then, to be quite honest,” he said.

Duke Energy provided the following statement on Friday:

“The work of our International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1393 (IBEW) represented employees is highly valued to the company, our customers, and the communities we serve. Our goal during negotiations is to achieve a mutually favorable labor agreement with the IBEW that provides fair compensation, competitive benefits and a safe work environment.”

Duke provides electricity to about 900,000 customers in 69 Indiana counties.

Wilson said the members who have left in recent years have done so for more favorable contracts with other utility companies and cooperatives.

“Our average age has dropped five years. Our average years of service has dropped from 16 years of service in 2014 all the way down to 11,” he said. “So we’re having less experience out there, and we’re putting more on those individuals, and there’s no relief inside. So guys are looking for other opportunities. They’re going to the REMCs who still have traditional pension and 401(k) matches with better wages than what we’re currently experiencing.”

Wilson said about 90% of the union’s membership turned out to vote on the authorization to strike on Friday, with the vote being “almost unanimous.”

The union is working toward a work stoppage, he said, but is reaching out to Duke Energy to get back to the negotiating table to avoid a strike. The union has also contacted the U.S. Department of Labor and federal mediators.

In the event that Duke does not agree to continue contract negotiations, Wilson said a strike could happen as early as the first or second week of July.",http://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/134968173_web1_20220509dj-duke-plainfield.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 20:02:49.637278

Indeed, the U.S. accounts for less than 1% of the world’s uranium output, with Kazakhstan, Canada, and Namibia accounting for nearly two-thirds of global production.
The country’s nuclear age peaked in the 1960s to the mid-1980s when it was the leader in uranium production.
It all began three years ago, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggering a global energy crisis and driving energy prices to historic highs.
Suddenly, governments everywhere started encouraging more nuclear energy production to boost national energy security.","For decades, the United States has been the world’s biggest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for 30% of global production. The country, however, currently imports 98% of the uranium feedstock it needs to power its 94 nuclear reactors. Indeed, the U.S. accounts for less than 1% of the world’s uranium output, with Kazakhstan, Canada, and Namibia accounting for nearly two-thirds of global production.

But things have not always been this way. The country’s nuclear age peaked in the 1960s to the mid-1980s when it was the leader in uranium production. The downtrend that followed can largely be chalked up to government policy, with Washington de-prioritizing away from the uranium sector, including providing less government funding and subsidies to support it over the years. Meanwhile, several high-profile nuclear accidents took a heavy toll on public perception and tanked uranium prices, forcing many domestic uranium producers to shutter operations.

However, the U.S. is now enjoying a nuclear renaissance, with the sector seeing a resurgence in recent years. Last year, the country produced almost 700,000 pounds of yellowcake, good for a more than a dozen-fold increase from the previous year, thanks to surging uranium prices and favorable government policies. It all began three years ago, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggering a global energy crisis and driving energy prices to historic highs. Suddenly, governments everywhere started encouraging more nuclear energy production to boost national energy security. Meanwhile, the rise of AI data centers, clean energy manufacturing and the cryptocurrency boom triggered a spike in global electricity demand, putting more pressure on power producers. In 2024, the Biden administration provided $2.7 billion in federal funding to expand the country’s uranium enrichment and conversion capacity, shortly after banning the import of Russian uranium. A month ago, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders that will speed up the deployment of nuclear reactors with a goal to quadruple the nation’s nuclear output from 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050.

Finally, the long-dormant uranium mining industry is sputtering to life. Normally, it would typically take years for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to review plans to reopen shuttered uranium mines; however, the bureau’s regulators green-lit the reopening of Anfield Energy’s Velvet-Wood mine in just 11 days, citing a “national energy emergency”. Canada’s Anfield Energy is also looking to reopen the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill after a 40-year shutdown. Uranium mills convert raw uranium ore into yellowcake, a powdery substance that is later processed into nuclear fuel.

“President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security. These emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

Energy Fuels (NYSE:UUUU), another Canadian company, opened the Pinyon Plain mine, located 10 miles from the Grand Canyon, two years ago. Meanwhile, TerraPower is currently building a 345-megawatt fast reactor outside Kemmerer in western Wyoming. More fast approvals for uranium mines are likely on the way, with Trump’s order also applying to oil, gas, coal, hydropower and biofuels--but not renewable energy.

However, the experts are warning that it will take many years before the United States’s uranium mining sector returns to its dominance of yesteryears, if ever, “Even if all the uranium projects in the United States that are currently permitted and operable, we could not satisfy the demand of the United States of America,” says Mark Chalmers, president and CEO of Energy Fuels. The volume of yellowcake that the country churned out in 2024 still falls far short of the 32 million pounds it imported, highlighting the magnitude of the task ahead.

The biggest obstacle to the country realizing its nuclear dream is the fact that the U.S. is home to less than 1% of global uranium reserves. Washington could, however, pursue uranium substitutes like thorium. Thorium comes with key advantages over uranium, including the fact that it produces less waste, has a much higher energy density (one ton of thorium can produce roughly the same amount of energy as 35 to 200 tons of uranium), is meltdown-proof and has no weapons-grade by-products. As an added bonus, thorium reactors can even consume legacy plutonium stockpiles.

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has developed a thorium-based nuclear fuel dubbed ANEEL (Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life). ANEEL is a proprietary combination of “High Assay Low Enriched Uranium” (HALEU) and thorium fuel for pressurized heavy-water reactors (PHWRs), which intends to address high costs and toxic waste issues. Early safety tests of ANEEL by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have been successful, with irradiated pellets maintaining their structure and integrity after achieving a burnup of 25 gigawatt-days per ton. The tests will continue until spring 2026 wherein the fuel will be studied under higher burnups.

DETROW: That is NPR's Rob Schmitz, with a view of what one city is doing as it prepares for a change in climate.","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

When it comes to climate change, it's often cities at the leading edge of preparing for the future. So we're going to take a look now at Copenhagen, Denmark, a city where a single storm 14 years ago prompted it to make big changes. NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz joins us now to tell the rest of the story. Hey, Rob.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: So let's start with that storm. Five inches of rain sounds like a lot, but when you compare that to hurricanes, you know, here in the U.S., it does kind of pale in comparison.

SCHMITZ: Right.

DETROW: How did that amount of rain cause so much problems?

SCHMITZ: Yeah, there are a couple reasons for that. First off, for those who've been to Copenhagen, you know that, A, it is flat, and B, it is built along the Baltic Sea. It's an ancient port. So when it rains there, water doesn't really have anywhere to go because it's at sea level. Secondly, the rainstorm that hit the city on July 2, 2011, was not your normal storm.

DETROW: Yeah, the scientists you talked to called it a cloudburst. What exactly...

SCHMITZ: Right.

DETROW: ...Does that mean?

SCHMITZ: So in a normal thunderstorm, you've got strong winds moving up, and this circulation of air inside the clouds leads to sort of a towering peak at the top. And in a cloudburst, you have similar mechanics, but one key difference meteorologists told me is the temperature. It's warmer in the clouds that make up a cloudburst, and that, says Danish Meteorological Institutes' Mark Payne, is a result of a warming climate.

MARK PAYNE: As the Earth's climate warms, the air obviously becomes warmer, and warmer air can hold more water. And at the same time, this more water evaporates from the oceans and comes up into the atmosphere.

SCHMITZ: And Scott, Payne says for every degree Celsius of warming, the atmosphere holds 7% more water. And in a cloudburst event, you've got a big storm cloud heavy with water, and at some point, it just dumps that water over a tight space in a short period of time. So those 5 inches of rain that fell on Copenhagen in that 2011 storm fell within a few hours. And it flooded the city, causing sewer lines to rupture, filling the streets with raw sewage. It was a total mess.

DETROW: That does not sound good.

SCHMITZ: No.

DETROW: So going forward, Copenhagen cleans itself up, and it goes straight to work to make sure it would be better prepared. Tell us what they did.

SCHMITZ: Yeah, so a year later, Copenhagen approved a $1.3 billion public works project to complete 300 flood mitigation projects throughout the city over the next two decades.

DETROW: What are some of those projects?

SCHMITZ: So the first project is a series of seven tunnels that were dug under the city. I went down inside one of them as a crew was putting the finishing touches on it. This particular tunnel is nearly a mile long and 10 feet in diameter. It's designed to hold four Olympic swimming pools' worth of water. And in the event of a big storm, rainwater would be funneled into it, and then it would be pumped out of the tunnel into the sea.

DETROW: I'm picturing this - it's just kind of like a large storm drain with a pump.

SCHMITZ: That's right. And in addition to these tunnels, Copenhagen has also transformed 20 parks and green spaces in the city so that each of them can turn into big reservoirs in the event of a flood. The city did this by digging into these parks, creating soccer fields and play spaces that are sunken into the parks. In one of these parks I visited, they also built a 3-foot-high concrete wall around it, and the gates that allow people into the park automatically rise out of the ground, sealing the wall shut so that the park becomes, like, this massive lake when it floods. So these types of parks - they're called sponge parks - are now found throughout Copenhagen. And the largest project the city is building is a man-made island just off the coast to protect the city from an increasing number of storm surges that can also cause flooding.

DETROW: That is NPR's Rob Schmitz, with a view of what one city is doing as it prepares for a change in climate. Thank you so much.

SCHMITZ: Thank you.

Unlike the House's version, which would require states to share 5% of SNAP costs, the Senate's proposal eliminates this requirement, although states with high error rates would still need to share costs.
These modifications mean that savings from SNAP changes would be approximately $20 billion less than the House version.
The House version, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, raised the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged that 'they need the votes in the House' and are looking for ways to adjust these provisions.","As the U.S. Senate races against the clock to meet President Donald Trump's July 4 deadline for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' significant changes are being considered to the version passed by the House of Representatives. The overarching goal is to control government costs and place federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, potentially marking the 'largest mandatory spending cut in history.' However, the details are still being ironed out, with senators meeting to discuss updates that could be adjusted at the last minute.

The complexity of the task is underscored by Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, who described the process as 'a 3,000-piece puzzle without a picture.' Among the key provisions taking shape in the Senate is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Senator John Boozman, a Republican from Arkansas and chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has indicated that the bill will include changes to reduce the burden on states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal.

Unlike the House's version, which would require states to share 5% of SNAP costs, the Senate's proposal eliminates this requirement, although states with high error rates would still need to share costs. Additionally, work requirements for families with young children to qualify for SNAP would change, now applying to families with children over 10 years old, instead of those over 7. These modifications mean that savings from SNAP changes would be approximately $20 billion less than the House version.

Another significant area of discussion is the cap on State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions. The House version, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, raised the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000. However, senators have suggested plans to reduce this cap. Although a specific new cap has not been agreed upon, senators have indicated that the number will be 'well below $40,000.'

For Senate Republicans, reducing the SALT cap is an 'easy win' to cut costs from the bill, given that there are few Republican senators from states with high state and local taxes. However, this measure could create a 'dangerous path' in the House, as several centrist Republicans have 'threatened to withdraw their support' if the Senate modifies the cap. Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged that 'they need the votes in the House' and are looking for ways to adjust these provisions.

Border funding is another contentious issue. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky and one of the Senate's biggest fiscal hawks, is responsible for charting a path for the package's border provisions. Paul has advocated for reducing the amount of money allocated to border security, suggesting that the real cost of building a wall should be assessed instead of accepting the initially proposed $150 billion. While some of his colleagues agree, others, like Senator Lindsey Graham, consider Paul's figures 'simply unrealistic.'

Changes to Medicaid remain an 'unknown.' Thune is working to align Republicans on Medicaid cuts, especially with members like Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who has set a 'red line' on this issue for his support of the bill. The House made an effort to limit the use of provider taxes, which Thune said have been 'manipulated.' The Senate seeks to build on this but needs to secure the necessary votes in both chambers.

Thune has stated that the program 'is ripe for reform' and should be available only to its intended recipients, excluding undocumented immigrants or able-bodied working-age men without work requirements.

According to recent data by the EPA, Texas ranks poorly when it comes to air pollution.

On Tuesday, the North Central Texas Council of Governments met to break down the ongoing concern.

North Texas cities are experiencing a population boom, and Ian Seamans, an environmental expert, says as more people move to the Lone Star State, environmental factors must be taken seriously.

“In the last several years, we have seen smog increasing in the DFW area, not decreasing,” said Seamans with Environment Texas.

According to data released by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, North Texas is facing an uptick in Ozone Action Days.

Getting to a decent standard of air quality is something leaders in the DFW area are trying to work on. Environmental experts like Seamans say ground-level ozone negatively affects the health of people and the environment.

“As the North Texas region grows, we are exposing more kids, more elderly people and more people with lung disease to this smoggy polluted air,” Seamans said.

Several meetings in North Texas have presented data showing the decline in air quality across our region, specifically in areas like Dallas, Tarrant and Denton counties.

Chris Klaus focuses on air quality management in North Texas with the North Central Texas Council of Governments and said getting the air cleaner should be a priority.

“It’s taken us way longer than it’s been objectively asked for by the clean air act,” Klaus said. “Right now, we’re in June and in the beginning of the ozone season, it’s not super hot out there yet but when the dog days of summer come around August, we may have a lot of ozone activity so for those in the region to be aware of that.”

For the past two years, the North Texas Council of Governments has gathered air quality data.

The troubling results have prompted officials to draft a short-term plan to reduce greenhouse gas emission in the surrounding area.

“We have actually over time reduced our emissions significantly, but recently it’s stalled and starting to go back up again,” Klaus said. “It could be new engine controls on automobiles, but definitely could possibly be the increase in population.”

According to the latest data, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex saw more than 43 ozone alerts in 2024.

Environmental experts are blaming a combination of things from large refineries to more vehicles like tractor-trailers on the road.

“What is currently being proposed by TCEQ is implementing a penalty that is required by law from the Clean Air Act. This penalty is intended to stop polluters from polluting our air with smog,” Seamans said.

As North Texas leaders work to figure out a solution to decrease smog, environmentalists like Seamans say if nothing changes, government agencies risk facing a $45 million fine for every year it is in violation.

“Under the Clean Air Act, these polluters are intended to be fined in order to disincentives them from polluting,” Seamans said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/TX_Dallas_Cloudy_TonyGutierrez_AP-609656536330,N,,2025-06-15 23:01:43.246920

The landscape of electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. is on the brink of a significant shift. With the potential passing of a major bill that could strip away government incentives, many are left wondering: Can the EV market stand on its own? This question is more than just a political talking point; it’s a crucial consideration for consumers, manufacturers, and environmental advocates alike.

Understanding the Role of Government Incentives

For years, government incentives have played a pivotal role in boosting the adoption of electric vehicles. Tax credits, rebates, and grants have made EVs more accessible to the average consumer, helping to offset the higher upfront costs associated with these vehicles. According to a report from the International Energy Agency, the U.S. saw a significant increase in EV sales, with a 40% rise in 2021 alone, largely fueled by these incentives.

But what happens when these financial crutches are removed? The fear is that without government support, the momentum gained in the EV market could stall. Manufacturers might find it challenging to maintain production levels, and consumers could hesitate to make the switch to electric, especially if prices rise.

The Consumer Perspective: Will They Still Buy EVs?

Imagine you’re in the market for a new car. You’ve done your research, and you’re leaning toward an electric vehicle because of its environmental benefits and lower operating costs. Now, picture that the tax credit you were counting on is no longer available. Would you still make the purchase? For many consumers, the answer might be no.

A survey conducted by the Consumer Reports found that nearly 60% of potential EV buyers cited financial incentives as a significant factor in their decision-making process. Without these incentives, the perceived value of EVs diminishes, and consumers may opt for traditional gasoline vehicles, which could lead to a slowdown in the transition to cleaner energy.

Manufacturers: Adapting to a New Reality

Automakers are already navigating a challenging landscape. The shift toward electric vehicles requires substantial investment in technology and infrastructure. Companies like Tesla, Ford, and General Motors have committed billions to EV development, but the removal of government support could force them to reevaluate their strategies.

For instance, Ford has announced ambitious plans to ramp up EV production, aiming to produce over 2 million electric vehicles annually by 2026. However, if consumer demand falters due to the lack of incentives, these plans could be jeopardized. Manufacturers might need to pivot their focus, perhaps investing more in hybrid technologies or even scaling back production altogether.

Environmental Implications: A Step Backward?

The potential decline in EV adoption due to the removal of incentives doesn’t just impact the automotive industry; it has broader implications for the environment. The U.S. has set ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and electric vehicles are a cornerstone of these efforts.

If fewer consumers are buying EVs, the country could see a slowdown in its progress toward these environmental targets. A study from the Union of Concerned Scientists highlights that widespread adoption of electric vehicles could reduce emissions significantly, but this progress is contingent on maintaining consumer interest and support.

Looking Ahead: What’s Next for the EV Market?

As the bill progresses through the legislative process, stakeholders are watching closely. The outcome could reshape the future of transportation in the U.S. If the bill passes, it may force the industry to innovate in ways we haven’t yet imagined. Manufacturers might need to find new ways to make EVs appealing without government incentives, perhaps through advancements in battery technology or enhanced features that justify the cost.

The big takeaway? The future of the EV market isn’t just about the vehicles themselves; it’s about how we navigate the challenges ahead. Whether through innovative marketing strategies or new financing options, the industry will need to adapt. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/will-the-ev-market-thrive-without-government-support.avif,N,,2025-06-16 02:00:21.943699

Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can lower our carbon footprint. Many nations strive to meet international climate targets, and that’s why shifting to renewable energy will achieve that much-needed long-term sustainability.

The transition is a necessary evolution of how societies produce and consume energy. Once we have a better knowledge of the role of renewable energy, we can better appreciate its impact on our collective climate goals. Without any further ado, let’s look into it.

Learn More about the Climate Crisis

The climate crisis we face today comes from human activities and natural processes. Scientific consensus shows that human-induced factors, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are at the core of rising global temperatures. Hurricanes, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather patterns are all consequences of this temperature rise.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avert catastrophic effects. Achieving this ambitious target requires immediate action, and we can all start by shifting from using fossil fuels to cleaner energy solutions. A higher awareness of the intricacies of the climate crisis can motivate communities and leaders to embrace renewable energy as a pathway to environmental recovery.

Energy Education and Awareness

Educating communities about renewable energy can be a good starting point in creating a sustainable future. Looking for the right renewable energy education in the form of university degrees, courses, or certifications can empower younger generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to address climate challenges. By teaching students about the benefits of clean energy and its impact on the environment, we cultivate a society that values sustainability.

Community workshops can engage diverse populations and improve their understanding of renewable technologies. Local governments and organizations can partner to hold initiatives that promote the adoption of solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. An increased public image will turn into higher acceptance of renewable energy solutions and facilitate a cultural shift toward sustainability.

Why is Renewable Energy A Viable Alternative?

Renewable energy offers a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during operation. Solar energy harnesses sunlight through photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into power.

These innovations combat climate change and promote energy independence, reducing reliance on foreign oil. Investments in renewable energy can stimulate economic growth and create more jobs in the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance sectors. The potential for efficient energy generation through renewable sources will only continue to expand.

The bill allows county commissioners, municipal corporations, or townships to adopt legislation requesting that the director of the Ohio Department of Development “designate the site of a brownfield or former coal mine within the subdivision’s territory as a priority investment area.” When considering the designation of a priority investment area (PIA), the director of the Ohio Department of Development is required to “prioritize the designation of areas negatively impacted by the decline the coal industry.”

Under the law, the property becomes a PIA when the Director of Development notifies the local legislative authority, or within 90 days if no notification is sent. Once designated as a priority investment area (PIA), a property will be exempt from taxation for five years, which encourages public utilities to use the property for energy development. The law also requires the Power Siting Board to adopt rules for the accelerated review of energy projects located in an approved PIA.

Agricultural commodity groups like Ohio Corn & Wheat, as well as environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy, have praised the bill, noting that generating power on brownfields and former coal mines will have the added benefit of protecting farmland and native habitats. The thinking is that with more PIAs available for energy generation and accelerated approval from the Power Siting Board of PIAs, the need to use farmland and other areas for renewable energy projects would diminish. Instead, under the new law, political subdivisions and energy generators would be incentivized to use brownfield and former coal mine land that has already been developed, helping Ohio to both protect farmland and meet the demand for more energy generation.

H.B. 15 will go into effect on August 14, 2025. The bill is available in its entirety here.",https://www.morningagclips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Statehouse-exterior.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 19:02:04.979472

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal.
“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth.
""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats.

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal. Nineteen of them responded, all saying that the proposal was scientifically wrong and many of them called it disinformation. Here's what eight of them said.

“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth. “The relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperatures has been well established since the late 1800s, and coal burning is the single biggest driver of global CO2 emissions, followed by oil and gas. It is utterly nonsensical to say that carbon emissions from power plants do not contribute significantly to climate change.”

""It’s about as valid as saying that arsenic is not a dangerous substance to consume,"" said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.

""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats. These are indisputable facts,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and a retired public health professor at the University of Washington.

Climate economist R. Daniel Bressler of Columbia University, said: “We can use tools from climate economics, including the mortality cost of carbon and the social cost of carbon, to estimate the climate impacts of these emissions. For instance, in my past work, I found that adding just one year’s worth of emissions from an average-sized coal-fired plant in the U.S. causes 904 expected temperature-related deaths and over $1 billion in total climate damages.”

University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs said: ""Their statement is in direct conflict with evidence that has been presented by thousands of scientists from almost 200 countries for decades.

“It’s basic chemistry that burning coal and natural gas releases carbon dioxide and it’s basic physics that CO2 warms the planet. We’ve known these simple facts since the mid-19th century,” said Oregon State's Phil Mote.

Andrew Weaver, a professor at the University of Victoria and former member of parliament in British Columbia, said: “President Trump is setting himself up for international court charges against him for crimes against humanity. To proclaim you don’t want to deal with climate change is one thing, but denying the basic science can only be taken as a wanton betrayal of future generations for which there should be consequences.”

Stanford climate scientist Chris Field, who coordinated an international report linking climate change to increasingly deadly extreme weather, summed it up this way: ""It is hard to imagine a decision dumber than putting the short-term interests of oil and gas companies ahead of the long-term inters of our children and grandchildren.""

The proposed rule, issued June 13, 2025, lays out several regulatory changes to help strengthen implementation of the RFS program.
Specifically, the agency explained foreign biofuels and feedstocks are only being provided 50% of the value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.
“The RFS supports these communities through steady income generated from converting their waste to renewable fuel.
“In addition to increasing the volumes to match actual production, EPA has several opportunities to increase the demand for more domestic, renewable fuels.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced its proposed required volumes and percentage standards under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2026 and 2027. The agency also partially waived the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and revised the associated percentage standard due to a shortfall in cellulosic biofuel production.

The proposed rule, issued June 13, 2025, lays out several regulatory changes to help strengthen implementation of the RFS program. In a move designed to promote more use of domestically produced biofuels and strengthen U.S. energy security, the proposal reduces the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) generated for imported renewable fuels as well as imported feedstocks used to produce renewable fuels.

It additionally removes renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS program (eRINs), which is in line with President Donald Trump’s goal of eliminating the electric vehicle mandate, according to the announcement.

The agency set the following proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs):

If finalized, these would be the highest volume requirements ever under the RFS program, according to EPA.

Historically, the RFS had just one “dial” in which the volumes could only go up or down, but EPA is proposing a second dial that would change the value of a RIN based whether the biofuel is from domestic or foreign sources. Specifically, the agency explained foreign biofuels and feedstocks are only being provided 50% of the value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

The proposed rule reduces reliance on foreign sources of oil by roughly 150,000 barrels of oil per day over the time frame of the “Set 2” rule, which includes 2026 and 2027. Additionally, in 2024, about 45% of biomass-based diesel (BBD) feedstock and finished fuel came from foreign sources. By reducing the value of the RIN for foreign biofuels and feedstocks, it will decrease America’s reliance on these imports, promote U.S. production and increase American energy security, EPA's statement explained.

“We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said of the changes affecting imports.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins added, “President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. This move by Administrator Zeldin is the boldest proposal ever and will provide certainty in a much-needed market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. ... This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation, and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world.”

Rollins gave the example of the administration’s recent deal with the U.K. securing zero-tariff access for over $700 million in ethanol exports.

The corn and soybean industries – primary commodities for producing renewable fuels – are grateful to the administration for the significant boost to biofuel volumes.

In addition, the North American Renderers Association (NARA) applauded the higher RVO targets, saying they represent a strong commitment to advancing clean energy while supporting the U.S. agriculture and rendering industries.

Rendered animal fats and other recycled byproducts processed by NARA members are vital feedstocks for the production of biodiesel and renewable diesel that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a circular economy by turning waste into valuable, low-carbon energy, the organization said.

“This substantial increase in the RVO provides long-term certainty for producers,” said Kent Swisher, president and chief executive officer of NARA, adding, “The rendering industry is proud to be part of the solution.”

Not everyone is thrilled with the changes. The American Biogas Council (ABC), the voice of the U.S. biogas industry, expressed disappointment with the reductions to the cellulosic ethanol RVOs under the Set 2 rule. ABC executive director Patrick Serfass said in a statement the cellulosic proposal “cuts growth in half, two years in a row, down to 5% annual growth, ignoring the demonstrated 20-30% growth of D3 fuel production.

“This proposal is not a win for all farmers. In particular, dairy and other livestock farmers are the most harmed,” he added. “The RFS supports these communities through steady income generated from converting their waste to renewable fuel. This misalignment is particularly surprising given the Administration’s welcome, outspoken support for American farmers and the natural gas industry.

“In addition to increasing the volumes to match actual production, EPA has several opportunities to increase the demand for more domestic, renewable fuels. We implore EPA to take action on outstanding pathways and tailpipe rules to help grow end-use markets,” Serfass said.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blte5a51c2d28bbcc9c/blt7b041692437e0673/684f31cc054857226546a34c/biofuel_tanker_truck_-Getty_Images.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-15 18:03:40.883367

We're wrapping up Climate Solutions Week here at NPR. This year's theme is Rethinking Home. And all week, we've looked at ways our homes and communities can be more resilient and offer solutions to the changing climate. And for the week's finale here on WEEKEND EDITION, we have NPR's climate solutions correspondent, Julia Simon.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: Hello, Ayesha. Today, I want to take you to a place that's working to combat climate change through their housing. That place is Vienna.

RASCOE: Vienna, Austria? You're not talking about, like, Vienna, Virginia.

(LAUGHTER)

SIMON: No.

RASCOE: OK.

SIMON: Vienna, Austria.

RASCOE: OK. OK.

(SOUNDBITE OF CHILDREN PLAYING)

SIMON: A few months ago, I traveled to the Austrian capital.

My hat just flew off 'cause it's very windy.

In this big, grassy park with playgrounds full of kids. There's a bunch of apartment buildings around this park, but one stands out. It's a modern building. It's got lots of wood, lots of windows. On one of the top floors, I see a guy in a beanie waving. This is Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN SCHUBLACH: Schublach, if you need the full name.

SIMON: Yes.

Schublach works at a think tank. He's lived in this modern building for about six years with his wife and two young daughters. He takes us on a tour. Shall we go upstairs?

SCHUBLACH: Yes, we can go upstairs.

SIMON: Yes. Let's do it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ELEVATOR BEEPING)

SIMON: It's six floors, lots of shared amenities.

Nice sauna.

SCHUBLACH: Yeah, nice view.

SIMON: With a view, yeah.

And, Ayesha, there are a lot of climate-friendly aspects - things that help the building reduce planet-heating pollution. There are solar panels.

SCHUBLACH: They're on the rooftop.

SIMON: Oh...

SCHUBLACH: Over there, you can...

SIMON: ...Just over there.

SCHUBLACH: Yeah.

SIMON: There are cool window shades on the outside of the apartment that help keep out the sunlight and the heat in summer.

SCHUBLACH: Yes.

SIMON: Do you mind showing us?

(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SCRAPING OPEN)

RASCOE: This all sounds really nice. But, I mean, he must be paying a lot for this.

SIMON: Well, for a four-bedroom, utilities included, plus the shared space, he pays about $1,700 a month.

SCHUBLACH: Which is not cheap-cheap, but it is definitely affordable.

SIMON: Oh, God. You don't want to know what people are paying in America (laughter).

SCHUBLACH: No, I don't want to.

(LAUGHTER)

SIMON: Ayesha, the whole reason we came to Vienna is because this climate-friendly apartment - it's not some fancy private apartment. It's actually subsidized by Vienna's city government. It's something called social housing. It got going a hundred years ago, after World War I. There was a housing crisis, and the city built thousands of apartments. So there's city-built housing, and there's social housing that Schublach lives in. It's city-subsidized housing - housing developers get loans and land from the city. Altogether, there's over 400,000 social housing units around Vienna, and about half the city's residents live in them - about a million people.

RASCOE: That's a lot.

SIMON: It is a lot. And in recent years, city leaders realized that those 400,000-plus apartment units that they own or subsidize - that could help them move off fossil fuels and reach their climate goals.

RASCOE: So how are they doing that?

SIMON: Well, let's start with the city-built housing. With the new city-built housing, it's all mandated to have solar panels. Many have efficient heat pumps. The city is also heating buildings with something called geothermal energy. That involves drilling into the earth to heat homes. And the city is retrofitting old buildings. They're putting in new windows, doors, insulation.

RASCOE: But what about the city-subsidized housing? Like, how do they get that to be climate-friendly?

SIMON: For city-subsidized housing, the city says, you housing developers - you want this land and subsidies? You got to compete for it. There's a point system for how many nice qualities the building design has. If the project has more climate-friendly aspects, the developer gets more points to win.

RASCOE: So that's a lot of motivation for developers to make a climate-friendly design.

SIMON: Right. There's land on the line and money on the line. And this right here - this housing competition - researchers say it's key to a lot of Vienna's innovation in climate-friendly housing. Social housing is popular in Vienna, and people around the world are noticing.

JUNG YOON: I have been absolutely inspired by Vienna's work.

SIMON: This is Jung Yoon.

YOON: I'm the chief of policy for the mayor's office in Chicago.

SIMON: Yoon went to Vienna last April to learn about Vienna's social housing. And there were lots of representatives from other U.S. cities on her trip.

YOON: From Nashville, from Seattle, from Philly.

SIMON: She went to Schublach's place.

YOON: Yes, we went there. It was beautiful.

SIMON: Yoon brought back lessons from Vienna to add to the work Chicago was already doing. This spring, the city of Chicago passed an ordinance that basically will help allow the city to develop and own new apartment buildings. 30% of the apartments will be affordable. And it will have regulations that reduce the energy use. And, like Vienna, Chicago sees housing as a key way to reduce their climate pollution. Yoon says more than two-thirds of Chicago's greenhouse gases come from buildings. We're in a moment where, on the federal level, the government is backtracking on climate action and proposing big cuts to public housing. But on the local level, there already are examples of green social housing popping up, Ayesha. There's a affordable housing building in Seattle with solar panels and energy-efficient air conditioning. There's an affordable housing building in Yonkers, New York. It has really high energy efficiency standards.

SIMON: I spoke to politicians across the country who are supporting efforts to build new apartments that are both affordable and climate-friendly. And, look, Ayesha - there will still be people in the U.S. who want their house in the suburbs. Schublach in Vienna - he grew up in the Austrian countryside, which he says is like America in that way.

SCHUBLACH: I think it's very similar to the American dream of owning a single-family house in the countryside. Yes. And the downside is that this dream, for most people, has become unaffordable. Some say it has become kind of a nightmare.

SIMON: But Schublach says he's found a new dream. In his green social housing, he's found a sense of community. In his apartment building, the oldest inhabitant is almost 80 years old, and the youngest is less than a month old. They're all there for each other.

SCHUBLACH: If somebody needs a banana at 8 p.m. because the kid would not eat anything else, then you get a banana within one minute.

SIMON: And the next time there's a storm or a heat wave - because there will be a next time - Schublach says he will be there for his neighbors, and they'll be there for him. Ayesha, you know, I keep returning to this one thing this climate researcher told me. She told me, in Vienna, a hundred years ago, they probably didn't imagine that now there would be thousands of beautiful, climate-friendly apartments. They started with one building - just one building. That was their North Star.

A spokesman for the Army Corps did not provide a comment Monday.
For over 20 years, banks in Hampton Roads have generated more than 75 acres of restored tidal wetlands, supporting local infrastructure projects while preserving critical ecological services.
The proposed shift to an “out-of-kind” mitigation site — replacing saltwater tidal wetlands with freshwater tidal systems — represents a stark departure from that approach.
“Wetlands Watch is opposed to the expansion of the bank’s reach into the Hampton Roads HUC, because the wetlands losses that we will expect to experience in Hampton Roads cannot be replaced through the creation of wetlands outside of our region,” she said.","RICHMOND — Hampton Roads environmental groups are alarmed over a proposed federal decision that they say could undermine decades of local tidal wetlands restoration and protection.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality are moving toward approval of a new wetland mitigation bank in Prince George County — 50 miles upstream from Hampton Roads — that would allow developers to purchase mitigation credits from outside the region.

Wetland mitigation banks are designed to compensate for environmental damage caused by permitted development projects. Developers buy credits from these banks to offset the impacts, typically by funding the creation or restoration of similar wetlands nearby.

The plan to outsource part of the process has prompted fierce opposition from conservationists, who warn that exporting these credits could lead to the continued loss of local saltwater tidal wetlands without restoring equivalent benefits in the region.

“This allows damages to local wetlands to still occur, but Hampton Roads will lose out on the extensive services and ecological benefits these wetland mitigation sites are designed to offset,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy, a Hampton Roads-based environmental group, said in a statement.

Helen Kuhns, the organization’s executive director, said in a phone interview that the proposed bank represents a dramatic break from long-established practices.

“In the past, the Army Corps has been very specific about the need for that mitigation to be done in the waterway, or at least in the life ecosystem that the damage is being done,” she said. “But the new bank that is proposed is in Prince George County, it’s 50 miles up the river. And the ecosystem there is not the same as it is here in Hampton Roads.”

Kuhns warned that credits purchased there would not deliver ecological benefits to impacted waterways like the Elizabeth River. “We would lose those ecosystem services,” she said.

A spokesman for the Army Corps did not provide a comment Monday.

For over 20 years, banks in Hampton Roads have generated more than 75 acres of restored tidal wetlands, supporting local infrastructure projects while preserving critical ecological services.

The proposed shift to an “out-of-kind” mitigation site — replacing saltwater tidal wetlands with freshwater tidal systems — represents a stark departure from that approach.

“The benefits of our local saltwater tidal wetlands are numerous and include coastal protection, erosion control, water quality improvement, aquatic species habitat and nurseries, carbon sequestration, and environmental contaminant remediation,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy stated.

Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of Wetlands Watch in Norfolk, called the shift deeply troubling.

“Wetlands Watch is opposed to the expansion of the bank’s reach into the Hampton Roads HUC, because the wetlands losses that we will expect to experience in Hampton Roads cannot be replaced through the creation of wetlands outside of our region,” she said.

Stiff noted that under the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) system — a national watershed classification system — trading mitigation credits across these distinct watershed boundaries compromises the integrity of local restoration.

“In coastal Virginia, our wetlands loss rates are staggering with the impacts of sea level rise,” Stiff added. “Wetlands growth rates can’t keep up with sea level rise rates, so our wetlands are drowning in place. And if we don’t do something about it, we’re projected to lose as much as 89% of tidal wetlands by 2080.”

Opponents also argue that freshwater wetlands in Prince George County cannot replicate those benefits. Coastal advocates further point to historical damage in areas like Norfolk — where the loss of wetlands has contributed to severe flooding — as evidence of why keeping restoration local is critical.

“Just considering exporting the flood storage capacity alone, Norfolk’s flood wall has a price tag of $2.7 billion,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy said.

Stiff emphasized the economic stakes as well.

“Wetlands provide countless ecosystem services, they are the most productive ecosystems in the world,” she said. From filtering pollutants and absorbing floodwaters to supporting fisheries and tourism, she noted, “without them, our fishing economy will tank, which provides a really important economic benefit to everyone in Virginia, not just in our region.”

The Corps has issued a notice of intent to approve the bank, despite objections from federal environmental agencies, local wetland experts, and grassroots groups across the region.

In response to the growing criticism, Irina Calos, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, clarified that the notice of intent came from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, not DEQ.

She noted that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and the Interagency Review Team (IRT) jointly oversee tidal wetland mitigation banks, with the Army Corps serving as the lead federal agency.

“The response from the Army Corps to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concludes that the bank complies with applicable laws and would provide the functions and services of tidal wetlands that would provide similar structure and function to the impacted tidal wetland,” Calos said. “As such, we would defer to VMRC and the Army Corps on tidal waters.”

Kuhns stressed that the state agency still plays a role in those decisions.

“The DEQ’s role in this is that they are part of the Interagency Review Team, and that is the committee that oversees restoration,” she said. “But I will say that the Army Corps does hold the highest influence there.”

According to Kuhns, the Corps originally helped establish the idea of local mitigation to ensure companies damaging tidal environments restored what they took away.

“We started understanding the important role that wetlands were playing, and why we needed to hold on to those,” she said. “The Army Corps had set up a program that when a company damages wetlands or river bottoms or oyster reefs in a construction capacity, then they have to mitigate for that damage within the watershed ecosystem that they are impacting.”

Stiff argued that the current plan violates that spirit.

“Everybody understands that in-kind replacement is the preferred option. And so breaking that trend is highly irregular,” she said. “The wetlands benefits that we’re deriving in our region are important to our region. And they’re more critically important to the property owners at the site where the damage is occurring.”

Coastal Virginia Conservancy warned that the precedent could set back progress made over the last two decades in restoring and protecting Hampton Roads’ unique coastal ecosystem.

“In the past, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has worked tirelessly to restore and make sure that damages were mitigated locally,” the group said in its statement. “The pending decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leaves Hampton Roads-based environmental groups greatly confused and concerned about the future of restoration in our local waters.”",https://images.wydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4525-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 23:59:00.752429

Small missteps or timeline delays along the way can cause investors to lose faith. That can restrict capital availability, often sending once-promising start-ups into financing free fall.

Lucid is still operating in this critical phase. It may want to roll out new mass-market models, but will need to raise a significant amount of cash in order to do so. It's not clear yet whether that will happen.

Rivian, meanwhile, is in a significantly better financial position. Its three upcoming mass-market vehicles -- the R2, R3, and R3X -- appear much further along in the development pipeline than Lucid's new models. Rivian confirmed last month that it is still on track to start production of the R2 in the first half of 2026 with a starting price of around $45,000. The R3 and R3X will follow sometime later.

While Lucid only has around $1.9 billion in cash, Rivian has nearly $4.7 billion on its books. Plus, over the past two quarters, Rivian has achieved positive gross margins, which Lucid has never managed. This all makes it much more likely that Rivian will successfully launch its first mass-market vehicles. And as Tesla has proven, that is perhaps the most important milestone an EV maker can achieve on its journey to unlock long-term growth.

So while Lucid is growing faster right now, Rivian looks like the better EV stock to own over the next few years and beyond.

""I have to make sure we don't use small businesses and residential customers as a financial backstop for Georgia Power.""","Elections for state and federal offices usually take place only in even years.

But this year, Georgia voters will head to the polls to fill two seats on the five-member state Public Service Commission, starting this Tuesday, June 17, with Republican and Democratic primaries.

Incumbent Republican Commissioner Tim Echols faces a challenger for the GOP nomination in PSC District 2, which includes eastern Georgia from Atlanta's eastern and southeastern suburbs to Savannah. Democratic Primary voters will decide which of three candidates takes on incumbent Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson in November in District 3, which covers the metro counties of Fulton, Clayton, and DeKalb.

The odd-year election stems from a 2022 lawsuit that challenged the way members of the PSC are elected. Four Black Fulton County residents and their lawyers argued that electing commissioners statewide instead of by district dilutes Black voting strength in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, making it harder for Black voters to elect a candidate of their choice.

A lower federal court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, but the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overturned that decision and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal. The ongoing case resulted in the postponement of both the 2022 and 2024 PSC elections.

District 2 Republicans

Lee Muns, a former member of the Columbia County Board of Education who ran unsuccessfully for the Columbia County Commission, is up against veteran Commissioner Tim Echols in District 2. It's unusual for an incumbent to draw a primary challenge, and Muns said he wouldn't run if he thought his opponent was doing a good job.

""We've seen the cost overruns at (nuclear Plant) Vogtle and the lack of looking forward to the future,"" Muns said. ""(Voters) are concerned about the oversight of the current commission.""

Muns has more than 35 years of experience in industrial construction, having founded multiple successful businesses. Before going into business on his own, he helped build Units 1 and 2 at Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle in the late 1980s.

""I'm a business owner,"" he said. ""I understand budgets. I understand supply-chain issues. ... I understand how much overhead you need to run an operation.""

If elected, Muns said he would push to freeze any Georgia Power rate increases until the PSC requires full transparency and accountability for Georgia Power and other utilities the commission regulates.

Georgia Power agreed last month to freeze customer rates for the next three years. But an agreement the company reached last month with the PSC's Public Interest Advocacy Staff nixed the next rate case Georgia Power had been due to file with the commission and the multiple rounds of public hearings that would have taken place.

Muns said the proposed rate freeze is a ""political ploy"" timed to coincide with this year's elections.

""It's trying to throw this out to voters and blind them,"" he said. ""Voters are smarter today than they used to be.""

Muns said he supports prohibiting Georgia Power from recovering from residential and small business customers the costs of supplying energy to the power-hungry data centers that are popping up across Georgia. Legislation that included such a requirement was introduced in the state Senate this year but failed to gain traction.

Echols said the PSC already has provided such a safeguard by approving a resolution last January forbidding Georgia Power from passing on the costs of serving new large-load customers - including data centers - to ratepayers.

""We have taken precautions to make sure large loads like data centers pay all incremental costs to generate and transmit their energy,"" he said. ""I feel good about the protections we have put in place for ratepayers.""

Echols, who grew up in Clayton County but lives in Hoschton near Athens, was elected to the PSC in 2010 and reelected in 2016. His term was supposed to be up in 2022 but was extended when the election was postponed.

After graduating from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree and two masters degrees, Echols started a Christian nonprofit educational ministry for teens. He also is an enthusiastic supporter of electric vehicles and has owned one for years.

Echols embraces the wave of data centers moving to Georgia as good for the state's economy.

""Georgia is poised to become the artificial intelligence capital of America - just like with fintech,"" he said. ""Data centers bring in seven-figure tax revenue for counties that land the projects - and that is attractive.""

Echols also supports the nuclear expansion at Plant Vogtle that was completed last year, seven years behind schedule with massive cost overruns. Vogtle's Units 3 and 4 were the first new nuclear reactors built in America in decades.

""Vogtle is an important milestone for Georgia Power and the entire state,"" he said. ""That said, to build more reactors we need some sort of financial backstop from the federal government.""

One thing Echols and Muns agree on is Georgia Power's decision to continue relying on coal and natural gas as part of the utility's portfolio of energy generation sources.

District 3 Democrats

The three Democrats seeking their party's nomination in PSC District 3 beg to differ.

""We are supposed to transition out of coal,"" said Robert Jones, a California native with a resume that includes working in software sales, as a technology executive, as a senior analyst at the California Public Utilities Commission, as an executive at Telecom Utility, and as a global business leader at Microsoft. ""All the environmental evidence says we should do it.""

""Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure will lock Georgia into decades of reliance on oil, coal, methane gas, further contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, which we've seen in all these storms throughout the country,"" added Keisha Sean Waites, a former member of the General Assembly and - more recently - the Atlanta City Council.

""You can't meet that 2050 no net-carbon goal (set by Georgia Power parent Southern Co.) and build new fossil fuel plants,"" said Peter Hubbard, a clean-energy advocate for a Georgia nonprofit. ""Renewables could power the grid reliably, but there's always been a headwind from the fossil fuels industry.""

Jones said he's the only candidate - or sitting commissioner - with the extensive utility management experience needed to assess the impact power-generating financing proposals from utilities would have on business and residential customers.

""My background of having worked in utility regulation is particularly relevant to the challenge Georgia voters face at this time,"" he said.

Waites brings extensive government experience to the race, having spent 15 years working for the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Waites is wary of the rapid growth of data centers in Georgia because of their impacts on both the environment and electric ratepayers.

""A data center uses the equivalent of a small town daily in water consumption and power,"" she said. ""I have to make sure we don't use small businesses and residential customers as a financial backstop for Georgia Power.""

Waites also suggested that the use of solar energy could be expanded if the PSC would increase the cap on its rooftop solar initiative from the current 5,000 homeowners.

Hubbard has testified as an expert witness before the commission during the last four rounds of hearings on Georgia Power requests for additional electrical generating capacity. He said the utility is asking for more capacity than it needs.

""You can't assume all these giant companies building data centers want to build them in Georgia,"" he said. ""(Georgia Power) is overestimating demand. ... They use these forecasts to justify new projects. But the load demand isn't there.""

The winner of the District 2 Republican primary between Echols and Muns will face Democrat Alicia Johnson in November, while the Democrat who wins the District 3 primary will take on GOP incumbent Fitz Johnson. Appointed to the PSC in 2021, this will be the first time Johnson has sought election to the post.

The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned.","Billionaire Elon Musk is fighting to make sure federal tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) -- a key subsidy that makes buying EVs more affordable -- remain in place. President Donald Trump's new bill seeks to eliminate these tax incentives, which would otherwise be in place until 2032.

Musk's company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has already seen sales struggle to grow across many key geographies. Deliveries last quarter fell by 32% quarter over quarter, and by 13% year over year. Could the elimination of EV tax credits be a lethal blow to the struggling automaker? You might be surprised by the answer.

Is Tesla struggling financially?

When it comes to potential regulation ""killing"" an operating business like Tesla, the first thing investors must consider is the effect on sales growth. Already, demand growth has been stagnating for Tesla. And while the company has teased new potential revenue sources like its robotaxi venture, there aren't many high-visibility milestones ahead that will meaningfully boost revenue over the next year or two. Analysts expect the company to refresh its existing lineup, but details are scarce on releasing any brand new models in 2025 or 2026. Even if a new model is released, it's unlikely that production will scale meaningfully over the next 12 to 24 months.

Is Tesla coming out with a new model soon?

Where does this leave Tesla over the near term? In the same position it is in today, attempting to stoke demand for an increasingly stale lineup. Making the company's vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive -- the range of federal incentives that Trump is proposing to eliminate -- could ultimately accelerate sales declines for Tesla. Any potential demand boost from releasing a more affordable Model Y or Model 3, meanwhile, could be completely offset by eliminated tax credits, resulting in minimal net savings for customers. In return, Tesla may need to compress its profit margins in order to keep demand growth on track.

Does Tesla have a lot cash on hand?

Fortunately, Tesla has the capital to withstand a multiyear stagnation in sales growth. It has $16 billion in cash and equivalents on the books, more than every other competitor. Its profit margins are also positive -- a rarity in the EV world -- meaning it can afford to cut profits a bit without going into the red. It should be mentioned, though, that Tesla has also relied on selling automotive regulator credits -- earned by selling carbon-free vehicles -- to maintain profitability. The company earned $595 million last quarter by selling these credits versus a net income of $409 million. But most of this ""free"" income from selling credits comes from states like California and New York, as well as incentive programs in the E.U., making them unlikely to be cut should U.S. federal incentives change.

Still, Tesla's biggest advantage is its $1 trillion market cap. Tesla could easily double the cash levels on its balance sheet while diluting shareholders by just 1% to 2%. This makes it very unlikely for the company to go under anytime soon. In fact, the elimination of EV tax credits could be a secret win for Tesla.

Eliminating EV tax credits could actually help Tesla

Many investors might be surprised to learn that ExxonMobil wishes for a carbon tax to be implemented. A carbon tax would make its output more expensive to buyers, potentially limiting demand. But if production costs rise, it's possible that many small competitors can't compete, leaving more of the market for well-capitalized behemoths like Exxon.

The same may prove true for Tesla. Most of its EV competition comes from unprofitable companies with minimal room for error like Rivian and Lucid Group. These EV makers are roughly 99% smaller than Tesla, with limited ability to tap the market for more capital at will. The elimination of EV tax credits would hurt them more than Tesla, potentially leaving more long-term market share for Musk and his investors.

Of course, the immediate effect will be negative for Tesla and the rest of the industry. But it should be stressed that bills are not laws. The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned. But the elimination of these subsidies certainly won't ""kill"" Tesla. In fact, there's an argument that it could be a long-term advantage due to lessened competition.

For NPR News, I'm Emily Russell in Long Lake, New York.","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

A tiny town in northern New York appears to have won the lottery. Long Lake is set to inherit more than $100 million from a local land deal. North Country Public Radio's Emily Russell reports on what the massive windfall means for the town.

EMILY RUSSELL, BYLINE: Clay Arsenault was on a Zoom call in late February when he got the news - Long Lake was named the sole beneficiary of the proceeds from a local property listed for $125 million.

CLAY ARSENAULT: I was speechless.

RUSSELL: Arsenault is the town's supervisor. The 36,000-acre property had been owned by the Whitneys for more than a century. They were one of the wealthiest families in America during the Gilded Age, and they were well-known benefactors in Long Lake. The property passed to the husband of one of the Whitneys, who bequeathed the proceeds of its sale to the town. A developer from Texas now plans to buy the land. So Arsenault is working with a team of officials and advisers on how to invest and maximize the proceeds from the sale.

ARSENAULT: We want to create generational wealth within the community. So it makes me truly excited for the future of my hometown.

RUSSELL: This town is home to about 700 people. There's a little grocery store, a gas station and a few other shops. From the edge of Long Lake, you can see the Adirondack Mountains rising above in the distance. This is a tourist town. It survives off the summer months, when second homeowners come to play and unwind - and to spend money.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING)

RUSSELL: Paula O'Brien-Piraino owns the Long Lake Diner with her husband. They're closed today, so she's perched at the bar with her planner out. She was at the town board meeting when the supervisor broke the news.

PAULA O'BRIEN-PIRAINO: It kind of felt like Christmas on steroids (laughter).

RUSSELL: It's unclear what the net proceeds of the property sale will be, but O'Brien-Piraino says she's hopeful the money could make a real difference in this small Adirondack town.

O'BRIEN-PIRAINO: We do live in the middle of paradise, but it is expensive to live here. A person moving to the Adirondack Park, fresh out of college, can't afford to build a home here.

RUSSELL: Land is expensive, and good-paying jobs here are hard to find. Long Lake faces other struggles, too, like declining school enrollment and an aging population. It's that last issue that resident Barbara Kinsey is focused on. Kinsey wants to see Long Lake invest in a community health and fitness center.

BARBARA KINSEY: When I think with my husband, should I settle here into my retirement? - I think, well, I have to go this so many miles to a hospital, this so many miles for therapy, this many (laughter) - like, you have to travel, travel, travel.

RUSSELL: But here's the thing - many folks who live in Long Lake love how quiet and remote it is. They like knowing their neighbors and seeing the same faces at the local bar. Some worry that tens of millions of dollars could change all that. Carol Young says those are real concerns. She manages one of the oldest businesses in town - the Adirondack Hotel.

CAROL YOUNG: I mean, one of the things that guests will say to me - oh, my gosh, I haven't been here in 35 years, and it's just exactly how I remember it. And I think that's important for small towns, especially - we're a tourist town.

RUSSELL: As we chat, her staff is preparing for the tourist season, putting a fresh coat of paint on the porch. The owners of the Whitney property came to the hotel from time to time. Young knew them and says while the news of their estate was wonderful, it wasn't exactly shocking.

YOUNG: It's what people like that do for things that they love, and they loved Long Lake. And so our responsibility is to make sure that that wish is guarded into perpetuity so that, as I like to put it as an accountant, the nut stays.

RUSSELL: It could be a year or more before Long Lake sees its potential $100 million nut. The years that follow will likely decide the fate of this small, soon-to-be wealthy town.

The move to repeal California’s EV mandate is a triumph for individual freedom and economic reality.
Preserving the right to choose among gas-powered vehicles, EVs and hybrids empowers consumers to make decisions based on their needs, budgets and lifestyles.","OPINION:

President Trump signed a congressional resolution Thursday to overturn a California regulation that would have allowed the state to mandate electric vehicles by 2035. Though the signing was followed almost immediately by a state lawsuit against the administration, it marked a huge win for American consumers, manufacturers and our economy.

By overturning these waivers, Congress and the president have reaffirmed the importance of consumer choice, economic freedom and practical energy policy. They are ensuring that Americans can continue to drive the vehicles that best suit their needs.

The waivers enabled California to mandate regulations that were stricter than federal regulations. While framed as an environmental necessity, they would in fact limit consumer options, inflate vehicle costs and strain fragile grids already short of electricity.

This repeal is celebrated as a big win for individual freedom, consumer choice and the rule of law, reflecting widespread sentiment that California’s policy overreached its authority and imposed a one-size-fits-all solution on our diverse nation.

The benefits of this repeal are many, starting with consumer choice. Not every American can afford or wants an electric vehicle. EVs remain expensive, with average prices significantly higher than gas-powered cars. For many families, especially in rural or suburban areas, gas-powered vehicles — particularly trucks and SUVs — remain the most practical and affordable option.

General Motors’ recently announced $888 million investment in a New York plant to produce next-generation V-8 engines is just one of many more benefits to come. Starting in 2027, this facility will manufacture powerful, efficient engines for trucks and SUVs, catering to consumers who rely on the vehicles for work, recreation and daily life.

This action ensures that Americans are not forced into EVs that do not suit their needs. Range anxiety, limited charging infrastructure and long charging times are barriers to EV adoption. This is particularly so for renters in regions with harsh winters or sparse charging networks. Forcing EVs on drivers risks the livelihoods of those who depend on the reliability and versatility of gas engines, especially in industries like construction, agriculture and trucking.

Moreover, the repeal prevents California’s mandate and the 11 states that followed it from having a ripple effect nationwide. As a major market, California’s regulations influence automakers’ production decisions, dictating vehicle choices across the country.

A forced shift to EVs could have disrupted supply chains and led to an increased reliance on foreign battery production. By preserving the production of gas-powered vehicles, Congress supports a balanced approach that maintains economic stability while allowing EV technology to mature naturally.

The repeal also addresses energy security. EVs rely on an electrical grid that is not yet equipped to manage a massive influx of demand, already strained by artificial intelligence demand and the premature closure of reliable coal and natural gas electricity generation. In California, where rolling blackouts have occurred, EVs mandates would increase the risk of more energy shortages.

Gas-powered vehicles, powered by domestically produced fuel, reduce dependence on volatile global battery supply chains, which are often controlled by communist Chinese manufacturers. This decision is a commonsense resolution that prevents price spikes and preserves energy stability and consumer choice.

Critics of the repeal argue that it undermines environmental progress, but this overlooks the reality that China produces more real pollution and carbon dioxide emissions than all other industrial nations combined. Adding to this, China and India are building hundreds of coal plants that last from 40 to 50 years. Mandating EVs would have little, if any, impact on the climate in the real world.

Automakers are already investing heavily in cleaner technologies, including more efficient gas engines and hybrids, which offer a practical bridge to the future. Forcing EVs on consumers prematurely risks backlash and economic disruption, as seen in the public’s resistance to the California mandate.

The move to repeal California’s EV mandate is a triumph for individual freedom and economic reality. Preserving the right to choose among gas-powered vehicles, EVs and hybrids empowers consumers to make decisions based on their needs, budgets and lifestyles. As the auto industry evolves, this repeal ensures that Americans remain in the driver’s seat, free to choose the vehicles of their choice at prices they can afford.

“A world powered by renewables is a world hungry for critical minerals,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said at a Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals held last year.
“For developing countries, critical minerals are a critical opportunity — to create jobs, diversify economies, and dramatically boost revenues.
There is also considerable concern that the countries that control the supply of critical minerals could hold a dangerous amount of leverage over global markets.
And this potential weak spot in global critical mineral supply chains has only been exacerbated by Trump-era tariffs and an overall bent toward nationalism and protectionism.","The clean energy revolution will depend on a steady supply of critical minerals to support the manufacturing of a wide range of technologies, from wind turbines to electric vehicle batteries. While not all of these ‘critical’ materials are rare, they are not naturally available everywhere in the world, leading to potential geopolitical minefields as competition over these supply chains heats up.

The United States Energy Act of 2020 provided an operational definition of ‘critical minerals’ as those that are:

essential to the economic or national security of the United States

have a supply chain vulnerable to disruption; and

serve an essential function in the manufacturing of a product integral to the economic or national security of the United States.

According to projections from the International Energy Agency, global demand for critical minerals from the clean energy industry will at least double, and possibly even quadruple, by 2040 depending on the world’s rate of clean energy adoption. That demand growth will primarily come from electric vehicles and battery storage. Lithium will see the fastest rate of growth, while graphite, copper and nickel will dominate overall demand when calculated by weight.

“A world powered by renewables is a world hungry for critical minerals,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said at a Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals held last year. “For developing countries, critical minerals are a critical opportunity — to create jobs, diversify economies, and dramatically boost revenues. But only if they are managed properly.”

While developing these materials can provide huge economic opportunities for emerging economies, extraction of these metals and minerals is also associated with significant environmental externalities. The production of lithium, for example, is incredibly water-intensive and can expose environments and communities to harmful and toxic chemicals. In a notable case from 2016, thousands of dead fish washed up seemingly overnight in a Tibetan river, which was poisoned by toxic chemicals from a nearby lithium extraction operation.

By definition, these minerals are also subject to key vulnerabilities and could be implicated by critical supply chain disruptions, with significant consequences for economies and national security, not just for the United States but for nations around the world. According to a recent Vox report, the uneven spread of critical minerals “could leave some countries bearing most of the environmental burdens from mining critical minerals while wealthier nations reap the economic benefits and other countries get left out of the supply chain entirely.” Moreover, spotty concentrations and uneven control over these critical supply chains creates key vulnerabilities in global clean energy markets if prices spike or collapse, or if emerging technologies increase scarcity.

There is also considerable concern that the countries that control the supply of critical minerals could hold a dangerous amount of leverage over global markets. China currently dominates the global market for a huge number of these materials. Beijing supplies about 85-95 percent of the world’s refined rare earth minerals – many of which are also critical minerals – and has dominated global markets for decades now thanks to a near-monopoly on rare earth refining capacities. China alone accounts for a whopping 85-90 percent of the world’s rare earth mine-to-metal refining. Chinese refineries supply 68 percent of the world’s cobalt, 65 percent of nickel, and 60 percent of EV-battery-grade lithium.

And China has shown in the past that it is not afraid to flex its might and disrupt global supply chains for its own political interest. And this potential weak spot in global critical mineral supply chains has only been exacerbated by Trump-era tariffs and an overall bent toward nationalism and protectionism.

As a result, we could see major upheaval and uncertainty in global clean energy markets, with far-ranging environmental and economic consequences. “If producers of these substances decide to restrict access to their customers as a political lever, if prices shoot up, or if more industries develop an appetite for them and eat into the supply,” Vox reports, “companies could go bankrupt and efforts to limit climate change could slow down.”

Today welcoming the 16th Environment Minister to serve throughout her tenure as Chair of the AKF, Tabart said a Koala Protection Act is the only legislative reform that stands a chance of saving Australia’s most beloved species. Yet, 15 consecutive Ministers have cowered to the stronghold of industry and refused to consider it as an option.

“A prerequisite for the position of Environment Minister has always been the ability to bury one’s head in the sand. 15 consecutive Ministers have ignored AKF’s science, refused to look at our world-leading habitat mapping, and in recent cases even denied a simple meeting,” Tabart said.

“Our democracy demands that our Ministers listen to the experts in their fields and face up to even the hardest of truths. So today, I ask the newly appointment Minister Watt to do what his predecessor refused to do - meet with me, talk about the science behind the plight of the Koala and implement real legislative reform to save it.”

Speaking today at the ICCB 2025, Tabart will make her plea to Minister Watt in front of the world’s best and brightest minds in the field of conservation biology. ICCB is a global forum for addressing conservation challenges and for presenting new research in conservation science and practice. It will be attended by over 1,500 conservation professionals and students from around the world.

In her address to the ICCB today, Tabart will also showcase AKF’s 30 year effort to map the entire geographical range of the Koala – spanning 1.5 million square kilometres across Australia. This world-leading science is a first-of-its-kind, yet offers no benefit in the hands of academics alone – it must be adopted by our political leaders and used as a catalyst to act.

“The Koala is the canary in the coal mine for the entire Australian ecosystem. If we can’t save the Koala, we can’t save anything. So, my question to Minister Watt is clear – will you be the reason the Koala survives, or the reason for its demise?”

The geographic range of the Koala covers 20% of Australia's stunning landscape, a habitat that also supports millions of other species, all of which could be preserved with a single signature from the new Environment Minister.

With Koalas now listed as Endangered in NSW, QLD and the ACT, AKF is calling on Minister Watt to enact a Koala Protection Act - a landmark piece of legislation that will enshrine the protection of Koala habitats and ensure a sustainable future for the species.

The long-rumored crossover known internally as the C6X will officially debut in 2026 as a 2027 model year vehicle, and rather than launching as a full electric, Chrysler is going hybrid first.

While many expected the century-old automaker to stick to its all-EV plan laid out a few years ago, that direction has changed. Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell made it clear that the brand is pivoting to embrace a “multi-energy” game plan that includes internal combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles—all underpinned by Stellantis’ STLA Large platform.

“In 2024, Stellantis began transitioning to its next generation of products that are designed to give customers the freedom of choice,” Feuell told MoparInsiders back in April. “Our new STLA multi-energy platforms, as well as our existing platforms, are engineered to offer a variety of powertrain options, including internal combustion, hybrid, and electric.”

This means the upcoming C6X, which is expected to be similar in size to the new Jeep® Wagoneer S, will go head-to-head with some of the most popular two-row crossovers on the market. The D-segment is the most crowded and competitive corner of the SUV market in the U.S., and Chrysler is making its long-overdue return to that arena with a hybrid-first approach.

Originally expected to arrive earlier, the C6X has been pushed back slightly to give the brand more time to get it right. Feuell confirmed in a recent interview with the Detroit Free Press that the vehicle will now launch as a 2027 model year and will be revealed sometime in 2025.

But beyond just launching a new product, Chrysler is aiming to reestablish its identity. The brand that brought Americans affordable luxury with style and innovation back in 1925 is returning to its roots. Feuell recently has been vocal about Chrysler leaning back into its “blue-collar luxury” image, offering premium features without the premium price.

That philosophy, once championed by founder Walter P. Chrysler, is being revived as Chrysler separates itself from Dodge’s muscle, Jeep’s off-road grit, FIAT’s urban mobility, and Ram’s workhorse image.

The upcoming C6X will carry that torch, likely packed with the latest tech (like Stellantis’ STLA AutoDrive, STLA Brain, and STLA SmartCockpit), upscale design cues, and hybrid efficiency, all aimed squarely at working families and professionals who want comfort, capability, and style without breaking the bank.

While Chrysler hasn’t ruled out a fully electric version of the C6X in the future, starting with a hybrid just makes sense. It keeps the price in check, appeals to a broader market, and gives the brand some breathing room to grow its EV offerings down the line.

Green Allies – Althouse Arboretum

The Althouse Arboretum is a student led outdoor education center. In 2024, it saw over 17,000 visitors who engaged with programming led exclusively by a team of high school students from five surrounding school districts. Students were responsible for everything, including writing curriculum for a summer nature camp program and hosting community events. In 2024, the organization secured a property nearby its existing arboretum, which provided a grass meadow they deemed essential to expanding programming. The arboretum constructed a trail built entirely by volunteers to connect the new land to the existing property. On the lands of the Althouse Arboretum, students have planted over 100 native PA trees, along with introducing over 50 varieties of native wildflowers and other plants onto the property and into their natural habitats. The Arboretum ran a variety of sustainability programs in 2024, including a community recycling day, which resulted in a collection of 21 tons of electronics, appliances, and scrap metal from the 426 vehicles that participated. Students also collected 78 bicycles, which were then refurbished and donated to underserved families.

East Hempfield Township – Amos Herr Wetland Restoration

The Amos Herr Wetland Restoration project converted over six acres of unused land into an ecosystem of trails, meadows, and wetlands, allowing for a sustainable and multi-purpose area that serves the communities’ needs while also promoting biodiversity. The topography of the resulting wetland habitat naturally provides storage volume for nuisance storms, reducing flooding risks and promoting natural water retention. The project led to the reduction of 98,015 pounds of sediment and 2,369 pounds of nitrogen, contributing to enhanced water quality and ecosystem health. And 75 trees were planted throughout the wetlands, increasing biodiversity and providing habitats for wildlife.

The projectengages students through in-school lessons about microplastics, concluding with a field trip to their local watershed where students conduct a microplastics survey. The survey is conducted through a low-cost microplastics trawl, which students deploy behind a paddleboard. This program led 245 young people to community-engaged citizen-based science and allows for the monitoring of microplastics pollutions at seven sites across western Pennsylvania. Through these practices, Aqua Lab Adventures fosters young leaders in environmental conservation by exposing them to a side of the environment they never would have been familiar with had this program not existed.

Discovery Pathways – Youth Environmental Leaders Program

The Discovery Pathways: Youth Environmental Leaders Program’s goals are to create free and multilingual outdoor experiences for underrepresented youth and families in the Southeast Philadelphia area, primarily immigrant and refugee communities. The Youth Environmental Leadership Program seeks to train BIPOC, immigrant, and refugee youth in leadership, public speaking, water testing, kayaking, fishing, and sustainability. In 2024, 31 high-need students were selected for this program. Discovery Pathways hosted 21 large community boating events reaching 12,011 participants, conducted weekly water tests where data was shared with government officials and local communities, removed 11,000 pounds of trash, educated 2,000 children in hands-on environmental education, and marked over 75 storm drains, and led anti-litter campaigns in several languages.

UpstreamPgh – Dornbust Street Green Stormwater Infrastructure Project

The Dornbush Street Green Stormwater Infrastructure Project converted two vacant parcels of land on a residential street into a series of rain gardens with subsurface storage and an ADA accessible pathway. The rain gardens receive stormwater from green inlets on Dornbush Street, which is the second steepest street in Pittsburgh and eighth steepest in the United States. The project is estimated to capture an estimated 1.6 million gallons of stormwater each year. While helping to manage stormwaters, the project also included the planting of many native flower shrubs and tree species including Mountain Laurel.

Schuylkill Haven Area High School Biology Club – Empowering Environmental Stewardship

The Empowering Environmental Stewardship program is run through a high school biology club meant to provide students with opportunities to engage in environmental activities. Activities include a twice-yearly highway litter clean-up, tree planting along Bear Creek, and raising trout species from eggs to fingerling. To raise trout, the club transformed a 55-gallon aquarium into a mini-Coldwater ecosystem. The trout raised in sheltered conditions have a significantly higher hatch rate, with 162 of 199 eggs becoming fingerlings, compared to a one to two percent survival rate in nature.

ESG goals are now tied to investor confidence, brand reputation, and even talent attraction. Yet despite the influx of corporate pledges, a significant number of sustainability projects either stall or fail outright.

Why? It's rarely a lack of ambition. More often, the breakdown happens in execution—where the people funding, building, and operating these systems aren't aligned, and the promised results never materialize.

Building a Passive Talent Strategy from the Ground Up

How can entrepreneurs effectively identify, engage, and recruit high-caliber individuals who aren't actively job hunting? It starts with recognizing that traditional pipelines don't reach these candidates—and neither do generic outreach messages or vague promises of ""impact.""

To win the attention of high-level talent, founders must learn to think like headhunters: zeroing in on logic-based career progression, delivering personalized value, and crafting opportunities that align with both professional aspirations and life priorities.

1. Misalignment—not ambition—is what kills most sustainability initiatives

Most sustainability efforts don't fail because of a lack of will—they fail because the people funding, designing, and operating them aren't aligned. When sustainability is siloed from core business units like finance or operations, it becomes a disconnected initiative rather than a strategic driver. Without shared accountability and cross-functional buy-in, even well-intentioned projects stall or lose momentum. Real progress starts when sustainability goals are embedded across governance, metrics, and decision-making frameworks—not just tacked on as an afterthought.

2. Energy-as-a-Service shifts risk and accountability to the provider

One of the biggest hurdles to effective energy transformation is the complexity of aligning technical upgrades, financing, and long-term performance tracking. That's why more organizations are turning to Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) models like ENFRA's, which bundle engineering, capital, and measurement into a single, performance-backed solution.

As David Krauss, EVP at ENFRA, explains, ""We capitalize the improvements, guarantee performance, and stay involved for the long haul. With our model, customers don't have to shoulder the entire risk—or hope savings projections hold up years later.""

ENFRA's use of daily savings reports, machine learning fault detection, and ongoing co-management with facility staff helps ensure results don't just appear after installation—they persist and improve over time. This approach has helped clients like Midland Health realize over 120% of their guaranteed savings, with no debt added to their balance sheet.

3. Short-term upgrades won't solve a long-term problem

Too many sustainability efforts focus on individual products or technologies without considering their full lifecycle impact. This fragmented thinking leads to short-term wins that often shift risk elsewhere in the system—socially, environmentally, or financially. Real sustainability demands a systems-level mindset: one that rewards long-term outcomes over isolated metrics. Instead of treating sustainability as a checklist or compliance task, organizations must rethink it as a strategy for balance—across climate, communities, and capital. That shift begins by replacing reactive fixes with outcome-driven partnerships built for resilience and scale.

Rethinking Risk, Reclaiming Results

In a climate-conscious business environment, sustainability isn't optional—but neither is failure. Leaders must ask not just what they're doing, but how and with whom they're doing it.

Energy-as-a-Service offers a viable path forward: one that balances financial certainty, environmental responsibility, and operational ease. It's time for a new approach—because doing sustainability differently is the only way to finally do it right.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68406324e83c814854941216/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-15 16:06:10.164291

“This is a violation of long-standing precedent and a direct assault on our authority to lead on clean air,” said Mr. Newsom.

In the broader context of U.S. climate policy, the legal battle underscores the growing tension between federal and state authority over environmental regulation.","California filed suit Friday against the federal government in a legal clash over state authority and environmental regulation, challenging what officials described as an unprecedented attempt by Congress to block California’s stringent vehicle emissions standards.

The lawsuit, led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta and joined by Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Air Resources Board, contests the use of the Congressional Review Act to nullify waivers previously granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. These waivers, long considered foundational to California’s environmental leadership, allow the state to set stricter vehicle emissions rules than federal standards.

Filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals, the lawsuit was joined by 10 other states, including New York, Massachusetts, and Washington, forming a broad coalition in defense of California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Omnibus, and Advanced Clean Trucks programs.

“This is about California’s right to protect the health of its residents,” said Mr. Bonta in a statement. “The federal government’s effort to revoke these waivers is not only unlawful, it is reckless—placing both our clean air goals and green economy at risk.”

At the heart of the legal dispute is a series of EPA waivers issued since 2023, which enabled California to implement more aggressive standards for passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks, mandating increasing sales of zero-emission vehicles and tightening pollution thresholds for internal combustion engines. These rules are central to California’s efforts to combat air pollution and climate change. State officials argue that if the regulations are invalidated, California could lose an estimated $45 billion in avoidable health care costs over time.

The lawsuit accuses the Trump-era EPA of overstepping legal norms by transmitting the waivers to Congress as if they were federal rules, thereby inviting disapproval votes under the Congressional Review Act—a 1996 law intended to allow Congress to overturn federal regulations. But historically, the CRA has not been used to reverse agency waivers, which are considered adjudicatory decisions rather than rulemaking. Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian have previously concluded that the CRA does not apply to EPA waivers of this kind.

“This is a violation of long-standing precedent and a direct assault on our authority to lead on clean air,” said Mr. Newsom. “It’s a move straight out of the polluters’ playbook, and we will not let it stand.”

The EPA, under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, has granted California more than 75 waivers since the 1970s, recognizing the state’s unique air quality challenges and longstanding emissions control programs, which predate federal clean air legislation.

Environmental groups and public health advocates have raised alarms over the potential rollback. California remains home to several of the most polluted air basins in the country, and transportation remains the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. In California, more than 2 million zero-emission vehicles have already been sold, and state officials say the clean vehicle market is accelerating faster than expected.

The regulations at stake include the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires that by 2035, 80 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in the state must be fully electric, with the remainder allowed to be plug-in hybrids. The Advanced Clean Trucks rule mandates the sale of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks, while the Omnibus rule imposes stricter limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines.

The lawsuit argues that the disapproval resolutions passed by Congress are not only procedurally flawed but also violate the Constitution’s principles of federalism and separation of powers. It asks the court to invalidate the resolutions and order the federal government to honor the waivers as granted.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment on pending litigation.

In the broader context of U.S. climate policy, the legal battle underscores the growing tension between federal and state authority over environmental regulation. With the Biden administration walking a fine line between its own climate ambitions and a divided Congress, California’s challenge sets up another high-stakes confrontation over who decides how clean American cars should be.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-06-15 15:01:10.451208

For NPR News, I'm Emily Russell in Long Lake, New York.","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

A tiny town in northern New York appears to have won the lottery. Long Lake is set to inherit more than $100 million from a local land deal. North Country Public Radio's Emily Russell reports on what the massive windfall means for the town.

EMILY RUSSELL, BYLINE: Clay Arsenault was on a Zoom call in late February when he got the news - Long Lake was named the sole beneficiary of the proceeds from a local property listed for $125 million.

CLAY ARSENAULT: I was speechless.

RUSSELL: Arsenault is the town's supervisor. The 36,000-acre property had been owned by the Whitneys for more than a century. They were one of the wealthiest families in America during the Gilded Age, and they were well-known benefactors in Long Lake. The property passed to the husband of one of the Whitneys, who bequeathed the proceeds of its sale to the town. A developer from Texas now plans to buy the land. So Arsenault is working with a team of officials and advisers on how to invest and maximize the proceeds from the sale.

ARSENAULT: We want to create generational wealth within the community. So it makes me truly excited for the future of my hometown.

RUSSELL: This town is home to about 700 people. There's a little grocery store, a gas station and a few other shops. From the edge of Long Lake, you can see the Adirondack Mountains rising above in the distance. This is a tourist town. It survives off the summer months, when second homeowners come to play and unwind - and to spend money.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING)

RUSSELL: Paula O'Brien-Piraino owns the Long Lake Diner with her husband. They're closed today, so she's perched at the bar with her planner out. She was at the town board meeting when the supervisor broke the news.

PAULA O'BRIEN-PIRAINO: It kind of felt like Christmas on steroids (laughter).

RUSSELL: It's unclear what the net proceeds of the property sale will be, but O'Brien-Piraino says she's hopeful the money could make a real difference in this small Adirondack town.

O'BRIEN-PIRAINO: We do live in the middle of paradise, but it is expensive to live here. A person moving to the Adirondack Park, fresh out of college, can't afford to build a home here.

RUSSELL: Land is expensive, and good-paying jobs here are hard to find. Long Lake faces other struggles, too, like declining school enrollment and an aging population. It's that last issue that resident Barbara Kinsey is focused on. Kinsey wants to see Long Lake invest in a community health and fitness center.

BARBARA KINSEY: When I think with my husband, should I settle here into my retirement? - I think, well, I have to go this so many miles to a hospital, this so many miles for therapy, this many (laughter) - like, you have to travel, travel, travel.

RUSSELL: But here's the thing - many folks who live in Long Lake love how quiet and remote it is. They like knowing their neighbors and seeing the same faces at the local bar. Some worry that tens of millions of dollars could change all that. Carol Young says those are real concerns. She manages one of the oldest businesses in town - the Adirondack Hotel.

CAROL YOUNG: I mean, one of the things that guests will say to me - oh, my gosh, I haven't been here in 35 years, and it's just exactly how I remember it. And I think that's important for small towns, especially - we're a tourist town.

RUSSELL: As we chat, her staff is preparing for the tourist season, putting a fresh coat of paint on the porch. The owners of the Whitney property came to the hotel from time to time. Young knew them and says while the news of their estate was wonderful, it wasn't exactly shocking.

YOUNG: It's what people like that do for things that they love, and they loved Long Lake. And so our responsibility is to make sure that that wish is guarded into perpetuity so that, as I like to put it as an accountant, the nut stays.

RUSSELL: It could be a year or more before Long Lake sees its potential $100 million nut. The years that follow will likely decide the fate of this small, soon-to-be wealthy town.

The new subsidiary, Tesla Morocco, was registered on May 27, 2025, with a starting capital of MAD 27.5 million (approximately USD 2.75 million).

Located in the high-end Crystal Tower at Casablanca Marina, the office signals Tesla’s long-term commitment to Morocco as a regional base and a gateway into Africa.

Tesla Morocco will oversee vehicle importation, sales, servicing, and charging infrastructure. It will also distribute clean-energy products like solar panels, battery storage, and energy network services.

Prior to this launch, Tesla had already set up hybrid superchargers in Casablanca and Tangier in 2021. The network later expanded to Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, and Agadir.

Tesla not interested in manufacturing in India, Minister confirms

“With an expanding renewable energy sector, an established car manufacturing industry, and progressive investment policies, Morocco offers Tesla a strong foundation for long-term growth,” the company said.

The office will also provide technical support, after-sales services, and staff training. This highlights Tesla’s goal of delivering a fully integrated, locally tailored ecosystem.

The subsidiary is co-managed by Rafael Arqueza Martin and Shahin Oliver Khorshidpanah. It is backed by Tesla International B.V. and Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V.

The leadership structure reflects Tesla’s strategy of combining global expertise with local efficiency.

Tesla’s choice of Morocco aligns with the country’s rise as a clean-energy and automotive hub. It also supports Morocco’s goal to become carbon-neutral and grow its tech sector.

In April 2025, Tesla Chairman Elon Musk confirmed plans to build a factory near Kenitra. The plant will come after Tesla consolidates its retail and distribution network.

With the Casablanca office now operational, Tesla has taken its first major step into Africa — opening the door to a future of electric mobility and clean energy across the continent.

As a steady stream of electric vehicles entered bays at the Lotus Hill supercharging station in Shenzhen's Futian District, a young man surnamed Sun gestured toward his rapidly charging sedan at a 600kW hypercharger.

""An hour elsewhere, just 20 minutes here,"" he said. ""This is Shenzhen speed.""

Sun's experience is soon expected to be shared by millions of EV owners across China, where the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) had reached 31.4 million by the end of 2024 -- accounting for more than half of the world's total, as shown by official data.

Such infrastructure development is critical for the world's largest EV market, where stations like Lotus Hill are engineering the future of mobility.

Since opening six months ago, this technological beacon in Shenzhen has become the preferred pitstop for discerning EV drivers, attracting over 600 vehicles daily.

Lotus Hill's 27 charging points, including four record-setting 600kW hyperchargers, run near capacity.

""One kilometer per second,"" explained a technician monitoring the control system. This means that an average family car can potentially secure over 80 percent of it's maximum battery life within 10 minutes of charging.

For drivers like Sun, who visits Lotus Hill twice weekly, the difference is transformative. ""No queues, even at rush hour. It rewrites your schedule,"" said Sun.

However, this innovation extends deeper.

The station's core innovation, China's first integration of ""solar storage, hypercharging, vehicle-grid interaction and OpenHarmony for Power operating system (OS),"" makes it a linchpin in supporting the nation's EV ambitions.

Lotus Hill's 152 kW solar canopy and 200 kWh battery storage bank combine to enable true ""green electrons for green wheels,"" but its transformative potential truly lies in its vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities.

Through V2G technology, equipped across 22 specialized charging piles offering 36 outlets, EVs transform into mobile power units.

A compelling demonstration occurred in March 2025 during China's largest V2G event, when the Lotus Hill station discharged 13,000 kWh into the grid daily -- equivalent to powering 1,600 households for a whole day.

Drivers, meanwhile, aren't just fueling the future. They are also profiting, earning 4 yuan (about 0.56 U.S. dollar) per kWh discharged, said Zhang Jiasen, a senior manager at the power supply bureau of Futian District under the Shenzhen branch of China Southern Power Grid.

Contrasted with off-peak charging costs of 0.4 yuan per kWh, the benefit is clear -- a net gain of 3.6 yuan per kWh.

Managing such complex interoperability, which involves integrating diverse vehicles and chargers, requires robust technical architecture. Notably, five advanced piles at Lotus Hill utilize OpenHarmony for Power, which is a domestically-developed industrial-grade operating system.

This system, on the one hand, secures digital assets by enhancing the information security of charging and swapping equipment, while on the other hand allowing for more flexible and efficient networking of devices, thereby improving the adaptability of charging and swapping equipment.

Zhang framed it as linguistic harmony.

""Charging technology for new energy vehicles is evolving rapidly. To ensure that the power grid 'speaks the same language' as various types of vehicles and charging piles, it is essential to achieve plug-and-play capabilities and data interoperability,"" he said. ""OpenHarmony for Power made it possible.""

""The supercharging station crystallizes our efforts in supporting Shenzhen's ambitious transformation into a global digital energy pioneer,"" Zhang added.

SHENZHEN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An EV charging station in south China's tech hub of Shenzhen is fueling a quiet transformation to green mobility amid the low hum of energy flow.

As a steady stream of electric vehicles entered bays at the Lotus Hill supercharging station in Shenzhen's Futian District, a young man surnamed Sun gestured toward his rapidly charging sedan at a 600kW hypercharger.

""An hour elsewhere, just 20 minutes here,"" he said. ""This is Shenzhen speed.""

Sun's experience is soon expected to be shared by millions of EV owners across China, where the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) had reached 31.4 million by the end of 2024 -- accounting for more than half of the world's total, as shown by official data.

Such infrastructure development is critical for the world's largest EV market, where stations like Lotus Hill are engineering the future of mobility.

Since opening six months ago, this technological beacon in Shenzhen has become the preferred pitstop for discerning EV drivers, attracting over 600 vehicles daily.

Lotus Hill's 27 charging points, including four record-setting 600kW hyperchargers, run near capacity.

""One kilometer per second,"" explained a technician monitoring the control system. This means that an average family car can potentially secure over 80 percent of it's maximum battery life within 10 minutes of charging.

For drivers like Sun, who visits Lotus Hill twice weekly, the difference is transformative. ""No queues, even at rush hour. It rewrites your schedule,"" said Sun.

However, this innovation extends deeper.

The station's core innovation, China's first integration of ""solar storage, hypercharging, vehicle-grid interaction and OpenHarmony for Power operating system (OS),"" makes it a linchpin in supporting the nation's EV ambitions.

President Donald Trump’s bill cuts Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and funding for infrastructure, public schools, and renewable energy—just to name a few. In New Hampshire, our state budget bills (HB1 and HB2) make similar cuts to healthcare, public schools, renewable energy, and housing. When we zoom in on what these bills do want to fund, however, the image is devastating: abundant funding for detention centers, border patrol, and immigration enforcement.

We’ve seen the videos and reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) encounters all over the country: Masked ICE agents grab people off the street, only for the government to admit later in court that they grabbed the wrong person. Legal immigrants kidnapped and sent to foreign countries, without due process or evidence of threat. International students persecuted for exercising their rights to free speech and protest. In Los Angeles, the military is being deployed against peaceful protestors who were trying to protect their neighbors from ICE raids.

Refusing refugees and detaining immigrants while fueling the climate crisis is a disgrace.

Our neighbors are disappearing around us, and our tax dollars are paying for their inhumane treatment. The Federal budget bill adds $160 billion to immigration enforcement operations. The current New Hampshire state budget for 2024-2025 allocated $1.4 million for the Northern Border Alliance to monitor the 58-mile border between New Hampshire and Canada, despite the fact that in October 2022 through December 2023, there were only 21 apprehensions by Border Patrol.

We’re seeing the devastating impacts of bloated budgets for ICE here and now. In recent months New Hampshire residents have had to watch their town’s police sign up one by one to partner with ICE to kidnap and terrorize their neighbors—including immigrants and refugees who are here legally, contributing to our communities after fleeing war zones or domestic violence. In New Hampshire, ICE operates in the Strafford County jail, where some of our neighbors are being held without due process. Government funding from ICE operations is set to expand the prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, where conditions are notoriously inhumane and immigrants are unlikely to be treated with dignity. Merrimack County and Hillsborough County have both requested to detain immigrants for ICE. My friends and I do not want this to be what our taxes pay for.

Instead, I’d rather have my tax money going to fund climate action: clean energy, resilient green housing, healthcare to care for people impacted by pollution and climate disasters like heatwaves. If we redirected just a fraction of the money we are wasting on ICE to transition our energy grid to clean energy, we could save billions of dollars in healthcare and disaster recovery costs every year. If we stopped spending money to imprison our immigrant neighbors, we could cover the costs of cleaning up the pollution at every fossil fuel facility in the country. If we stopped giving government handouts to billionaire fossil fuel CEOs, we could transition all the dirty fossil fuel facilities to clean energy and battery storage.

The United States contributes approximately 12% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions despite being only 4.2% of the world’s population. Those greenhouse gasses are fueling climate disasters around the world—creating climate refugees. People living along the coasts of countries around the world are being forced inland. People living in places more susceptible to drought or other climate fueled crises are making hard decisions to uproot their family and move someplace more resilient.

Refusing refugees and detaining immigrants while fueling the climate crisis is a disgrace. The United States is actively contributing to climate change by increasing our use of dirty fossil fuels, ignoring climate scientists, and eliminating environmental justice programs. By ignoring this issue we are costing our communities billions of dollars from storm cleanup and pollution impacts. The health costs of pollution and climate change alone cost more than $800 billion per year in medical bills and other downstream health costs—and that doesn’t include the billions of dollars it takes to clean up in a community after a hurricane or tornado. Yet when advocates for climate justice ask for more investments in clean, renewable energy, we are asked where that money will come from.

Our federal and state budgets have their priorities backwards. If we redirected our focus and tax dollars, we could solve an actual crisis that is hurting our economy and our health: climate change. It would be a much more useful avenue for our tax dollars than vilifying our neighbors who, by the way, also contribute taxes to the government.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60930367&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-06-15 15:01:01.649767

(KTVI) — Last year, months before the mall in Chesterfield, Missouri, was set to close and demolition began, residents noticed hundreds of Tesla vehicles parked in the lot.

One of the few structures still standing after the mall’s mass demolition is a Dillard’s on the west side of the former mall grounds. In front of it, a sprawling parking lot where hundreds of Teslas are parked.

The parked vehicles include a variety of models in red, dark blue, gray, white, and black colors. Among them are dozens of Tesla Cybertrucks, a 2023 model with a triangular look and flat stainless steel panels that the company compares to a full-sized pickup truck.

But why are all of these Teslas parked outside a Dillard’s that is no longer open?

The Staenberg Group, one of the partners leading the mall’s demolition and redevelopment, told Nexstar’s KTVI that it’s part of a continuation of a lease that originally began before the mall shut its doors last August.

“Tesla has a short-term lease to park Tesla cars at Chesterfield Mall. We relocated them to the Dillard’s parcel when we started mall demolition,” said Tim Lowe, senior vice president of leasing and development for The Staenberg Group, in a statement to KTVI.

Lowe says the Dillard’s lot has recently held anywhere from 200 to 400 Tesla vehicles at a time.

The Teslas will likely remain there until Dillard’s begins renovations with long-term plans to reopen the store, KTVI has learned.

Michael Staenberg, president of The Staenberg Group, says Tesla is around six months into a roughly 32-month lease, keeping vehicles parked outside the Dillard’s.

Tesla’s nearest dealership is three miles away from the mall on Chesterfield Airport Road, just west of a shopping center with several retailers. Staenberg says the dealership currently does not have enough space to park its entire inventory, so the Dillard’s parking lot serves as a temporary overflow site.

Staenberg says security has not been a major issue. The Staenberg Group has installed security cameras to monitor activity and directs workers to patrol the grounds. Some entry points are also blocked off with orange traffic cones.

Tesla, Inc. is known for its battery-powered electric vehicles. Elon Musk, a billionaire with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and the chairman of the X social media platform, has served as the Tesla CEO since 2008.

KTVI reached out to a Tesla press communications line for comment on the parked vehicles but did not immediately receive a response.",https://cbs4indy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/06/Tesla-Chesterfield-Dillards-2-e1749998221617.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-15 14:07:20.597707

According to an announcement from Talen, the energy will be produced at the company’s Susquehanna nuclear facility and provide power to Amazon facilities in the region, with additional plans to explore small-modular nuclear reactor (SMR) technology.

The energy will be supplied through the grid rather than directly from the nuclear plant as initially planned. This arrangement will help support the energy grid’s maintenance through service fees paid by Amazon.

Under the agreement, PPL Electric Utilities, an energy transmission company, will deliver the power to Amazon. Christine Martin, president of PPL Electric Utilities, said:

“Connecting large load customers like data centers to our transmission system helps lower the transmission component of energy bills for all customers, as large load customers pay significant transmission charges on our network.”

The move reflects the growing need for high-energy output infrastructure to power artificial intelligence and high-performance computing data centers as AI development becomes a key priority for global leaders.

Addressing an official event to mark the occasion, Joshi said: ""Our national goals are ambitious and clear, with a target of 50 per cent of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals. Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy, but it is at the heart of it and at the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat.""

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given us a vision to have renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption,"" the minister pointed out.

""India’s manufacturing capacity is increasing, and it will continue to increase. In view of this, the Prime Minister’s vision stresses the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub in the near future, the country should be able to fulfil the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources,"" Joshi observed.

India has a huge potential in the renewable energy sector, with the fourth largest wind power installed capacity in the world, and it is also the third largest renewable energy producer.

""No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality,"" Joshi said.

The minister underlined the three key issues for the wind energy sector, saying: ""First, we must combine wind with solar and storage (BESS) to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability. Secondly, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of Rs 3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs, and thirdly, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports.”

Underlining the dedicated efforts from the Centre to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, he said: ""The government is backing this sector with full seriousness. This year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53 per cent to Rs 26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.""

""The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,"" the minister added.

""I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.""

The minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, a coordinated national push is required, for which the Centre is focusing on five priorities. These include expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha, launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and tenders being readied.

Apart from this, the government is integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models, modernising the grid, and investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy. It is also taking steps to boost local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain.

The Union Minister also released reports on the ‘Wind Energy Roadmap’ and ‘Manufacturing Roadmap’ at the event. He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Atma Nirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India. The best-performing states in terms of wind capacity addition were also felicitated at the event. Karnataka was ranked first with a wind capacity addition of 1331.48 MW, followed by Tamil Nadu (1136.37 MW), and Gujarat (954.76 MW).

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Shripad Yesso Naik and Karnataka Energy Minister K.G. George were also present at the event.

Beyond national-level strategic dialogues, Chinese enterprises are actively driving China-Africa green energy collaboration by supporting localized sustainable electricity systems.","CHANGSHA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Green energy cooperation is a hot topic at the 4th China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, which is taking place in central China from June 12 to 15.

During the expo, cooperation deals between Chinese and African companies were made in photovoltaics and electric vehicles. In the expo's green energy exhibition hall, business representatives discussed potential collaborations amid the display of agricultural machinery, solar panels, and sleek electric vehicles.

EVS PLUS CHARGING SOLUTIONS

At the display stand of electric two-wheeler brand Yadea, electric scooters colored lemon yellow and olive green attracted crowds. These vehicles, with a length of 1.5 meters and a range of 130 kilometers, are specifically tailored for the road conditions in African countries.

""We adapt designs to local needs, like raising the chassis for Kenya's speed bumps to ensure safety and comfort,"" said Zhang Yi, Yadea's East & South Africa Market Operational Director. The enthusiasm for EVs in Africa stems from their energy cost savings and reduced dependence on imported fuel, and Zhang sensed this from the positive response to Yadea's new stores in Ethiopia and Morocco.

But this company's commitment extends beyond sales. ""We're helping clients improve EV ecosystems,"" Zhang added.

This company helps connect clients in African countries without adequate electricity infrastructure with Chinese suppliers of charging and battery-swapping solutions. This collaboration facilitates integration of energy infrastructure and vehicles, delivering convenient and green mobility solutions.

The necessity for improved industrial collaboration chains was echoed by Nigerian entrepreneur Jubril Arogundade at a forum of this expo. ""We want green energy for our vehicles, not diesel,"" he said, emphasizing the need for charging infrastructure and partnerships with green energy firms to address this issue.

China has consistently emphasized energy cooperation with African countries. According to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2025-2027), China encourages investment in renewable energy projects across Africa. China and African countries will promote the exchanges of expertise, the best practices, and innovative solutions in renewable energy.

Beyond national-level strategic dialogues, Chinese enterprises are actively driving China-Africa green energy collaboration by supporting localized sustainable electricity systems.

PRAGMATIC POWER PARTNERSHIPS

At the booth of Yingchen New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (YCSOLAR), the slogan ""Providing Full-Scenarios Green Power Solution"" was printed on backboard. Project Development Manager of the company's Overseas Business Department Zhang Zixu was introducing PV-storage-diesel integrated microgrid system to African merchants.

Designed to tackle Africa's energy access gaps in remote areas, this system integrates three core components: solar arrays for daytime generation, battery storage for nighttime use, and diesel backup for cloudy and rainy days. This system empowers clients to address the dual challenges of unreliable grid infrastructure and erratic power supply.

In the rural outskirts of the city of Kano, Nigeria, where daily grid electricity often falls short at just four hours, an entrepreneur partnered with YCSOLAR to electrify a sesame processing facility. The microgrid installation now enables a 22-hour daily operating schedule, transforming the plant into a new contributor to the local economy, with a projected payback period of four to five years.

""Stable power is the bedrock for industrialization,"" explained Zhang, who has participated in projects powering African households, stores, agribusinesses and even wildlife conservation areas through these tailored systems.

This pragmatic approach shows that Chinese firms are moving beyond just exporting equipment; they are now providing tailored energy solutions that align with Africa's developmental realities.

""China's global leadership in solar and electric vehicle innovation, combined with its competitive pricing, makes China-Africa collaboration essential for energy access on the African continent."" Ademola Ogunbanjo, president of Oando Clean Energy in Nigeria, told Xinhua during the expo.

SHARING URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE

In the Ghanaian capital of Accra, sanitation vehicles from Chinese environmental tech firm Infore Enviro operate silently before dawn, efficiently transporting waste along predetermined routes.

Zhang Hengsen, sales director of Overseas Business Department of Infore Enviro, is proud that the company has contributed to the upgrade of local urban sanitation technology and operational model.

Over the past two decades, the number of Infore Enviro vehicles operating in Ghana has grown from a hundred to nearly a thousand, and the company has gained the trust of local people through proven reliability, advanced transport efficiency and intelligent cleaning systems.

As Accra's population grows, municipal priorities have shifted from acquiring machinery to establishing sustainable waste management ecosystems.

Leveraging its domestic expertise, Infore Enviro designed a tailored system considering Accra's infrastructure limitations and demographic patterns, including a full waste collection and transfer network, encompassing mapped collection points, scheduled logistics and operational planning for processing stations. A skilled local team of technicians and managers was trained to ensure the stability of the system.

The sharing of environmental management experience has been affirmed. Local sanitation officials reported a clear improvement in cleanliness standards and operational efficiency, while citizens acknowledged the improved urban environment and healthier living conditions.

""China is facilitating Africa's green transition through providing affordable products, with cooperation extending beyond hardware exports to include knowledge transfer and local skills development -- aiming to enable the continent to build sustainable green development,"" said Xu Xiangping, head of the China-Africa Economic and Trade Promotion Council.

CHANGSHA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Green energy cooperation is a hot topic at the 4th China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, which is taking place in central China from June 12 to 15.

During the expo, cooperation deals between Chinese and African companies were made in photovoltaics and electric vehicles. In the expo's green energy exhibition hall, business representatives discussed potential collaborations amid the display of agricultural machinery, solar panels, and sleek electric vehicles.

EVS PLUS CHARGING SOLUTIONS

At the display stand of electric two-wheeler brand Yadea, electric scooters colored lemon yellow and olive green attracted crowds. These vehicles, with a length of 1.5 meters and a range of 130 kilometers, are specifically tailored for the road conditions in African countries.

""We adapt designs to local needs, like raising the chassis for Kenya's speed bumps to ensure safety and comfort,"" said Zhang Yi, Yadea's East & South Africa Market Operational Director. The enthusiasm for EVs in Africa stems from their energy cost savings and reduced dependence on imported fuel, and Zhang sensed this from the positive response to Yadea's new stores in Ethiopia and Morocco.

But this company's commitment extends beyond sales. ""We're helping clients improve EV ecosystems,"" Zhang added.

This company helps connect clients in African countries without adequate electricity infrastructure with Chinese suppliers of charging and battery-swapping solutions. This collaboration facilitates integration of energy infrastructure and vehicles, delivering convenient and green mobility solutions.

The necessity for improved industrial collaboration chains was echoed by Nigerian entrepreneur Jubril Arogundade at a forum of this expo. ""We want green energy for our vehicles, not diesel,"" he said, emphasizing the need for charging infrastructure and partnerships with green energy firms to address this issue.

China has consistently emphasized energy cooperation with African countries. According to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2025-2027), China encourages investment in renewable energy projects across Africa. China and African countries will promote the exchanges of expertise, the best practices, and innovative solutions in renewable energy.

Beyond national-level strategic dialogues, Chinese enterprises are actively driving China-Africa green energy collaboration by supporting localized sustainable electricity systems.

PRAGMATIC POWER PARTNERSHIPS

At the booth of Yingchen New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (YCSOLAR), the slogan ""Providing Full-Scenarios Green Power Solution"" was printed on backboard. Project Development Manager of the company's Overseas Business Department Zhang Zixu was introducing PV-storage-diesel integrated microgrid system to African merchants.

Designed to tackle Africa's energy access gaps in remote areas, this system integrates three core components: solar arrays for daytime generation, battery storage for nighttime use, and diesel backup for cloudy and rainy days. This system empowers clients to address the dual challenges of unreliable grid infrastructure and erratic power supply.

In the rural outskirts of the city of Kano, Nigeria, where daily grid electricity often falls short at just four hours, an entrepreneur partnered with YCSOLAR to electrify a sesame processing facility. The microgrid installation now enables a 22-hour daily operating schedule, transforming the plant into a new contributor to the local economy, with a projected payback period of four to five years.

""Stable power is the bedrock for industrialization,"" explained Zhang, who has participated in projects powering African households, stores, agribusinesses and even wildlife conservation areas through these tailored systems.

Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes. The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.

The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.

The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.

Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela’s approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.

Aircela has secured funding from notable investors, including Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple Labs’ Jeff Ubben, a board member at ExxonMobil; and Maersk Growth, the venture capital arm of A.P. Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk’s head of energy transition, emphasized the machine’s potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.

The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel’s purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.

Aircela plans to begin initial deployments of its machines in the fall of 2025, with a focus on off-grid, commercial and industrial users. The company’s goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.

Aircela’s gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.

As Aircela gets ready to roll out these machines, it will be interesting to see how this approach might help ease the transition to cleaner energy for everyone.

It's more to do with automation ... - Reddit,Not Available,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1lc4vd2/why_are_solar_panels_and_batteries_from_china_so/,"The first is that labour costs from BYD are lower, not because of much poorer salaries, but because of high levels of automation.

The US uses 6 times as many workers per GWh (shocking), so it's not surprising that labour costs much more.
High energy prices are crushing Europe's competitiveness Labour costs and the lack of automation are also relevant for Europe.
The main driver of lower labour costs has been automation: not having a human worker at all.","China dominates the supply chain of the main energy minerals. It's not only rolling out solar power rapidly at home, it's also exporting huge amounts of solar panels elsewhere. Increasingly, these panels are going to low-to-middle income countries who are hungry for energy, and will go after whatever's cheap: that's Chinese solar.

It produces three-quarters of the world's batteries. Its largest EV carmaker, BYD, is producing high-quality electric cars for as little as $10,000, and is growing rapidly in many markets across the world. BYD is now targetting the domestic battery market. CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, is pushing the limits of battery technologies, with claims that it can add 300 miles of charge in just 5 minutes (I have some doubts about battery degradation, but I'd obviously love this to be true). The list goes on.

European and American manufacturers are being left in the dirt. One response has been protectionist policies: slapping on tariffs and implementing import quotas. These were not good interventions if the goal was to increase the number of energy jobs in European and American markets, because most clean energy jobs are in deployment and maintenance rather than manufacturing, and since higher costs slow down the rollout of renewables, increasing prices reduces the total number of people working in clean energy (even if the number working in manufacturing increases).

These policies also fail to address the fact that they will not make Western manufacturers competitive in a global market.

The idea that China could only compete with Western manufacturers by cutting corners rather than genuine expertise stinks of arrogance. China does provide subsidies to battery manufacturers, and there is convincing evidence that the country has relied on forced labour in some of its supply chains. But, China mainly dominates these markets because it has produced a long-term industrial strategy for these technologies and has honed an optimised, modern supply chain as a result.

The notion that China's manufacturing output is purely the result of some centralised, governmental program is misguided; it has developed an incredibly competitive market with companies fighting for any edge to cut prices and beat competitors. The solar and battery industries are pretty brutal to be in, with slim margins.

why these technologies cost so much more in Europe and the US, and what could be done to reduce the gap (if that's actually what we want to do)? I'll focus on batteries, but the main lessons will be similar for solar PV.

Leading Chinese battery producers are also far ahead of their domestic competitors

the best Chinese manufacturers — BYD and CATL — also have much lower production costs than others in China. In the breakdown of where these costs come from, a few things stand out, which also explain the gap to Western manufacturers.

The first is that labour costs from BYD are lower, not because of much poorer salaries, but because of high levels of automation. BYD factories can have as few as 50 workers per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of production, compared to as many as 233 workers elsewhere.

The second is that “yields” tend to be higher, which leads to lower costs for cathode and anode production. ""Yields"" tell us the percentage of products that are good enough to be used in the next step of the supply chain. BYD has high yields, which means that nearly all of the components it builds meet the quality standards needed to be used in final products. Other manufacturers have medium or low yields, which means that a lot of components are of poor quality and need to be scrapped. That's throwing money away, and is not good for material use either.

Leading manufacturers have these high yields because they've developed extremely state-of-the-art, optimised production processes with minimal mistakes.

What makes up the cost of battery production, and how does this compare across regions?

The final cost of batteries consists of: the materials, labour to put them together, and the cost of processing materials into the final product (which is mostly energy).

Comparing the costs of China, South Korea, the European Union, and the US, we can see where the extra costs are coming from. Material costs are a bit higher in the EU and the US. But, the biggest difference in the US is the high cost of labour. In the EU, it's processing, because electricity is more expensive than it is in China and the US.

It's not just about low labour costs; Chinese manufacturers have become highly automated

The first thing US manufacturers — especially startups without experience — can do to increase cost competitiveness is increase yields. The “optimised” case means ramping them up to 94%, which means that manufacturers today are achieving quite a bit less than that today. A significant fraction of battery components go to scrap because they're of insufficient quality. This once again highlights how much leading manufacturers in China benefit from state-of-the-art, honed production processes with minimal room for error. Over 70% of electric car batteries that have ever been manufactured came from China, so this is not surprising.

Since China also refines a lot of the minerals and smaller components, its supply chains can become incredibly integrated, which also makes them more optimised.

The second big chunk is labour costs. Now, it's undeniable that wages in the US are higher than they are in China. But this is not necessarily because Chinese salaries are abysmally low. Yes, they are low by American or European standards, but wages for factory roles are often higher than they are in the US's southern neighbour, Mexico.

The biggest factor in labour costs is automation. The US uses 6 times as many workers per GWh (shocking), so it's not surprising that labour costs much more. China has invested heavily in automation, meaning many processes run with very little human input.

This is something else to keep in mind when considering the case for “bringing manufacturing jobs home.” There's certainly scope for this, but it is at odds with the fact that low costs often rely on automation, not human labour. Especially with the growth of artificial intelligence, some manufacturing jobs could be increasingly vulnerable.

High energy prices are crushing Europe's competitiveness

Labour costs and the lack of automation are also relevant for Europe. Another factor that is killing Europe's competitiveness — not just for batteries but for many industrial products — is the high electricity costs.

If energy accounts for a substantial portion of the cost of manufacturing, then it makes no sense to build stuff in places where electricity costs are high. Unfortunately, that's the dilemma for many European countries, especially compared to China and the US.

What about human rights abuses in Chinese labour?

China has very likely engaged in exploitative practices in some of its supply chains. the issues around cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not only an issue for China; other countries buy this cobalt too.

the forced labour of Uyghurs and other minority groups within China itself appears to be most prominent in the polysilicon industry for solar panel production, but there are also reports of it happening for lithium production, which is a key component of most batteries.

Xinjiang has become the main hub of clean energy technology production in China, in part because it is rich in resources and has cheap coal. The government's “Poverty Alleviation Through Labor Transfer” is promoted as a program where millions of people have been transferred across China to regions where they can find work (not just in manufacturing, but industries like agriculture too). While this is promoted as a voluntary program, many report that labourers don't actually have a choice.

Here is the US Department of Energy's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor. The US actually has a Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which aims to ban the import of goods produced with forced labour from Xinjiang. This — rather than thinking you're boosting domestic energy jobs, while actually hurting them — is actually a good reason to have stricter trade policies.

So it seems very likely that there are — or have been — at least some exploitative practices in China's supply chains. that's bad and unacceptable. But this is still not the reason (or is only a very small reason) why these goods from China are cheaper than elsewhere. The main driver of lower labour costs has been automation: not having a human worker at all.

What about all of the subsidies China hands out?

China has provided a range of financial support mechanisms to promote the development of its clean energy industries. These include potential tax breaks for battery makers that meet certain energy density and safety thresholds. CATL has also received substantial subsidies — in the order of the high hundreds of millions of dollars a year — to support research, innovation, and scale-up.

But China is not alone in doing this. Many countries — including the US — have used similar tools to support strategic industries. In its early years, Tesla received a $465 million loan from the Department of Energy (which it repaid) and has since benefited from billions in regulatory credits and tax incentives. The Inflation Reduction Act was set up to provide financial support for companies like Tesla, with potential subsidies in the tens of billions.

This is not a criticism of Tesla or the US; there are good reasons to do this. It called good industrial strategy. But you cannot support these programs while calling out China for “cheating” for doing the same.",,N,,2025-06-15 16:05:53.494964

Reaction from the Stakeholders Mike McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association set the stage for industry reaction.
The outcomes suggest that the GOP has delivered something for advanced biofuels that Democratic administrations, presumably in their zeal for electrifying the fleet, have never done and would not do.
Truly, a historic opportunity for advanced renewable fuels — an opportunity that must not be missed.","In Washington, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed rule to establish required Renewable Fuel Standard volumes and percentage standards for 2026 and 2027, as well as to partially waive the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and revise the associated percentage standard due to a shortfall in cellulosic biofuel production.

The proposed volume requirements are listed below.

Proposed Volume Requirements (billion RINs)a 2025 2026 2027 Cellulosic biofuel 1.19 1.30 1.36 Biomass-based diesel n/a 7.12 7.50 Advanced biofuel n/a 9.02 9.46 Renewable fuel n/a 24.02 24.46

a One RIN is equivalent to one ethanol-equivalent gallon of renewable fuel.

EPA is also proposing several regulatory changes to the RFS program, including reducing the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) generated for imported renewable fuel and renewable fuel produced from foreign feedstocks and removing renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS program (eRINs).

Public Hearing

EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on July 8, 2025, for the proposed rule. An additional session will be held on July 9, 2025, if necessary, to accommodate the number of testifiers that sign-up to testify. This hearing will be held virtually-only (i.e., there will be no in-person hearing). All attendees (including those who will not be presenting verbal testimony) must register by sending an email at RFS-Hearing@epa.gov.

The rule does not include a specific estimate of gasoline and diesel gallons produced by small refineries that will be exempted from the program in 2026 and 2027 – though it proposes a range. Including an estimate in the RVO formula will ensure that the biomass-based diesel volumes set by EPA in this rule are not unintentionally reduced by future small refinery exemptions.

Reaction from the Stakeholders

Mike McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association set the stage for industry reaction. He said, “The EPA’s initial proposal correctly recognizes that global feedstock supply and U.S. production capacity are more than sufficient to support a robust RVO, including at least 7.12 billion RINs of biomass-based diesel in 2026 (5.61 billion gallons) and 7.50 (5.86 billion gallons) in 2027. Strong RVOs are essential to diversifying the nation’s fuel supply, supporting rural economic development, lowering costs for consumers and businesses, and reinforcing America’s competitive edge in energy innovation. This proposal makes clear that the EPA understands the critical role advanced biofuels can play in their broader energy dominance strategy, and our industry is elated at this development.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) added, “Under the Biden administration, five biodiesel plants in Iowa closed or idled in part because RVOs were set too low. Today, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin turned the ship around, delivering a victory for American energy security and following through on their promise to support American agriculture. Biofuels lower gas prices, strengthen national security and drive economic growth in rural communities. Today’s announcement is welcome news for Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.”

U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) noted, “The EPA’s newly proposed rule rightly recognizes the vital role America’s farmers and biofuel producers play in strengthening our energy independence. Setting the conventional volume for fuels like ethanol at 15 billion gallons and boosting biomass-based diesel well above expectations is a strong win for Nebraska and the rest of rural America. I thank the administration for their continued commitment to agriculture and biofuels – their leadership supports Nebraska’s corn, soybean, and biofuel industries. I look forward to working with them to ensure these promising proposals are finalized and fully implemented.”

Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, issued the following statement: “While this proposal has some significant program changes that will require further study for us to better understand, overall it reflects the strength, resilience and growth potential of America’s biodiesel industry. The volumes signal real opportunity for domestic producers, especially here in Iowa, and we appreciate the EPA’s recognition of what this industry is capable of delivering.

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels’ Vice President of Federal Affairs, stated, “Today’s RFS proposal is a welcome and timely signal to U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF producers as well as America’s farmers and agricultural businesses. The industry has made major investments in domestic production capacity and feedstocks to meet America’s energy needs and provide consumers affordable, cleaner fuels. We anticipate this will have a tremendous beneficial impact for American farmers and agricultural communities and we look forward to working with President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin to finalize this rule and fully unleash U.S. clean fuel producers.

Joshua Shields, POET’s Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications added, “Today’s announcement from the EPA should provide much-needed, long-awaited certainty to our farmers and biofuel producers. This proposal makes clear that the EPA understands the critical role advanced biofuels can play in their broader energy dominance strategy, and our industry is elated at this development.”

The Bottom Line

It’s a historic win across the board for the US biofuels industry. The 15 billion gallons of ethanol are intact, a strong increase in biomass-based diesel, long overdue, and a proposed elimination of e-RINS for electric vehicles.

We also note that all of these changes and strong supports for advanced had long been sought by industry, and it clarifies where, lo these many years, the hold-ups have been ‚— clearly if the data supports strong increases this year, they supported strong increases in years past, and the responsibility not to follow the hard data lies with the executive officer of the United States, the President.

Many in the renewable fuels industry opposed the return of the GOP to power and in particular the return of President Trump. The outcomes suggest that the GOP has delivered something for advanced biofuels that Democratic administrations, presumably in their zeal for electrifying the fleet, have never done and would not do. Electric vehicles are still available for those who wish to drive them, but the strong domestic energy and rural revival, combined with the emissions profile of advanced fuels, has finally won the round. Is it game, set, match? Hardly. Boxing is rounds, and energy policymaking is boxing.

However, good news for the industry such as it has not seen in many years, is at hand. The coalition of farm-state lawmakers, crossing party lines, has prevailed. Even 45Z tax credits are still alive, as of this date. Truly, a historic opportunity for advanced renewable fuels — an opportunity that must not be missed.

But an opinion from the Senate parliamentarian claimed that the Clean Air Act waivers, which allows California to implement protective clean vehicle standards, are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.
“Because of the joint resolutions I signed today, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus Low NOX programs are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.","President Donald Trump signed Congressional Review Act resolutions to repeal three California clean vehicle programs. It will reverse the waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted California to implement Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty low-NOx Omnibus.

California plans to challenge the resolutions through legal action.

“For over 50 years, California has been a leader in developing and deploying the clean vehicle technologies that reduce pollution, protect vulnerable communities from smog and soot, and save consumers hard-earned money at the pump, all while supporting American manufacturing jobs and global competitiveness,” Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at Environmental Defense Fund. “We stand firmly with California and other states as they continue the vital work of improving air quality for their communities and fighting these unlawful attacks.”

Beginning in 1967, California was granted the right to its own protective clean vehicle standards under the Clean Air Act, which guaranteed California’s right to its own clean vehicle standards. The state’s Congressional delegation and former Governor Ronald Reagan recognized California as a leader in vehicle emissions control and allowed the EPA, under the law, to “approve the state’s protections unless [the] EPA can make specific findings that a program is not needed or cannot be achieved,” Environmental Defense Funds reported.

“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air and clean vehicles only benefits the fossil fuel industry, leaving Americans to foot the bill with higher fueling costs, limited vehicle choices, and more pollution,” Katherine García, director of Clean Transportation for All Sierra Club, said. “Instead of investing in electric vehicle manufacturing here in the U.S. and leading us towards a healthier future, the administration is dead set on pushing us backwards and ceding EV innovation and leadership to China. The Sierra Club will continue to fight for clean transportation solutions across the country.”

Lee Zeldin, EPA Administrator, passed the resolutions in May without public process for California’s three clean vehicle programs through congressionally-granted authority under the Clean Air Act. But an opinion from the Senate parliamentarian claimed that the Clean Air Act waivers, which allows California to implement protective clean vehicle standards, are not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

“The Newsom Administration’s irrational plan to ban gas-powered cars and trucks is an affront to the freedom of Californians and an economic burden to the whole country,” Representative Kevin Kiley, who introduced resolutions to overturn California’s three waivers, said.

According to the White House, “preemption of these programs is essential to preserving the Constitution’s allocation of power both among the States and between the States and the Federal Government.”

“These bipartisan measures prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions,” President Trump said in a statement on WhiteHouse.gov. “Because of the joint resolutions I signed today, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus Low NOX programs are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.

Musk's company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has already seen sales struggle to grow across many key geographies. Deliveries last quarter fell by 32% quarter over quarter, and by 13% year over year. Could the elimination of EV tax credits be a lethal blow to the struggling automaker? You might be surprised by the answer.

Tesla has a massive capital advantage

When it comes to potential regulation ""killing"" an operating business like Tesla, the first thing investors must consider is the effect on sales growth. Already, demand growth has been stagnating for Tesla. And while the company has teased new potential revenue sources like its robotaxi venture, there aren't many high-visibility milestones ahead that will meaningfully boost revenue over the next year or two. Analysts expect the company to refresh its existing lineup, but details are scarce on releasing any brand new models in 2025 or 2026. Even if a new model is released, it's unlikely that production will scale meaningfully over the next 12 to 24 months.

Where does this leave Tesla over the near term? In the same position it is in today, attempting to stoke demand for an increasingly stale lineup. Making the company's vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive -- the range of Federal incentives that Trump is proposing to eliminate -- could ultimately accelerate sales declines for Tesla. Any potential demand boost from releasing a more affordable Model Y or Model 3, meanwhile, could be completely offset by eliminated tax credits, resulting in minimal net savings for customers. In return, Tesla may need to compress its profit margins in order to keep demand growth on track.

Fortunately, Tesla has the capital to withstand a multiyear stagnation in sales growth. It has $16 billion in cash and equivalents on the books, more than every other competitor. Its profit margins are also positive -- a rarity in the EV world -- meaning it can afford to cut profits a bit without going into the red. Though it should be mentioned that Tesla has also relied on selling automotive regulator credits -- earned by selling carbon-free vehicles -- to maintain profitability. The company earned $595 million last quarter by selling these credits versus a net income of $409 million. But most of this ""free"" income from selling credits comes from states like California and New York, as well as incentive programs in the E.U., making them unlikely to be cut should U.S. federal incentives change.

Still, Tesla's biggest advantage is its $1 trillion market cap. Tesla could easily double the cash levels on its balance sheet while diluting shareholders by just 1% to 2%. This makes it very unlikely for the company to go under anytime soon. In fact, the elimination of EV tax credits could be a secret win for Tesla.

Eliminating EV tax credits could actually help Tesla

Many investors might be surprised to learn that ExxonMobil wishes for a carbon tax to be implemented. A carbon tax would make its output more expensive to buyers, potentially limiting demand. But if production costs rise, it's possible that many small competitors can't compete, leaving more of the market for well-capitalized behemoths like Exxon.

The same may prove true for Tesla. Most of its EV competition comes from unprofitable companies with minimal room for error like Rivian and Lucid Group. These EV makers are roughly 99% smaller than Tesla, with limited ability to tap the market for more capital at will. The elimination of EV tax credits would hurt them more than Tesla, potentially leaving more long-term market share for Musk and his investors.

Of course, the immediate effect will be negative for Tesla and the rest of the industry. But it should be stressed that bills are not laws. The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned. But the elimination of these subsidies certainly won't ""kill"" Tesla. In fact, there's an argument that it could be a long-term advantage due to lessened competition.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles could soon be eliminated.

Another critical federal program is also at risk.

These changes would only add to the mounting problems for Tesla.

These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has long been a volatile stock, but it's also become a very controversial name in recent months. Shares trade at a pricey valuation with a market cap of roughly $1 trillion, fueled by the promise of greater electric vehicle sales and a potential new robotaxi business. Yet sales growth for the company is struggling across many key geographies with CEO Elon Musk often making headlines for all the wrong reasons.

If you're monitoring Tesla stock, here are two numbers you need to be tracking.

Watch what happens with Trump's new bill

A recent bill backed by President Donald Trump proposes eliminating tax credits for electric vehicles. These tax credits range from $4,000 to $7,500 for qualified vehicles. Right now, more than 90% of Tesla's sales come from just two models: The Model 3 and Model Y. Both qualify for federal tax credits, making them much more affordable for buyers. Surveys show that more than one-third of Tesla buyers wouldn't have purchased their vehicle without a tax credit.

Monitor what happens to these figures closely. Will federal incentives drop to $0, or will they be reduced significantly? The fate of these tax credits is very unclear right now, but their elimination would likely further dampen Tesla's sales growth in the quarters and years to come.

As troubling as the loss of the EV tax credit would be, there's another number to track that could be even more influential.

Last quarter, Tesla posted a $409 million net profit. That profit was partially realized by $595 million in automotive regulatory credits -- accrued credits that Tesla sells to competitors that need to comply with emission standards. Most of these credits are likely earned under state programs, but some are generated from federal programs. If these programs are cut, Tesla will lose a critical revenue source with nearly 100% profit margins.

With EV deliveries already declining, the loss of federal EV tax credits or automotive regulatory credits could put Tesla in an even more precarious position.

Columbia alone lost over 400 NIH grants in retaliation for campus protests.
The CDC has paused all HIV research.
What kind of country are we becoming if we let ideology sink our science?","Chinese Admiral Zheng He was as imperialist as any. Half a century before the Europeans began their transatlantic age of conquest, he led the world’s most sophisticated maritime expeditions, backed by China’s superior technology and a centralized state.

But after Zheng He’s final voyage in the 1430s, political leaders fearful of external influence shut it all down. Shipbuilding ceased. Scientific knowledge stagnated. Poised to shape the modern world, China turned inward — and missed its moment.

In 2025, America may be risking the same fate.

Since returning to office in January, the Trump administration has cancelled more than 3,000 already-approved federal research grants totaling over $8 billion, according to the Economist. That includes more than $750 million in NIH biomedical research and $1.5 billion in NSF grants affecting topics from clean energy to cybersecurity education.

The consequences aren’t abstract. Researchers across the country are abandoning promising work on Alzheimer’s, pandemic prevention, HIV treatment, mental health, teacher training and clean water. In many cases, the research was nearly complete, with data collected but no funding left to analyze or publish it.

“You can’t tell me this is about efficiency,” Caroline Hardin, a professor whose $230,000 NSF grant to expand computer science teaching was abruptly terminated, told NEA Today. “It’s so profoundly inefficient.”

In Atlanta, an HIV clinic is shutting down parts of its operation. At Western Washington University, researchers studying how to recruit women into cybersecurity can no longer publish what they learned. At UMass Amherst, a $6 million clean-energy initiative designed to ensure low-income communities aren’t left behind is gone.

Meanwhile, elite institutions like Columbia, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania are seeing grants revoked not over questions of scientific merit but for political reasons. Columbia alone lost over 400 NIH grants in retaliation for campus protests. NIH staff received direct orders to cut any projects using phrases like “Latinx,” “gender minority” or “climate justice.” More NIH grants were terminated in four months of 2025 than in the previous 12 years combined, per ProPublica.

The result is a quiet collapse of America’s scientific engine — and the clearest sign yet that scientific inquiry, once seen as apolitical infrastructure, is now a target.

“We’re in for multiple pandemics,” epidemiologist Ralph Baric, whose COVID-era vaccine work was defunded, told the Economist. “I guess we’ll have to buy the drugs from the Chinese.”

Critics say these cuts amount to a de facto purge — gutting research related to diversity, climate, public health or anything that challenges the administration’s worldview. But even “neutral” science isn’t safe. The National Weather Service has halved its weather balloon launches. NOAA staff have been slashed. NASA’s Earth observation satellites may soon be defunded. The CDC has paused all HIV research. Across federal labs, basic supplies like gloves and reagents are running short.

“It feels like a ship going down,” UMass professor Krista Harper told NEA Today.

On Saturday, in more than 2,000 U.S. towns and cities, Americans gathered for “No Kings Day,” a protest movement against Trump’s authoritarian impulses — including his attacks on science. Organizers say the military parade in Washington DC wasn’t just a spectacle but a symbol of power replacing process.

“We don’t do kings in America,” Ezra Levin of No Kings–organizer Indivisible told ABC News. “We don’t let one man decide what truth gets funded.”

The science community agrees. A letter signed by over 20 Nobel laureates and thousands of global researchers this week urged the NIH director to reverse the cuts. Lawsuits are mounting. But in the meantime, damage is being done — not just to labs and careers, but to the very idea that facts should guide policy.

In 1433, China’s rulers shut down their navy to control their narrative. The decision helped them keep power — but it ceded the future.

Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy, Mr Shripad Yesso Naik, and the Energy Minister in the Government of Karnataka, Mr K.G. George, were also present on this occasion.

Mr Pralhad Joshi said that to become a global manufacturing hub, India needs energy, be it solar energy, wind energy or any other form of energy.

“Our national goals are ambitious and clear: 50% of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals. Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy, but it is at the heart of it and the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat,” said the minister.

Underlining the vision of the Indian Prime Minister (PM), Mr Joshi said, “PM Mr Narendra Modi gave us a vision to have ‘renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption’.”

India’s manufacturing capacity is increasing, and it will continue to increase.

Given this, PM’s vision stresses the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub in the near future, it should be able to fulfil the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources, said the minister.

India has huge potential in the renewable energy sector, as it has the world’s fourth-largest wind power installed capacity and is the third-largest renewable energy producer. “No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality, said the minister.

The minister underlined the 3 key issues for the Wind Energy sector:

First, we must combine wind with solar and storage to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability.

Second, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of Rs 3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs.

Third, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our targets, but to boost exports.

Underlining the dedicated efforts from the Indian Government to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, Mr Joshi said, “The Government is backing this sector with full seriousness. This year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53%, to Rs 26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.”

“The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,” the minister added.

The Minister said, “ I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.”

The Minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, we need a coordinated national push.

That is why we are focusing on 5 priorities:

Expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha.

Launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, and tenders being readied.

Integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models.

Modernising the grid, investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy.

Boosting local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain

Minister Joshi also released reports on the Wind Energy Roadmap and the Manufacturing Roadmap at the event.

He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Aatmanirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India.

Best performing States in terms of Wind Capacity addition were also felicitated at the event.

Karnataka was first with a wind capacity addition of 1331.48 MW, followed by Tamil Nadu (1136.37 MW) and Gujarat (954.76 MW).

Global Wind Day is celebrated on 15th June to mark the development of wind energy, and with the Government’s consistent policy support, the Wind Energy Sector has displayed substantial growth.

Organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the event, through the participation of key stakeholders from central and state government authorities, DISCOMs, CPSUs, the wind industry, academia, think tanks, etc, aims to facilitate conversations on key aspects, including the country’s progress of wind energy development.

Located in the high-end Crystal Tower at Casablanca Marina, the office signals Tesla’s long-term commitment to Morocco as both a regional hub and an entry point into the African market.

Prior to this move, Tesla had quietly laid the groundwork for its North African presence, having installed hybrid superchargers in Casablanca and Tangier in 2021. The network has since expanded to additional cities including Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, and Agadir.

The office will also provide after-sales support, technical assistance, and staff training, indicating Tesla’s intention to deliver a fully integrated ecosystem tailored to local needs.

Why Morocco? Tesla’s strategic bet on Africa’s renewable future

The subsidiary is jointly managed by Rafael Arqueza Martin and Shahin Oliver Khorshidpanah, with backing from Tesla International B.V. and Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V. The leadership structure highlights the company’s strategy of combining global expertise with on-the-ground operational efficiency.

Tesla’s decision to anchor its African operations in Morocco reflects the country’s growing appeal as a clean-energy and automotive hub.

With an expanding renewable energy sector, an established car manufacturing industry, and progressive investment policies, Morocco offers Tesla a strong foundation for long-term growth. The move also aligns with Morocco’s broader ambition to achieve carbon neutrality and foster high-tech economic development.

In April 2025, Tesla Chairman Elon Musk confirmed plans to build a factory near Kenitra. The plant is expected to follow the consolidation of Tesla’s distribution and retail network, using Morocco as a springboard for further continental expansion.

With the Casablanca office now operational, Tesla has made its first concrete step into the African landscape offering a glimpse into a future where electric mobility and clean energy converge across the continent.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/SgDktkuTURBXy9mMDQ3Yzc1YS1iZjdmLTQwNDYtODAzZC04YWU3MzBhZjM2YzMuanBlZ5KVAwDMUc0FoM0DKpMFzQSwzQJ2,N,,2025-06-15 13:05:19.628335

Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.
The reversal means that power plants that were slated to be retired will now continue running.
Power plants are the second-biggest emitters of planet-warming pollution in the United States, making up around a quarter of the country’s climate pollution.
“You’re starting to see coal fired power plants that were expected to retire continue to operate,” Jenks added.","The Trump administration recently announced its intention to rescind key Biden-era EPA rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions and mercury pollution from coal and natural gas power plants that stem from the 2015 Obama “Clean Power Plan”, Biden’s “Clean Power Plan 2.0”, and the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that these regulations were seen as overly burdensome to industry and were stifling economic growth. The proposed rollback would eliminate caps on carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal plants and future natural gas plants, as well as relax limits on mercury and other toxic air pollutants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news conference that Biden-era carbon pollution standards for power plants “suffocate” the economy in order to protect the environment. Zeldin, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in January, stated that the agency’s announcement was a huge step forward in energy dominance for the U.S., while promising that no power plants would emit more than they already do. Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.

The proposed repeals are two of the most consequential moves from Trump’s EPA as the administration continues dismantling Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. The reversal means that power plants that were slated to be retired will now continue running.

The agency didn’t announce any intent to rewrite regulations to replace the Biden rules on carbon emissions, which could effectively leave carbon emissions from US power plants unregulated if the proposed repeal is finalized. Zeldin announced the agency will revise the rule on mercury and other toxic air pollution, proposing to get rid of a Biden-era rule finalized last year.

Power plants are the second-biggest emitters of planet-warming pollution in the United States, making up around a quarter of the country’s climate pollution. US power plants alone contribute 3% of total global climate pollution.

By seeking to repeal the carbon rules with no replacement, the administration’s proposal is more sweeping than the power plant regulations finalized during Trump’s first term, Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN.

It would result in aging coal plants operating for longer periods of time and allow new gas plants to be built with looser pollution restrictions, Jenks said.

“You’re starting to see coal fired power plants that were expected to retire continue to operate,” Jenks added.

Zeldin officially declared the end to the Biden era war on the American energy industry.

Eco-activist agitators and leftist power-mongers who want to control Americans through environmental regulations are upset.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,’’ added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

However, I am inclined to think American health would be better served by the actions being taken by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as well as making energy inexpensive and readily available.

Environmental fear-mongering based on pseudoscience no longer has the power it once had.

The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned.","Billionaire Elon Musk is fighting to make sure federal tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) -- a key subsidy that makes buying EVs more affordable -- remain in place. President Donald Trump's new bill seeks to eliminate these tax incentives, which would otherwise be in place until 2032.

Musk's company Tesla (TSLA 2.00%) has already seen sales struggle to grow across many key geographies. Deliveries last quarter fell by 32% quarter over quarter, and by 13% year over year. Could the elimination of EV tax credits be a lethal blow to the struggling automaker? You might be surprised by the answer.

Tesla has a massive capital advantage

When it comes to potential regulation ""killing"" an operating business like Tesla, the first thing investors must consider is the effect on sales growth. Already, demand growth has been stagnating for Tesla. And while the company has teased new potential revenue sources like its robotaxi venture, there aren't many high-visibility milestones ahead that will meaningfully boost revenue over the next year or two. Analysts expect the company to refresh its existing lineup, but details are scarce on releasing any brand new models in 2025 or 2026. Even if a new model is released, it's unlikely that production will scale meaningfully over the next 12 to 24 months.

Where does this leave Tesla over the near term? In the same position it is in today, attempting to stoke demand for an increasingly stale lineup. Making the company's vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive -- the range of Federal incentives that Trump is proposing to eliminate -- could ultimately accelerate sales declines for Tesla. Any potential demand boost from releasing a more affordable Model Y or Model 3, meanwhile, could be completely offset by eliminated tax credits, resulting in minimal net savings for customers. In return, Tesla may need to compress its profit margins in order to keep demand growth on track.

Fortunately, Tesla has the capital to withstand a multiyear stagnation in sales growth. It has $16 billion in cash and equivalents on the books, more than every other competitor. Its profit margins are also positive -- a rarity in the EV world -- meaning it can afford to cut profits a bit without going into the red. Though it should be mentioned that Tesla has also relied on selling automotive regulator credits -- earned by selling carbon-free vehicles -- to maintain profitability. The company earned $595 million last quarter by selling these credits versus a net income of $409 million. But most of this ""free"" income from selling credits comes from states like California and New York, as well as incentive programs in the E.U., making them unlikely to be cut should U.S. federal incentives change.

Still, Tesla's biggest advantage is its $1 trillion market cap. Tesla could easily double the cash levels on its balance sheet while diluting shareholders by just 1% to 2%. This makes it very unlikely for the company to go under anytime soon. In fact, the elimination of EV tax credits could be a secret win for Tesla.

Eliminating EV tax credits could actually help Tesla

Many investors might be surprised to learn that ExxonMobil wishes for a carbon tax to be implemented. A carbon tax would make its output more expensive to buyers, potentially limiting demand. But if production costs rise, it's possible that many small competitors can't compete, leaving more of the market for well-capitalized behemoths like Exxon.

The same may prove true for Tesla. Most of its EV competition comes from unprofitable companies with minimal room for error like Rivian and Lucid Group. These EV makers are roughly 99% smaller than Tesla, with limited ability to tap the market for more capital at will. The elimination of EV tax credits would hurt them more than Tesla, potentially leaving more long-term market share for Musk and his investors.

Of course, the immediate effect will be negative for Tesla and the rest of the industry. But it should be stressed that bills are not laws. The EV tax credit may end up in place until 2032 like previously planned. But the elimination of these subsidies certainly won't ""kill"" Tesla. In fact, there's an argument that it could be a long-term advantage due to lessened competition.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/821165/gettyimages-1502960058-1200x600-7cb9712.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 13:05:15.487538

It’s important to understand the nuances of wind and how it is such a great clean, renewable, and sustainable source of energy.

But not everyone is aware of how wind works to generate energy. Let’s take this opportunity to fill in some gaps you might have about wind, wind turbines, and the important of global wind as part of the transition to a net zero world.

What is wind? Wind is caused by uneven heating of the earth’s surface by the sun. Because the earth’s surface is made up of different types of land and water, the earth absorbs the sun’s heat at different rates. One example of this uneven heating is the daily wind cycle. Air under high pressure moves toward areas of low pressure – and the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the air flows and the stronger the wind!

Why is wind significant as a renewable energy source? Wind is a renewable energy source that can be used to create electricity with fewer environmental impacts than many other energy sources. It’s renewable because the wind is always blowing somewhere. Thanks to wind turbine technology, We can harness the natural and endless power of the wind to generate electricity for homes and businesses without worrying about depleting the supply.

Is wind energy a recent phenomenon? Wind energy is not new — wind power has been used for thousands of years. As early as 5000 BCE, Egyptians propelled boats along the Nile River using the wind. Wind energy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources. Wind energy is an alternative to energy produced by burning fossil fuels. Generating wind energy is all about kinetic energy — the energy of motion. It produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, and supports the global fight against climate change.

What is a wind turbine? According to DOE’s Wind Energy Technologies Office, a typical large-sized wind turbine contains about 8,000 parts within its foundation, tower, nacelle, and blades. There are over 500 facilities manufacturing wind turbine components in the US. Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of shapes and sizes, but the most common design is the one with 3-blades mounted on a horizontal axis. Their output ranges from as small as 100 kilowatts to as big as 12 megawatts. They can be placed in a huge range of locations: on hills, in open landscapes, fixed to the bottom of the sea – and we can even have floating turbines in deep waters!

What are the components of a wind turbine? The Global Wind Day folks offer an excellent overview of a wind turbine. A wind vane at the top of each turbine communicates to the turbine the speed and direction the wind is blowing. The turbine then rotates on the tower to face into the wind, and the blades rotate on their axis to create maximum resistance against the wind. The wind starts turning the blades which are connected to a hub and a low-speed shaft. The low-speed shaft spins at the same speed as the blades (7-12 revolutions per minute). To generate faster rotational speed for the generator to produce electricity, most turbines have a gearbox that multiplies the rotational speed of the low-speed shaft by over 100 times to the high-speed shaft, which rotates up to 1,500 revolutions per minute. This is connected to a generator, which converts the kinetic energy into electricity.

How does a wind turbine work to create energy? Wind turbines take the kinetic energy that’s in the wind and convert that kinetic energy into mechanical power. It’s mostly used in the form of electricity. A group of wind turbines is called a wind farm. On a wind farm, turbines provide power to the electrical grid. These turbines can be found on land (onshore) or at sea (offshore). The turbine converts the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power. It’s actually pretty simple: The energy in wind turns the turbine’s blades around a rotor that is connected to the main shaft, which itself spins a generator to create electricity.

What variables determine how much electricity a turbine can produce?

Wind speed: Stronger winds allow us to produce more electricity. Higher turbines are more receptive to strong winds. This means wind turbines generate electricity at wind speeds of 4 – 25 meters per second.

Blade radius: The larger the radius or “swept area” of the blades, the more electricity can be produced. Doubling the blade radius can result in four times more power.

Air density: “Heavier” air exerts more lift on a rotor. Air density is a function of altitude, temperature and air pressure. High altitude locations have lower air pressure and “lighter” air so they are less productive turbine locations. The dense “heavy” air near sea level drives rotors more effectively.

What is the potential for a global wind labor force? Europe’s wind workforce is set to grow to 600,000 people by 2030, up from 370,000 today. This comes to show the huge growth and job creation potential of wind energy. But hiring more than 200,000 additional people over just 6 years will be challenging. As an industry, we need to close this skills gap. This means working closer with schools and universities, scaling up vocational training and reskilling programs, setting up retention programs and much more. But above all, it requires us to raise awareness of the diverse and exciting job opportunities in wind energy. Wind jobs are still under the radar. Our industry has been slow to embrace digital storytelling and social media.

Why is Global Wind Day important? Global Wind day is a moment to bring wind energy to life and make it more accessible. Organizers of Global Wind Day 2025 want new generations and new audiences to get inspired to pursue a career in wind. Advocates for global wind workers are hopeful because Gen Z is climate-conscious and career-driven, with 73% saying they are concerned about climate change, and 65% saying environmental impact influences their career choices. Global Wind Day serves as a reminder of the urgent need to transition to clean energy solutions. It aims to educate people about how wind power works, its environmental advantages, and the innovations transforming the wind sector.

How does Global Wind Day create community? The day also honors the scientists, engineers, and environmentalists who have been working to make wind energy more efficient and accessible. In a time when the world is facing increasing environmental challenges, Global Wind Day encourages nations, industries, and individuals to invest in and support green energy alternatives. With growing awareness and commitment, wind energy holds the promise of a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for all.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wind-turbines-over-Providence-Harbor-e1689955623268.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 13:05:54.290113

But why are all of these Teslas parked outside a Dillard’s that is no longer open?
Lowe says the Dillard’s lot has recently held anywhere from 200 to 400 Tesla vehicles at a time.
Michael Staenberg, president of The Staenberg Group, says Tesla is around six months into a roughly 32-month lease, keeping vehicles parked outside the Dillard’s.","CHESTERFIELD, Mo. (KTVI) — Last year, months before the mall in Chesterfield, Missouri, was set to close and demolition began, residents noticed hundreds of Tesla vehicles parked in the lot.

One of the few structures still standing after the mall’s mass demolition is a Dillard’s on the west side of the former mall grounds. In front of it, a sprawling parking lot where hundreds of Teslas are parked.

The parked vehicles include a variety of models in red, dark blue, gray, white, and black colors. Among them are dozens of Tesla Cybertrucks, a 2023 model with a triangular look and flat stainless steel panels that the company compares to a full-sized pickup truck.

But why are all of these Teslas parked outside a Dillard’s that is no longer open?

The Staenberg Group, one of the partners leading the mall’s demolition and redevelopment, told Nexstar’s KTVI that it’s part of a continuation of a lease that originally began before the mall shut its doors last August.

“Tesla has a short-term lease to park Tesla cars at Chesterfield Mall. We relocated them to the Dillard’s parcel when we started mall demolition,” said Tim Lowe, senior vice president of leasing and development for The Staenberg Group, in a statement to KTVI.

Lowe says the Dillard’s lot has recently held anywhere from 200 to 400 Tesla vehicles at a time.

The Teslas will likely remain there until Dillard’s begins renovations with long-term plans to reopen the store, KTVI has learned.

Michael Staenberg, president of The Staenberg Group, says Tesla is around six months into a roughly 32-month lease, keeping vehicles parked outside the Dillard’s.

Tesla’s nearest dealership is three miles away from the mall on Chesterfield Airport Road, just west of a shopping center with several retailers. Staenberg says the dealership currently does not have enough space to park its entire inventory, so the Dillard’s parking lot serves as a temporary overflow site.

Staenberg says security has not been a major issue. The Staenberg Group has installed security cameras to monitor activity and directs workers to patrol the grounds. Some entry points are also blocked off with orange traffic cones.

Tesla, Inc. is known for its battery-powered electric vehicles. Elon Musk, a billionaire with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and the chairman of the X social media platform, has served as the Tesla CEO since 2008.

KTVI reached out to a Tesla press communications line for comment on the parked vehicles but did not immediately receive a response.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/06/Tesla-Chesterfield-Dillards-2-e1749998221617.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-15 12:14:03.742463

In a post on X earlier, Joshi also said that India has achieved 51.5 GW wind capacity, 150 per cent growth in a decade and is now exporting turbines and components globally.

The minister also said that India has the fourth-largest wind power capacity in the world, while it is the third-largest renewable energy producer.

Addressing the Global Wind Day celebrations in Bengaluru, the minister also said that India is going to become the manufacturing hub of the world. “We will be competing with many of our neighbours, including Vietnam and China. So when we want to compete there, the basic thing we need is power. So in this power, we need renewable energy and conventional energy also, but we need more renewable power,” Joshi said.

In a post on X earlier, Joshi also said that India has achieved 51.5 GW wind capacity, 150 per cent growth in a decade and is now exporting turbines and components globally. “We are moving steadily towards the 100 GW wind target by 2030, including 30 GW from offshore projects, backed by strong policy reforms and a robust manufacturing ecosystem,” he said on the occasion of Global Wind Day.

Underlining the three key critical issues for the wind energy sector, the minister said that the government is backing this sector with full seriousness and this year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53 per cent, to Rs 26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.

Elaborating on the issues, he said that first, we must combine wind with solar and storage to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability. “Second, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of Rs 3.90 per unit is too high and we must work together to reduce costs. And third, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports,” the minister said.

“I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 KW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally. The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,” the minister added.

On the future growth in the wind energy sector, Joshi also emphasised to fully unlock national wind potential, especially in some states. “We need a coordinated national push and that is why we are focusing on 5 priorities — expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, modernising the grid, investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy and boosting local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain,” he said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/06/15/1928161-india-achieved-.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 14:05:10.459956

Speaking at a conference of stakeholders in Bengaluru, Minister Shri Joshi emphasized the need for a coordinated national push to fully unlock India’s wind potential, identifying the expansion into new states including Odisha as a top priority. Secretary MNRE, Shri Santosh Sarangi graced the occasion.

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Shri Shripad Yesso Naik and Karnataka’s Energy Minister Shri K.G. George were also present at the event, which saw felicitation of top-performing states in wind capacity addition, with Karnataka leading the charge. MNRE Secretary Shri Sarangi Presented Road Map on Wind Energy.

“To become a global manufacturing hub, India needs energy, be it solar, wind, or any other form,” stated Shri Joshi. He expressed pride in India’s robust wind turbine manufacturing capabilities, with 33 models ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW produced by 14 companies, meeting both domestic and global demands.

Highlighting the five key priorities for accelerating wind energy deployment, Minister Joshi specifically named Odisha, alongside Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, as states targeted for significant expansion. This comes as a strong signal for the coastal state, which the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) has identified with an estimated wind power potential of 12,129 MW at 150 meters hub height.

Despite this substantial potential, Odisha currently has no grid-connected wind power projects. However, the state’s proactive “Odisha Renewable Energy Policy 2022” aims to attract investments in clean energy, including wind, and has already seen recent approvals for wind energy projects. The Single Window Committee of the state’s Energy Department recently granted in-principle approval for two wind power projects totaling 95.7 MW, with an investment of ₹1191.47 crores. Furthermore, the “Utkarsh Odisha – Make in Odisha Conclave 2025” attracted investment proposals worth ₹4.33 lakh crore in the renewable energy sector for the state.

Potential wind energy sites in Odisha have been identified across nine districts, including Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Puri, Khordha, Jagatsinghpur, Ganjam, Balasore, and Kendrapara. The push for wind energy in Odisha is crucial not only for achieving national renewable energy targets, including India’s commitment to 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030, but also for enhancing the state’s energy security and fostering industrial growth.

Minister Shri Joshi also released the ‘Wind Energy Roadmap’ and ‘Manufacturing Roadmap’ reports at the event, which he stated would serve as guiding frameworks for building a strong and “Aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) wind energy ecosystem in India.

Part of the loan will benefit from a European Fund for Sustainable Development first-loss cover guarantee

The project is expected to generate approximately 3,000 GWh of clean energy and avoid up to 1.4 million metric tonnes of emissions per year, supporting Egypt’s decarbonisation goals

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), African Development Bank (AfDB), and British International Investment (BII), the United Kingdom’s development finance institution and impact investor, are providing a total of US$ 479.1 million to Obelisk Solar Power SAE, a special-purpose vehicle incorporated in and owned by Scatec ASA. This financing will support the development of a 1.1 GW solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant integrated with a 200 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) in the country’s Nagaa Hammadi region.

The EBRD will provide a loan of up to US$ 173.5 million, of which US$ 101.9 million will benefit from a European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD+) first-loss cover guarantee for the first 18 years, in addition to a US$ 6.5 million grant from the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund.

The AfDB’s financing package of US$ 184.1 million includes US$ 125.5 million of ordinary resources, as well as concessional funding from AfDB-managed special funds the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa worth US$20 million, and US$18.6 million from the Canada-African Development Bank Climate Fund, a partnership between the AfDB and the government of Canada. A further US$ 20 million will be channelled from the CIF’s Clean Technology Fund through the AfDB.

BII financing includes a US$ 100 million concessional loan and a US$ 15 million returnable grant that helps lower the overall cost of the BESS part of the project, making it more financially viable and affordable, while attracting private-sector participation and creating models for future investments. BII’s financing is subject to drawdown conditions.

The project’s blended financing of US$ 479.1 million corresponds to approximately 80 per cent of the total estimated capital expenditure of US$ 590 million.

The integrated power plant will be developed by Scatec, a leading renewable energy solutions provider, and built in two phases. The first phase, with 561 MW of solar and 100 MW/200 MWh of battery storage, aims to start operations in the first half of 2026. The second phase, with 564 MW of solar, aims to start operations in the second half of 2026. The energy will be sold under a US dollar-denominated 25-year power purchase agreement with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company, backed by a sovereign guarantee.

On completion, it will be the first integrated solar photovoltaic and battery storage project of this scale in Egypt, and a significant milestone in the country’s energy transition. Egypt aims to reach 42 per cent of renewables in its power mix by 2030. The solar power plant is expected to generate approximately 3,000 GWh per year of additional renewable power, which will enhance grid stability and manage peak demand. It will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1.4 million metric tonnes annually.

The facility will support the diversification of Egypt’s energy mix and increase the share of renewable energy, which will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing the country's decarbonisation goals.

Harry Boyd-Carpenter, EBRD Managing Director for Sustainable Infrastructure, said: “We are delighted to work with our longstanding partners Scatec, the AfDB and BII to support this transformative project. It takes Egypt’s green energy transition to another level by harnessing the power of the sun, not just during the day but also at night, thanks to the combination of solar and battery storage. The project addresses the growing demand for electricity and reduces the need to import expensive fossil fuels. It contributes to the goals of Egypt’s flagship Nexus on Water, Food and Energy that was launched at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, and for which the EBRD is Egypt’s leading partner on the energy pillar.”

Wale Shonibare, the AfDB’s Director of Energy Financial Solutions, Policy and Regulations, noted: “This project exemplifies the scale of renewable energy potential across Africa and demonstrates how strong partnerships and innovative solutions can advance the energy transition and foster sustainable economic development. It has a high demonstration and replication potential for similar initiatives across the continent.”

BENGALURU, JUNE 15, 2025: On the occasion of Global Wind Day 2025, Union Minister of New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi addressed a conference of stakeholders here in Bengaluru today and said that Wind Energy is at the centre of India’s strategy for the renewable energy sector.

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Shripad Yesso Naik and the Energy Minister in the Government of Karnataka, K.G. George, were also present on this occasion. Pralhad Joshi said that in order to become a global manufacturing hub, India needs energy, be it solar energy, wind energy or any other form of energy.

“Our national goals are ambitious and clear: 50% of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals. Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy, but it is at the heart of it and the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat,” said the minister.

Underlining the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Joshi said, “ PM Shri Narendra Modi gave us a vision to have ‘renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption’.”

India’s manufacturing capacity is increasing, and it will continue to increase. In view of this, Hon. PM’s vision stresses upon the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub shortly, it should be able to fulfil the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources, said the minister.

India has huge potential in the renewable energy sector as it has globally the fourth largest wind power installed capacity, and it isthe third largest renewable energy producer. “No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality, said the minister.

The minister underlined the 3 key issues for the Wind Energy sector, saying:

“First, we must combine wind with solar and storage (BESS) to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability.

Second, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of ₹3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs.

Third, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports.”

Underlining the dedicated efforts from GoI to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, Shri Joshi said, “The Government is backing this sector with full seriousness. This year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53%, to ₹26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.”

“The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,” the minister added.

The Minister said, “ I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.”

The Minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, we need a coordinated national push. That is why we are focusing on 5 priorities:

Expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha.

Launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and tenders being readied.

Integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models.

Modernising the grid, investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy.

Boosting local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain

Union Minister Joshi also released reports on Wind Energy Roadmap and Manufacturing Roadmap at the event. He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Aatmanirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India. Best performing States in terms of Wind Capacity addition were also felicitated at the event. Karnataka was first with a wind capacity addition of 1331.48 MW followed by Tamil Nadu (1136.37 MW) and Gujarat (954.76 MW)",https://hindudayashankar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1TV5F.jpeg,N,,2025-06-15 14:05:30.811572

Backyard projects on a budget Estimated cost: $1,000 to $6,900 If you’re a business owner, these backyard ideas may be perfect for you.","Ever dream of having the “perfect” backyard space? You’re not alone. According to a recent survey by data collection firm Talker Research, more than 40% of American homeowners plan to create a “backyard sanctuary” in 2025.*

However, the estimated average cost of completing their “dream exteriors” was $13,321. While substantial, this amount typically can’t buy you something lavish, like an inground pool, which may cost around $30,000 to $60,000.

So, how can you make your dream backyard a reality and stretch your dollar further? Well, one solution may come from a seemingly unlikely source: Federal taxes.

Using an estimated budget of $13,321, Kiplinger compiled a list of projects that may fit your summer backyard while allowing certain tax benefits that could make these ideas more affordable. Here they are.

*The survey was commissioned by Trex and administered online to 2,000 American homeowners.

Backyard ideas for summer

Kiplinger used sample home projects from key federal tax laws to create the list of summer backyard ideas. Estimated costs were sourced through HomeGuide’s estimator tool in June 2025.

Yet it’s important to note that current material prices, tariff impacts, scope of work, and other factors can impact the cost of a home project. Consequently, price estimates are ever-changing. Consult with your contractor first before deciding whether a project is right for you and your budget.

*Note: The tax policy mentioned in this article pertains to federal taxes only. Check your state’s Department of Revenue website to see if you might be eligible for a state-level tax break.

Backyard renovation ideas: 2025

Estimated cost: $500 to $12,600

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the IRS offers a slew of federal tax incentives for energy efficiency in your outdoor area. These energy-efficient projects are just one way you can renovate your backyard this summer on a budget. For example:

Your backyard door may qualify for a tax credit of up to $250. (The average exterior door costs between $500 and $1,900.)

Central air conditioners, typically installed in the back or side yards, may qualify for up to $600 off the installation costs. (A new central HVAC system generally costs a minimum of $7,000.)

Solar panels can qualify for up to 30% off the installation costs. (Solar panels are generally priced at least $12,600 after the tax credit.)

These project ideas may not only save you on taxes, but also liven up your home’s summer landscape and cut your monthly energy bill.

However, if you're planning to take advantage of tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, you might want to call your contractor soon.

The GOP’s latest proposal, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” includes a slew of tax provisions that could cut many ""clean energy"" tax incentives, including those for energy-efficient home improvements. This is why some homeowners are rushing to install solar panels before Trump cuts tax credits.

But for now, none of the above tax breaks are gone. So if you start planning your project in the summer, you could finish before any potential changes to federal tax policy are made.

Backyard ideas to increase home value

Estimated cost: $2,000 to $12,000

If you’re looking to sell your home in the future, you might be wondering what backyard summer projects could add the most “value” to your property.

Well, here are a few value-added backyard ideas to get you started:

Installing a snazzy new patio or deck, which may cost between $2,000 and $10,000, assuming 10-foot by 20-foot dimensions.

Adding a fence for Fido or to make backyard barbecues more private. The average cost of fencing your yard can be $4,000 to $12,000, assuming a 200-foot straight fence.

Although these so-called “capital improvements” can be a bit pricier than other projects on this list, they can add value to your home, thus increasing your home’s tax basis. This could, in turn, affect your capital gains tax on the sale of your home.

For example:

If you purchased a home for $200,000 and later sold the house for $500,000, part of your $300,000 difference could be subject to capital gains tax.

But if you can prove $50,000 of home upgrades, your home’s tax basis would be $250,000. The difference between the selling price of $500,000 and the new tax basis of $250,000 is less than before and may not be taxed.

This capital gains exclusion could prevent you from paying capital gains taxes on your home sale, while simultaneously leading to a higher selling price for your house (giving you more money).

However, you may want to look out for property taxes, which might increase as your home’s value rises. While this wouldn’t affect short-term move-out dates, it might affect you if you live in your home for longer than a year.

In particular, studies have shown that 75% of adults over age 50 want to age in place. But if you do live with someone who needs a medically necessary home improvement, you might qualify for the medical expense tax deduction on your federal return.

For more information, check out Kiplinger’s report, Tax-Deductible Home Improvements for Retirement in 2025.

Backyard projects on a budget

Estimated cost: $1,000 to $6,900

If you’re a business owner, these backyard ideas may be perfect for you. The IRS allows a home office tax deduction for qualified business expenses incurred to set up or maintain a business. This includes independent contracting, freelancing, and other self-employed work.

So if you use your backyard for a business purpose, the following projects may qualify for a federal tax deduction:

Permanent storage sheds used to store business equipment and materials. A shed costs, on average, at least $1,000 (assuming 10 feet by 10 feet dimensions).

Pathway or driveway improvements may be partially tax-deductible (if they are used for business purposes, like when your clients visit your office). The cost of a new concrete 2-car driveway can be around $1,700 to $6,900.

But before you claim a business expense or home office tax deduction, be sure you meet the strict guidelines.

For instance, home office deductions typically require that you use the area regularly and exclusively for business, while most business expense deductions need you to prove the expense is for the “ordinary and necessary” operations of your business.

There are other requirements you must meet, including careful documentation of the improvements, so make sure you can claim the deduction before filing your federal return. To that effect, you may want to consult with your qualified tax professional before breaking ground on your new project.

Offshore wind projects in the United States have the potential to create over 770,000 jobs by 2030 and generate enough energy to power up to six million homes.

Despite declaring an “energy emergency”, the Trump Administration has launched multiple attacks on the wind industry, including pausing permitting on all wind projects. In April, the Department of Interior ordered the Empire Wind Project to stop all development, putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The Sierra Club, other environmental organizations, and elected officials continued to push back until the Department of Interior lifted its stop-work order.

In response, Sierra Club Senior Advisor for Offshore Wind issued the following statement:

“Americans are ready to move beyond toxic, expensive fossil fuels, and embrace cheaper, cleaner energy from offshore wind. Offshore wind is the key to achieving U.S. energy dominance–it’s a powerhouse for our economy that will create thousands of stable, well-paying jobs from coast to coast. Today, we are urging Americans to say YES to offshore wind and the opportunities these projects will bring to our communities.”

Allyson Samuell, Sierra Club New York Senior Campaign Organizer added:

“On Friday, I stood outside Ravenswood Generating Station in Queens, New York, the largest power plant in NYC, to celebrate Global Wind Day and urge New York State to continue investing in the infrastructure that will help us finally transition away from fossil fuels. In the near future our goal is to plug offshore wind into the NYC grid where this aging gas infrastructure currently stands. With the massive smoke stacks towering over us, New Yorkers imagined a future where our communities no longer suffered from increased asthma rates as a result of the pollution. We were joined by the owners of the power plant, Rise Light and Power, along with various other advocates and members of the community who’ve fought for this transition for decades. With offshore wind online, we can make this vision a reality.”

Julia Dowell, Sierra Club California Senior Campaign Organizer added:

“Despite federal opposition, California is standing strong on offshore wind. Offshore wind is widely popular, and it’s a critical piece of the puzzle to reaching the state’s 100% clean energy goals and retiring the more than 160 gas plants across the state. Ensuring that offshore wind energy gets built out and delivered to communities currently relying on polluting gas plants is key to delivering much-needed green jobs and healthy air.”

Mariah Shriner, Sierra Club Maryland Climate Campaign Representative added:

""Offshore wind energy is a critical resource that will help Maryland reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change. By moving away from reliance on dirty fossil fuel energy and expanding renewable energy resources, Marylanders will be able to breathe cleaner air and benefit from new clean energy jobs.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-15 11:04:35.467486

HEV sales continue to increase in Australia, with 17,089 sold in May 2025, mostly Toyotas.
Australia has two main transport highways from Brisbane to Sydney — the Pacific and the New England Highways.","The overall Australian auto market continues to be buoyant, with 109,425 light vehicles sold in May 2025. Of this number, 12% had plugs. A total of 10,065 battery electric cars (BEV) were sold (9.2% of the market) and 3,081 plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) were sold (2.8% of the market). In the first five months of 2025, 33,976 EVs have been delivered, compared to 40,966 in the first five months of 2024. It is hoped that the resurgence of Model Y deliveries, coupled with the continuous launch of new EV models, will make up the difference in the months to come.

In a recent report from Rho Motion on global plugin electric vehicle take-up, at the bottom of the list, we find “Rest of the World” (ROW). 600,000 plugin vehicles sold in ROW in May. This is presented as a 36% growth year on year. Australia is proud to be part of that. Although, our growth rate is lagging others in this category. According to Rho Motion, global EV sales are growing at almost 30% a year. That should mean an annual sales figure for 2025 in excess of 23 million units.

PHEV sales in Australia have been influenced by two major government policies. In April, sales were up as businesses seized the window of opportunity to avoid Fringe Benefits Tax. 6,932 PHEVs were sold in April. In May, that number was reduced to 3,081. Most of these were BYD’s Shark 6 and Sealion 6. However, with the impending “new vehicle efficiency standard (NVES), these plug-in hybrids are crucial for commercial vehicle-heavy carmakers to lower cumulative CO2 emissions. In Ford’s case, the Ranger plug-in hybrid will need to do a lot of heavy lifting — so it better be successful.” More on that later.

The ten best sellers on the BEV market in May 2025 were … (drum roll):

Tesla Model Y — 3,580 | year to date — 6,974

Kia EV5 — 703 | year to date — 2,212

Geely EX5 — 511 | year to date — 1,023

BYD Sealion 7 — 488 | year to date — 1,961

BYD Seal — 355 | year to date — 982

BYD Dolphin — 345 | year to date — 776

BYD Atto 3 — 322 | year to date — 1,278

MG MG4 — 319 | year to date — 2,017

Tesla Model 3 — 317

Kia EV3 — 310 | year to date — 832

The ship has certainly and literally come in for the Model Y — up from only 280 sales in April. Half of the 2025 Model Y sales were delivered in May! It is worth noting that two of the top 5 have only recently been released to the market — the Kia EV 5 and the Geely EX 5. Just off the chart are the MGS5 with 106 sales and the Hyundai Inster with 101 sales. We had a chance to check out the Inster and are looking forward to spending some time with the new MGS5 and the Deepal SO 7. There is still no data coming through about sales of the Xpeng G6, but we have been seeing them on the roads for the past few months.

Professor Ray Wills of the University of Western Australia commented on X recently that “Australian electric vehicle sales have completed the groundwork for the step change to double-digit share of sales. ICE vehicles share of sales continues to decline. Australia and the rest of the world that’s not the US will see cheaper EVs arriving by year’s end, and then greater surges in 2026 as China’s production continues to ramp, and Europe makes deals with China for manufacturing in Europe,” he predicts. He shared some very revealing graphs to back up his assertions.

HEV sales continue to increase in Australia, with 17,089 sold in May 2025, mostly Toyotas. As Toyota pivots to battery-electric cars in China, I would expect that those vehicles will be exported to Australia and further supercharge the BEV take-up. In May 2025, Toyota sold 371 BZ4X and Subaru sold 111 Solterra — just a little piggy toehold in the market.

With the massive surge of the Tesla Model Y (3,580), it is no surprise that the electric SUV came fourth overall in the Australian market, behind the Toyota Hilux (4,952), Ford Ranger (4,761), and Toyota RAV4 (4,003). Aussies love their utes. Plenty of market there for the Cybertruck to disrupt! The BYD PHEV Shark continues to nibble, with 1,300 sales in May. We are seeing them on the roads more and more often, and even charged next to one on our recent trip to the Waterfall Way — stay tuned for an article on this.

Great Wall Motors is launching a PHEV ute with 115 km of range to challenge the Shark’s current dominance. The GWM Canon Alpha is being compared positively to the PHEV Ranger. Next to China’s offerings, the Ford Ranger PHEV effort looks pretty pathetic — less range, worse specs, and much higher price. Let the battle begin.

Apparently, Ford’s “most senior global product executive has declared the decision to prioritise towing and payload specs for the Ranger PHEV to be the correct one, with the Detroit-based Jim Baumbick telling Chasing Cars that outright electric range and system power are lower in the priority order.”

In summary, the BYD Shark 06 has an electric range of approximately 100 km at a cost of AU$58,000; the GWM Canon Alpha has 110 km of range and costs AU$64,000; and the Ford Ranger PHEV costs AU$72,000 with 49 km range. I believe that the range estimates are generous. The Ford warranty period is only 5 years less than the warranty for the Shark and the GWM Canon. For a more detailed analysis, see here. Or, watch the video here. Now we await the verdict of the buying public.

Speculation continues about the availability of the Tesla Cybertruck Down Under. Recent comments by Thom Drew, Country Director for Tesla Australia, suggest that a debut is close. The Cybertruck has been on a tour of Australian cities over the past twelve months. The public are certainly primed to buy.

In order to sell the Cybertruck in Australia, Tesla must meet the Australian Design Rules. The verdict is that there would not need to be many modifications. “There are small changes to bumper widths, some external lighting requirements, and obviously left to right-hand drive, and just a few engineering changes like that, but fundamentally it’d be the same vehicle.” The Cybertruck would then be priced an extra AU$5,000 to AU$10,000.

And, just to finish off — are there enough chargers to meet the needs of all these electric vehicles that will be swarming on Australian roads? The answer is yes — charging is being built out at a phenomenal rate. I will offer two examples. Australia’s largest hardware chain, Bunnings, is installing EV chargers at their stores (they have hundreds). So far, 14 have been installed.

Australia has two main transport highways from Brisbane to Sydney — the Pacific and the New England Highways. The Pacific Highway has plenty of public high-speed chargers. Until recently, it was more problematic to drive and charge an EV down the New England Highway. On our recent trip from Brisbane to the Waterfall Way, we were amazed at the change. High-speed chargers were abundant, and more were being built.

Next spring, forklifts will rip up the last ICE conveyor, and by late 2026 the same plant will stamp, paint, and bolt together battery packs for the all-electric Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV. General Motors is dropping $4 billion into the makeover, its single biggest outlay for a U.S. factory since the Saturn era.

Cash, concrete, and a longer extension cord

GM first floated the Orion conversion in January 2022, bundling it with a new Ultium battery plant in Lansing. Then the chip shortage hit, EV demand cooled, and executives tapped the brakes. On 11 June 2025, CEO Mary Barra stamped the project back to full speed: the same $4 billion, the same target, just two years later than planned.

State records show $600 million in Michigan tax abatements and grants greasing the skids. In return, Orion Township expects 1,500 fresh union jobs and a 2.2-million-square-foot expansion that includes a battery-module clean room bigger than four football fields.

The site sits forty miles from GM’s new Ultium Cells battery plant in Delta Township, trimming transport costs for 2,000-pound packs. Skilled labor is already on tap: Orion workers built the all-electric Chevy Bolt for seven years, so they know high-voltage safety inside out. And Michigan’s Renaissance Zone tax breaks make land nearly as cheap as Tennessee or Texas, places Midwest carmakers once feared.

Two trucks will roll off the line: the Chevy Silverado EV WT: which will be $54,000 base before credits, with a 450-mile range and 10,000-pound tow rating. Then we have the GMC Sierra EV Denali, all leather-lined, a four-wheel-steer luxury bruiser north of $95K.

GM’s investor deck pegs joint Orion + Factory ZERO output at 600,000 electric pickups a year by 2028—roughly half Ford’s total F-Series volume today.

Hard numbers behind the bet

$4 billion cap-ex for Orion alone, part of GM’s $35 billion EV war chest

600 k EV pickups a year when Orion and Factory ZERO hit stride

70 % lower assembly-line CO₂ per truck versus gas models, thanks to onsite solar plus a 50 MW wind PPA

$600 million in Michigan incentives wrapped into the deal

The bigger roadmap: 2 million EVs, coast to coast

Orion’s truck surge feeds GM’s plan to sell two million EVs a year in the U.S. by 2030. Cadillac turns all-electric by decade’s end; Buick follows by 2035. Ultium battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan will crank 150 GWh annually, enough cells for every bolt, Bolt, and luxury barge coming down GM’s pipe.

Still, challenges lurk. Lithium and nickel prices swing like crypto. Fast-charging corridors lag outside coastal metros. Federal tax-credit rules may shift after the 2026 election. GM’s brass counters with scale: once Orion and Delta Township hit volume, every one-percent drop in battery cost saves the company $85 million a year.

What drivers can expect

Early Silverado EV work-truck trims go on sale this fall at roughly $54,000 before incentives, squarely in Ford F-150 Lightning territory but with 50 extra miles of range. Sierra EV Denalis will carry eye-watering stickers—but so do gas Denalis. Either way, the horsepower wars have moved from octane ratings to kilowatt-hours, and Orion’s new floor space is the staging ground.

Farewell fumes, hello electrons

When Orion cranked its first Sonics in 2011, gas cost $3.70 and Chevy’s “extended-range” Volt was the weird kid in the lot. Fourteen years on, the factory’s next chapter trades fuel pumps for battery chillers and tailpipes for CCS charge ports. It’s not the absolute end of fossil fuels (millions of V-8s will still thunder down American roads) but it is a defining pivot.

The plant by the lake has thrown the switch. The next time its doors roll up, semis won’t be hauling oil-soaked engine blocks; they’ll be delivering pallets of lithium cells ready to power the silent heavyweights of GM’s electric future.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/general-motors-headquarters.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 12:12:04.378300

“My GA Power bill in Nov 2022 was $159,” Mr. Gantt posted on X last fall, attaching screenshots. “My bill now is $615 plus. Robbery.”

He got a response from Tim Echols, a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities. Suspecting a malfunctioning air-conditioner, Mr. Echols asked Mr. Gantt for more details.

Actually, Mr. Gantt replied, his air-conditioner was new. The only explanation for his “obscene” bills, he told Mr. Echols, was a series of rate increases that the commission had approved, despite “people begging you to not raise rates.”

Mr. Gantt will have a chance to amplify his voice on Tuesday, when Mr. Echols will compete in a special primary election. It will be the first time in five years that any of the commission’s five members have faced voters.

Georgia is one of 10 states with elected, rather than appointed, utility regulators, who play a key role in energy and climate policy. So this week’s primary and the general election in November, when Mr. Echols’s seat and another will be up for grabs, will be a rare referendum on residential electric bills, at a time when prices have risen sharply across the country.

The obscure but powerful commission, whose members are all Republican, has approved six rate increases over the last two years. Residential customers of Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, have seen their bills rise by $518 a year, or 33 percent, on average.

Factoring in natural gas, water and internet costs, Georgia residents now pay among the highest utility bills in the country, trailing only Alaska, Hawaii, Connecticut and West Virginia.

The races for the commission seats will be the only ones on the statewide ballot in November. Whether the energy bills will raise turnout for what have historically been low-profile elections is a big question. But three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills, according to a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by PowerLines, an advocacy group focused on reducing power bills.

Energy costs rose sharply around the country in 2022, driven by a spike in natural gas prices when Russia invaded Ukraine. In Georgia, additional factors in the state’s high utility bills include $17 billion in cost overruns from Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle nuclear generators and new infrastructure to support an anticipated surge in electricity demand from data centers.

President Trump’s domestic policy bill could further inflate prices by ending federal tax credits for low-carbon sources of electricity like wind and solar power, companies and researchers say.

In South Carolina and Florida, some Republican legislators have become more vocal in challenging energy companies that are hungry to build new natural gas power plants and pipelines to accommodate more data centers.

The energy companies have also faced tough questions in Georgia. State Senator Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican who chairs his chamber’s finance committee, sought to create a watchdog office that could represent consumers in court cases against utility companies. He also wanted data centers that do business in Georgia to pay the additional costs of serving them. But Republican leaders blocked both bills.

“It’s the one area we’ve got to work on to maintain our competitive advantage,” Mr. Hufstetler said of electricity costs. The Georgia Public Service Commission, he added, “has given Georgia Power 99 percent of what they asked for.”

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, announced last month that Georgia Power had reached a deal with the commission to freeze base rates for three years. “This rate freeze will help Georgia families in the time they need it most,” he said.

No Democrat has served on the commission since 2007. Commissioners serve staggered six-year terms and must live in specific districts, even though the elections are statewide. Their annual salary in fiscal year 2024 was a little over $128,000.

A federal lawsuit in 2020 argued that the statewide elections for commission seats were unfair to Black voters. That prompted the cancellation of elections for members in 2022 and 2024. But an appeals court ruled against the plaintiffs, allowing the elections this year to proceed.

Mr. Echols, who lives outside Athens, frequently roams the state to talk about economic development and electric vehicles. He also hosts a podcast on energy and sustainability. “I love this job,” he said in an interview.

His Republican primary challenger is Lee Muns, a businessman from the Augusta area who has expressed concern about a growing number of people whose power has been cut off after they fell behind on bills.

Whoever wins the Republican primary on Tuesday will face Alicia Johnson, a health management and community development executive from Savannah, in the general election in November. She said she was alarmed by the commission’s approval of Georgia Power’s robust return on investment, which is well above the industry average.

“We want them to make profit, but not at the expense of rural underserved communities who are already trying to eke out a living,” said Dr. Johnson, a Democrat.

The struggle to pay energy bills could become more difficult if President Trump follows through with a plan to eliminate a $4 billion federal program that helps low-income households pay their electricity bills. Nancy Thompkins, 65, of Savannah, recently sought and received an emergency grant of $500 from the program to help pay off her Georgia Power bills. “It’s a blessing,” she said of the program.

The other incumbent on the commission, Fitz Johnson (no relation to Alicia), is a former defense contractor and candidate for state superintendent of schools. He identified his top priorities as stabilizing costs for ratepayers, as well as grid reliability and safety.

Three Democrats are vying in Tuesday’s primary to take on Mr. Johnson in November: Keisha Waites, Robert Jones and Peter Hubbard. (A fourth was disqualified.)

Ms. Waites, a former State Representative and Atlanta City Council member, said she would focus on oversight so that the commission “actually is a watchdog for consumers.”

Mr. Jones, a former state regulator and Microsoft executive, said commissioners should stop accepting contributions from utility lawyers and consultants — the people whose work they are supposed to regulate.

Mr. Hubbard, a clean energy consultant, said that Georgia Power was relying on exaggerated forecasts of future electricity demands to justify using more fossil fuel-powered generation to accommodate data centers. “Who’s going to be left holding the bag?” he said. “It’s going to be the ratepayer.”

A Georgia Power spokesman, John Kraft, said the company had a “relentless focus on affordability for customers.” He said that since 1990, the company’s rates for retail businesses had been 15 percent below the national average.

Despite soaring demand, cable manufacturers remain cautious about expanding capacity, raising questions about whether the pace of electrification can keep up with climate ambitions, geopolitical tensions, and the practical realities of industrial investment.

The expertise, technology, and infrastructure required to make high-voltage cables are concentrated in a handful of companies, creating what analysts describe as a ""deep moat"" that is difficult for new entrants to cross.","In a nutshell: As nations set ever more ambitious targets for renewable energy and electrification, the humble high-voltage cable has emerged as a linchpin – and a potential chokepoint – in the race to decarbonize the global economy. A Bloomberg interview with Claes Westerlind, CEO of NKT, a leading cable manufacturer based in Denmark, explains why.

A global surge in demand for high-voltage electricity cables is threatening to stall the clean energy revolution, as the world's ability to build new wind farms, solar plants, and cross-border power links increasingly hinges on a supply chain bottleneck few outside the industry have considered. At the center of this challenge is the complex, capital-intensive process of manufacturing the giant cables that transport electricity across hundreds of miles, both over land and under the sea.

Despite soaring demand, cable manufacturers remain cautious about expanding capacity, raising questions about whether the pace of electrification can keep up with climate ambitions, geopolitical tensions, and the practical realities of industrial investment.

High-voltage cables are the arteries of modern power grids, carrying electrons from remote wind farms or hydroelectric dams to the cities and industries that need them. Unlike the thin wires that run through a home's walls, these cables are engineering marvels – sometimes as thick as a person's torso, armored to withstand the crushing pressure of the ocean floor, and designed to last for decades under extreme electrical and environmental stress.

""If you look at the very high voltage direct current cable, able to carry roughly two gigawatts through two pairs of cables – that means that the equivalent of one nuclear power reactor is flowing through one cable,"" Westerlind told Bloomberg.

The process of making these cables is as specialized as it is demanding. At the core is a conductor, typically made of copper or aluminum, twisted together like a rope for flexibility and strength. Around this, manufacturers apply multiple layers of insulation in towering vertical factories to ensure the cable remains perfectly round and can safely contain the immense voltages involved. Any impurity in the insulation, even something as small as an eyelash, can cause catastrophic failure, potentially knocking out power to entire cities.

As the world rushes to harness new sources of renewable energy, the demand for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables has skyrocketed. HVDC technology, initially pioneered by NKT in the 1950s, has become the backbone of long-distance power transmission, particularly for offshore wind farms and intercontinental links. In recent years, approximately 80 to 90 percent of new large-scale cable projects have utilized HVDC, reflecting its efficiency in transmitting electricity over vast distances with minimal losses.

But this surge in demand has led to a critical bottleneck. Factories that produce these cables are booked out for years, Westerlind reports, and every project requires custom engineering to match the power needs, geography, and environmental conditions of its route. According to the International Energy Agency, meeting global clean energy goals will require building the equivalent of 80 million kilometers (around 49.7 million miles) of new grid infrastructure by 2040 – essentially doubling what has been constructed over the past century, but in just 15 years.

Despite the clear need, cable makers have been slow to add capacity due to reasons that are as much economic and political as technical. Building a new cable factory can cost upwards of a billion euros, and manufacturers are wary of making such investments without long-term commitments from utilities or governments. ""For a company like us to do investments in the realm of €1 or 2 billion, it's a massive commitment... but it's also a massive amount of demand that is needed for this investment to actually make financial sense over the next not five years, not 10 years, but over the next 20 to 30 years,"" Westerlind said. The industry still bears scars from a decade ago, when anticipated demand failed to materialize and expensive new facilities sat underused.

Some governments and transmission system operators are trying to break the logjam by making ""anticipatory investments"" – committing to buy cable capacity even before specific projects are finalized. This approach, backed by regulators, gives manufacturers the confidence to expand, but it remains the exception rather than the rule.

Meanwhile, the industry's structure itself creates barriers to rapid expansion, according to Westerlind. The expertise, technology, and infrastructure required to make high-voltage cables are concentrated in a handful of companies, creating what analysts describe as a ""deep moat"" that is difficult for new entrants to cross.

Geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity. China has built more HVDC lines than any other country, although Western manufacturers, such as NKT, maintain a technical edge in the most advanced cable systems. Still, there is growing concern in Europe and the US about becoming dependent on foreign suppliers for such critical infrastructure, especially in light of recent global conflicts and trade disputes. ""Strategic autonomy is very important when it comes to the core parts and the fundamental parts of your society, where the grid backbone is one,"" Westerlind noted.

The stakes are high. Without a rapid and coordinated push to expand cable manufacturing, the world's clean energy transition could be slowed not by a lack of wind or sun but by a shortage of the cables needed to connect them to the grid. As Westerlind put it, ""We all know it has to be done... These are large investments. They are very expensive investments. So also the governments have to have a part in enabling these anticipatory investments, and making it possible for the TSOs to actually carry forward with them.""",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/06/2025-06-14-image-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 11:04:39.857026

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Shripad Yesso Naik and the Energy Minister in Government of Karnataka Shri K.G. George was also present on this occasion. Pralhad Joshi said that in order to become a global manufacturing hub, India needs energy; be it solar energy, wind energy or any other form of energy.

“Our national goals are ambitious and clear: 50% of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals. Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy but it is at the heart of it and at the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat,” said the minister.

Underlining the vision of Hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Joshi said, “ Hon. PM Shri Narendra Modi gave us a vision to have ‘renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption’.”

India’s manufacturing capacity is increasing and it will continue to increase. In view of this, Hon. PM’s vision stresses upon the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub in near future, it should be able to fulfill the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources, said the minister.

India has the huge potential in the renewable energy sector as it has globally the fourth largest wind power installed capacity and it is third largest renewable energy producer. “No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality, said the minister.

The minister underlined the 3 key issues for the Wind Energy sector saying:

“First, we must combine wind with solar and storage (BESS) to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability.

Second, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of ₹3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs.

Third, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports.”

Underlining the dedicated efforts from GoI to unleash the potential of renewable energy sector, Shri Joshi said, “The Government is backing this sector with full seriousness. This year’s renewable energy budget has gone up by 53%, to ₹26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.”

“The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,” the minister added.

The Minister said, “ I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.”

The Minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, we need a coordinated national push. That is why we are focusing on 5 priorities:

Expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh,Telangana, and Odisha.

Launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and tenders being readied.

Integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models.

Modernising the grid, investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy.

Boosting local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain

Union Minister Joshi also released reports on Wind Energy Roadmap and Manufacturing Roadmap at the event. He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Aatmanirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India.

That's why NPR is dedicating a week to stories about solutions for building and living on a hotter planet.

VIENNA — At the edge of a wide, grassy park in Vienna, there's a modern building with lots of windows and a sleek wood facade. For the past six years, Sebastian Schublach has lived here with his family in a light-filled four-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor.

Up on the roof, where Schublach can relax in the communal library with a view of the city and park, there are solar panels to reduce climate pollution. There's a rooftop garden full of rosemary — the greenery helps keep the building cool in summer. Thick, insulated walls reduce the need for heating and cooling — Schublach's apartment doesn't even need an air conditioner. ""It's not cold in winter times. It's not hot in summer times,"" Schublach says. ""It's very comfortable.""

In the United States, high-quality, climate-friendly apartments like this are mostly rare and unaffordable, says Daniel Aldana Cohen, professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley and co-director of the think tank the Climate and Community Institute. But in Vienna, sustainable buildings like Schublach's aren't just affordable, they're widespread. Schublach's apartment is what the Viennese call ""social housing"" — housing that's built or supported by the government. Now this social housing is a key driver of Vienna's ambitious climate action.

About half of Vienna's 2 million residents live in social housing. Average social housing rents are about $700 for a large one-bedroom apartment, says Gerald Kössl, researcher at the Austrian Federation of Limited-Profit Housing Associations. Schublach pays more for his four-bedroom — with utilities, it's around $1,700 per month. ""Which is not 'cheap, cheap,' but it's definitely affordable,"" he says.

In the U.S., the number of households officially ""burdened by rent"" has hit another record high. As of 2023, more than 22 million renting households are spending more than 30% of their incomes on rent and utilities, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Meanwhile, climate change-fueled wildfires, floods, heat waves and sea-level rise are making it harder to find safe, affordable dwellings. And the energy used to heat and cool the nation's housing stock contributes to climate pollution.

The lack of affordable housing and the growing threat of global warming used to be thought of as two distinct problems. Now that's changing, and politicians in U.S. cities like Chicago and Denver are looking to tackle the housing crisis while simultaneously combating climate change. They see Vienna's green social housing as a roadmap.

Vienna council member Nina Abrahamczik, who heads the climate and environment committee, says as the city transitions all of its buildings off planet-heating fossil fuels, they're starting with the roughly 420,000 housing units they already own or subsidize. ""If you have these buildings, you can make choices regarding those buildings, "" Abrahamczik says. "" One of the biggest advantages is that we have a bigger lever.""

Using social housing as a lever for climate goals

Just like the United States, the federal government of Austria has recently been backtracking on climate action. But Vienna is forging ahead. This spring the Austrian capital passed a historic climate law, outlining a plan to get its climate pollution down to zero by 2040. Vienna's leaders see the city's vast social housing program as a critical tool.

Vienna has two main types of social housing: city-owned and city-subsidized. Vienna owns and operates about 220,000 apartment units. Some date back to the period from 1919 to 1934 when, amid a postwar housing crisis, the newly elected left-wing Social Democratic Party built more than 60,000 brand-new, high-quality apartments for its citizens, says Eve Blau, architecture and urban history professor at Harvard. Today the city also subsidizes about 200,000 apartment units.

As Vienna makes an aggressive push to completely move away from climate-polluting natural gas by 2040, it's starting with much of this social housing, says Jürgen Czernohorszky, executive city councilor responsible for climate and environment. City-owned buildings are now switching from gas to massive electric heat pumps, and to geothermal, which involves probing into the ground to heat homes. Another massive geothermal project that drills even deeper into the earth to heat homes is also underway.

The city is also powering housing with solar energy. As of a year and a half ago, Vienna mandates all new buildings and building extensions to have rooftop solar. And Vienna's older apartment buildings are getting climate retrofits, says Veronika Iwanowski, spokesperson for Vienna's municipal housing company, Wiener Wohnen. That includes new insulation, doors and windows to prevent the city's wind from getting in the cracks.

The increase in energy efficiency and switching from gas to renewables doesn't just have climate benefits from cutting fossil fuel use. It also means housing residents are paying less on electric bills, Czernohorszky says. ""The sun,"" he says, ""doesn't send an energy bill.""

To spur climate-friendly designs, Vienna makes competitions

Schublach's light-filled building, Gleis 21, is a type of housing subsidized by the city. And it's an example, researchers say, of how Vienna uses subsidized housing to drive innovative climate design.

With city-subsidized housing, housing developers can compete to get land and low-interest loans from the city. Officials say those competitions are a critical lever for climate action. ""As we can control the contents of the competitions, we try to make them fit to the main goals of the city,"" says Kurt Hofstetter, city planner for Vienna, ""which is of course also ecological.""

When developers compete, they submit proposals to a panel of expert judges who award them points for the features the buildings will have. When the competitions began in the 1990s, judges awarded points for things like beautiful architecture and keeping costs low. But in the late 2000s, the city also started to prioritize climate-friendly designs, says Wolfgang Förster, director of Vienna-based housing consultancy PUSH Consulting, and a former head of housing research for the city. Now the housing judges give out points for things like increased energy efficiency, green roofs and sustainable building materials.

The land that's now Schublach's apartment had been an old rail yard. Around a decade ago when Vienna was turning the land into housing, the competition was fierce. A group of about 20 friends and acquaintances wanted to make an apartment together, and they had their eyes on a plot at the edge of the park. The group chose an architect, Markus Zilker, who along with his team made a design full of climate-friendly features, including lots of insulation and sustainable building materials. The architects also completed an analysis of the full life cycle of the greenhouse gas emissions of the building materials. Zilker remains convinced that the climate elements of Gleis 21's proposal were what helped them beat the competition.

Climate-friendly designs are increasingly rewarded with points in competitions, leading to more and more green social housing, Zilker says. Now the climate innovations in subsidized housing are inspiring the private market as well, Hofstetter says. ""The subsidized housing has such high quality,"" Hofstetter says, ""because we always are pushing it to the limits.""

Social housing fits into the city's broader climate adaptation plan

In 2003, about 180 people died of heat stress in Vienna as heat waves swept through Europe. As the world heats up, Europe is warming up twice as fast as the global average, according to Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization.

Vienna isn't just working to reduce climate pollution, it's also building new infrastructure to help adapt to global warming. Hofstetter says social housing is intricately tied into these new plans.

On an old airfield with a large lake, Vienna is building a new social housing development with a special emphasis on decreasing risks from climate change, like heat and flooding. This development, called Seestadt, has a mix of city-built housing and city-subsidized housing.

Hofstetter, a landscaper by training who helped design Seestadt, says the development has elements of something called a ""sponge city."" On a street near some social housing, Hofstetter points to a sunken planter full of gravel, sand and the beginnings of daffodils. It's about the size of the bed of a flatbed truck. It turns out the sunken planter helps prevent floods.

""You can see here, this is where the water comes in when it's really a lot,"" he says.

In intense rainstorms, instead of massive amounts of rainwater all rushing into the sewer at once, the sunken planters can absorb excess stormwater so it doesn't overpower the sewer system. With permeable landscaping like this, he says, "" the sewer system can be much smaller.""

For Hofstetter, the climate resiliency of green social housing isn't just about the housing itself — it's also about everything that surrounds it. ""Sponge city"" landscaping helps protect residents from floods. The trees cool residents down in heat waves. The bike lanes and car-free streets reduce climate and noise pollution and keep children safe.

""The idea of creating spaces and areas for people to live in a dignified way — that's the main focus,"" Hofstetter says.

As the U.S. federal government pulls back, local governments take the lead

In the U.S. today, much of the public housing and subsidized affordable housing has a connection to the federal government. Some of it was funded or built by the federal government or with some combination of federal tax credits and money from other sources.

Under the Biden administration, the U.S. federal government tried to tackle climate pollution through federally assisted housing with a $1 billion program to make older housing more energy efficient and climate resilient. Now that President Trump has returned to office his administration has taken steps to eliminate the program, although it's still unclear what will happen to it. Many other federally funded housing assistance programs are also on the chopping block.

Last September Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. introduced the Homes Act, which would support the construction of climate-friendly affordable housing. Smith tells NPR she was inspired to learn more about social housing after visiting Vienna, and from her work on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. But the legislation remains stalled in Congress.

While federal efforts for green social housing have slowed, there's momentum on the local level, says Ruthy Gourevitch, housing and communities director at the Climate and Community Institute, which just released a new report on lessons from Viennese green social housing for the U.S.

Gourevitch says that, like Vienna, America's green social housing doesn't have to rely on federal funding. Some money to finance Vienna's social housing comes from a tax on people's salaries — the employee pays part and the employer pays part, Kössl says. Most of the city's funding is provided in the form of low-interest loans, he adds. And in city-subsidized housing, also called ""limited profit"" housing, developers must invest profits back into maintaining housing or building more housing.

U.S. cities are also finding local funds to build green housing. Chicago is using $135 million of a larger city bond as a ""seed fund"" for climate-friendly affordable housing. A new ""Green Social Housing"" ordinance passed this spring creates a nonprofit that will administer the funds and have an ownership stake in the development of new apartment buildings. The plan is for 30% of the apartments to be affordable and for the buildings to reduce energy use and climate pollution.

This new housing, as well as retrofits of old housing, could play an important role in Chicago's goal of reducing emissions 62% in the next 15 years, says Jung Yoon, chief of policy for the Chicago mayor's office. She notes that around 70% of Chicago's emissions come from buildings. ""We can't reduce emissions without building much more sustainable housing,"" Yoon says. ""These things are intricately tied together.""

While climate investments can sometimes have high up-front costs, local governments are realizing that making housing more resilient to heat, flooding and storms could pay off as the world warms, says Sara McTarnaghan, principal research associate at the Urban Institute. ""These things are not cheap, but inaction in our housing sector in terms of climate retrofits is gonna be really costly down the road,"" McTarnaghan says.

Last year alone, there were 27 confirmed billion-dollar disasters in the U.S., totaling at least $182 billion.

Yoon went to Vienna last spring and visited green social housing, including Schublach's building. On Yoon's Vienna trip there were city representatives from Nashville, Denver, Seattle and Philadelphia. ""We've all been Vienna-pilled,"" says Emily Gallagher, New York state representative who went to Vienna in 2022.

Mixed-income housing is ""integral to success""

At a construction site on the East River in Greenpoint in Brooklyn, a 37-story gleaming white building will soon offer apartments with views of Manhattan.

Gallagher, who represents this district, looks out over the river in black sunglasses. ""You can see the Chrysler Building,"" she says, pointing. ""You can see all of the East Village.""

The building, now called The Riverie, will soon be the largest geothermal-powered building in the state. Thirty percent of the building's housing will be designated as affordable, according to a release on the developer's website.

In Vienna, much of the long-term popularity of social housing comes down to the fact that residents of different social classes have access to the same high quality amenities, Cohen at UC Berkeley says.

This is on full view in Biotope City, a development in Vienna's south where the majority of the apartments are city-subsidized. For resident Hasret Iscen, who pays about $1,015 a month for her three-bedroom flat, her rent includes access to her building's rooftop pool, a communal sauna and multiple communal gardens. Her apartment balcony is nestled in the trees of the nearby park. "" It feels like living in a jungle because we hear all the voices from birds in our flat,"" Iscen says. ""It's wonderful.""

Most of Vienna's new social housing is city-subsidized, like Iscen's apartment building. While rents vary, city-subsidized rents tend to be higher than in city-built housing and sometimes require a down payment. It ""tends to be more oriented toward people in the middle income kind of section of society, rather than those with lowest incomes,"" Cohen at UC Berkeley says.

Vienna's system works, Cohen says, because lower-income residents can still find homes in city-built housing, ""which is a bit more of a safety net.""

Ultimately, Cohen says a key lesson from Vienna for the U.S. is the need for balance. ""You don't want to just pull one part of the model,"" he says. ""You wanna make sure that you are providing really good quality housing from the very lowest incomes all the way up.""

Making housing for all social classes is a goal of Chicago's new climate-friendly housing, according to Yoon at Chicago's mayor's office. ""This mixed-income model of social housing is absolutely integral to the success,"" Yoon says.

""If people of all walks of life are benefiting from this it is gonna be much harder to unwind, and much easier to defend politically.""

Yoon says in some communities there is some stigma against public housing, though she says that has shifted. She mostly hears from people who just want more housing options. ""We have a major housing crisis in the city — as do most places,"" she says. ""If anything, people just want more affordable housing.""

A new American dream

For a long time, a big part of the American dream has been owning a single-family home in the suburbs. But those houses are increasingly threatened by wildfire, floods and heat. It's harder to get home insurance. For many Americans, the lack of safe, affordable housing is pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach.

Schublach has now lived in Vienna for 22 years, but he grew up in the Austrian countryside. He says in the countryside there's also a dream of a single-family home. ""I think it's very similar to the American dream,"" he says. ""And the downside is that this dream for most people has become unaffordable.""

""So yes, this dream still exists. Some say it has become kind of a nightmare,"" Schublach says with a laugh. ""It's really a dream which cannot be fulfilled by many.""

But Schublach has found a new dream. In his climate-friendly social housing he's found a sense of community. The oldest inhabitant in his building is almost 80 and the youngest is less than 1 month old. He says they're all there for each other.

""If somebody needs a banana at 8 p.m. because the kid would not eat anything else, then you get a banana within one minute,"" Schublach says.

And the next time there's a storm or a heat wave in Vienna — because there will be a next time — Schublach says he'll be there for his neighbors, and they'll be there for him.

Schublach says people in the U.S. may look at Vienna's climate-friendly affordable housing and feel daunted, thinking the U.S. is too far behind. But he's optimistic.

""If it can be done in a city like Vienna with 2 million inhabitants, I see no reason why this cannot be done in any major or smaller U.S. city,"" Schublach says. ""This is something we can shape. It's not given, it's something we shape.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+32/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Fcd%2F5553db2d479a8c05d42e3715581d%2F359a8555.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 10:02:24.950466

With demand for EVs in low gear, GM is investing $4 billion to make more gasoline-powered vehicles and to do so in the United States, according to Axios.

Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee plants are expected to start more production in 2027.

GM’s Detroit-area Orion Assembly plant, once touted as the home for EV production, will instead be making gas-powered full-size SUVs and pickups.

As the gasoline-powered Chevy Equinox moves into the fast lane of sales, GM is expanding its Fairfax Assembly plant near Kansas City. The expansion includes work currently done in Mexico transitioning to the facility.

Production of the gas-powered Chevy Blazer will likewise take place in Spring Hill, Tennessee, instead of Mexico.

The decision was backed by the United Auto Workers.

“GM’s decision to invest billions in American plants and prioritize U.S. workers is exactly why we spoke up in favor of these auto tariffs,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement.

“The writing is on the wall: the race to the bottom is over. We have excess manufacturing capacity at our existing plants, and auto companies can easily bring good union jobs back to the U.S. They can prove the naysayers wrong by investing in our communities and putting workers before corporate greed. GM is showing that it can be done,” he said.

Although four years ago GM claimed it could have an all-EV lineup by 2035, GM’s investment in gasoline-powered vehicles means the company is “giving up any hope of achieving” the 2035 goal, Sam Abuelsamid, an auto analyst at Telemetry, a Detroit-based research firm, reacted following the announcement, according to Politico.

GM said it was not changing its faith in EVs.

“We still believe in an all-EV future,” the company said in a statement.

The company’s 2035 goal “was aspirational. It was more an idea than a strategy,” Alan Baum, an independent Detroit auto analyst, remarked.

“GM’s doing a better job than many of their competitors, but there’s obviously a relatively low ceiling because of the lack of supportive policy,” he said.

And there is the fact that many people just plain do not want an electric vehicle.

A recent American Automobile Association survey found only 16 percent of the American adults responding that they were either “likely” or “very likely” to buy an EV for their next vehicle, according to Autoweek.

That figure was the lowest in the survey since 2019.

Meanwhile, the number of respondents saying they were “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to buy an EV increased to 63 percent, up from 51 percent in 2022.

Money factored into how respondents view EVs, with 62 percent saying they were turned off by high battery repair costs while 59 percent said EVs cost too much.

Underlining the dedicated efforts from the Centre to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, Joshi said, ""The Government is backing this sector with full seriousness.","Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], June 15 (ANI): On the occasion of Global Wind Day 2025, Union Minister of New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi addressed a conference of stakeholders in Bengaluru today and said that Wind Energy is at the centre of India's strategy for the renewable energy sector.

Joshi said that India needs energy to become a global manufacturing hub, whether it is solar, wind, or other forms.

India has achieved 51.5 GW wind capacity, 150 per cent growth in a decade and is now exporting turbines and components globally, Minister Joshi said.

""We are moving steadily towards the 100 GW wind target by 2030, including 30 GW from offshore projects, backed by strong policy reforms and a robust manufacturing ecosystem,"" he added.

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy Shripad Yesso Naik and the Energy Minister in the Government of Karnataka, KG George, were also present on this occasion.

""Our national goals are ambitious and clear: 50 per cent of our power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, and a net-zero India by 2070. Wind energy is central to achieving these goals. Wind energy is not a component of our renewable energy strategy, but it is at the heart of it and at the centre of Atma Nirbhar Bharat,"" said the minister.

Underlining the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Joshi said, ""Narendra Modi gave us a vision to have 'renewable energy for manufacturing and conventional energy for household consumption'.""

India's manufacturing capacity is increasing, and it will continue to increase.

PM's vision stresses upon the importance of renewable energy production, storage and usage, so that once India becomes a global manufacturing hub in near future, it should be able to fulfill the energy demands of the manufacturing sector through renewable energy sources, said the minister.

India has the huge potential in the renewable energy sector as it has globally the fourth largest wind power installed capacity and iis third largest renewable energy producer.

""No one had thought that India would become the third largest manufacturer of renewable energy in 10 years, but today it is a reality,"" said the minister.

The minister underlined the 3 key issues for the Wind Energy sector saying, ""First, we must combine wind with solar and storage (BESS) to deliver round-the-clock power and grid stability. Second, tariffs must be competitive. A rate of Rs 3.90 per unit is too high; we must work together to reduce costs. Third, domestic manufacturing must become more efficient, not just to meet our own targets, but to boost exports.""

Underlining the dedicated efforts from the Centre to unleash the potential of the renewable energy sector, Joshi said, ""The Government is backing this sector with full seriousness. This year's renewable energy budget has gone up by 53 per cent, to Rs 26,549 crore, with a large share directed to wind.""

""The transition to renewables is inevitable. States must lead this transition. Land availability and transmission delays have to be overcome. This is not the time for hesitation, it is the time for execution,"" the minister added.

The Minister said, "" I am happy to note that India is manufacturing wind turbines ranging from 225 kW to 5.2 MW, with 33 models being produced by 14 companies. These turbines meet our domestic needs and are also cost-competitive globally.""

The Minister further added that to fully unlock national wind potential, a coordinated national push is needed.

""That is why we are focusing on 5 priorities: Expanding into new states like Madhya Pradesh,Telangana, and Odisha; Launching the offshore sector with 4 GW of leasing areas identified in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and tenders being readied; Integrating wind into round-the-clock and firm green power strategies, through storage-linked business models; Modernising the grid, investing in AI-based forecasting to manage variable renewable energy; and Boosting local manufacturing across the entire wind value chain,"" he said.

Union Minister Joshi also released reports on Wind Energy Roadmap and Manufacturing Roadmap at the event. He said that the documents will serve as guiding frameworks for our journey ahead and reflect our collective ambition, strategic thinking, and commitment to building a strong and Aatmanirbhar wind energy ecosystem in India.

Best performing States in terms of Wind Capacity addition were also felicitated at the event. Karnataka was first with a wind capacity addition of 1331.48 MW followed by Tamil Nadu (1136.37 MW) and Gujarat (954.76 MW).

India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through fossil fuels, and various renewable energy sources, including wind energy, are seen as an avenue to reduce dependence on conventional sources of power. Green energy for climate mitigation is not just a focus area for India; it has gained momentum globally.

At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part ""Panchamrit"" pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. (ANI)

In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.

BIRMINGHAM — When Jilisa Milton received the grant termination letter, she wasn’t surprised. She suspected this day would come.

The language the Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP) had used in its application to the Environmental Protection Agency had been clear. “We’re talking about helping a community,” Milton, GASP’s executive director, said last week, “where Black people have been disproportionately impacted.”

Black residents had breathed heavily polluted air from a nearby coke plant for decades, and their neighborhoods had been declared a federal hazardous waste Superfund site after it was determined that waste soil laced with arsenic, lead and benzo(a)pyrene, a human carcinogen, from several nearby coke plants had been spread around their homes as yard fill.

In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.

Milton received the letter earlier this month from officials in President Donald Trump’s EPA terminating the grant because it no longer aligned with the agency’s priorities.

“I knew at some point they would notice the language of our grant,” Milton said, in that it made reference to services intended to help Black people.

Still, she said she doesn’t regret the way GASP characterized the situation on the ground in north Birmingham—that the need for air monitoring stemmed from the city’s history of corporate exploitation of majority-Black workers and residents.

Growing up in Birmingham, Milton said her grandparents often discussed the legacy of workers in the Magic City—so-nicknamed because of the seemingly supernatural economic boom spurred by steel production following the end of the Civil War.

“The majority of these workers were Black, and we can see the disparate impact that still has today,” Milton said. “And it’s really important for Birmingham to talk about our legacy and our history.”

Sanitizing that history, then, to comply with the Trump administration’s stated opposition to all things DEI and environmental justice—as if they were the same thing, just because they both often involve Black people—doesn’t sit well with her.

“I think the narrative work is gone then,” Milton said. “And we have to think about history so we don’t live it again.”

The grant, awarded through EPA’s small grants program, was set to fund GASP’s efforts to train residents in using air monitoring equipment to help establish a community air monitoring program, allowing those in north Birmingham access to critical information about the pollutants filling their lungs every day.

In addition to what is now the 35th Avenue Superfund site, encompassing the neighborhoods of Collegeville, Harriman Park and Fairmont, north Birmingham remains home to several polluters, leaving its residents in the 90th percentile for particulate matter, according to EJ Screen, a government tool also recently shuttered by the Trump administration.

That context of present and past pollution was what made securing funds for air monitoring so important, Milton said, giving residents an opportunity to learn more about the continued impact of industry on their health.

“For decades, residents of North Birmingham and other historically marginalized communities have been forced to live in the shadow of toxic industries with little support or transparency,” Milton wrote in a statement after receiving the termination letter. “The grant made it possible for us to monitor and document the pollution people live with everyday. Revoking this support sends a message that the health of Black, Brown, and low-income communities in Alabama is disposable.”

In its letter, EPA officials said the agency no longer supported the grant’s objectives.

“The purpose of this communication is to notify you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is hereby terminating Assistance Agreement No. EQ-02D22522 awarded to GASP,” the letter said. “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

GASP’s isn’t the only environmental justice effort in Alabama nixed by federal officials. In April, Trump announced the termination of what the administration termed an “illegal DEI” settlement aimed at addressing sewage issues in the state’s black belt that have left its majority-Black residents sometimes unable to flush their own toilets.

The agreement, reached under the Biden Administration, required the state’s Department of Public Health to improve sanitation efforts in the region. It’s still unclear what that termination will ultimately mean on the ground.

In the end, Milton said the impact of the administration’s decision to terminate the north Birmingham air monitoring grant is racist.

“Look at the way they talk about environmental justice,” she said of administration officials. “They say it’s illegal to address these issues. So you hear the things they say, and it’s reasonable to discern from that that the impact is racist, and that what they’re doing is intentional.”

People of all races are forced to face the consequences of polluted air and water, Milton emphasized, but ignoring the reality that people of color have borne and continue to bear the brunt of industrial exploitation isn’t helpful. In fact, she explained, doing so could undermine the relationship organizations like hers have built with residents of color living through the impacts of pollution every single day.

“I don’t want to sacrifice the trust we have in communities that want to be heard because they notice that we start to change the way we talk about these issues,” she said. “Because they are the most important stakeholders. They’re who we’re here to serve.”

Moving forward, GASP plans to appeal the termination with EPA officials, Milton said, though she suspects the agency is unlikely to change its mind. If that’s the case, the nonprofit will do what they’ve always done—look to individual donors to fill in the gaps. It’s work that can’t be abandoned, Milton said. Not if she can help it.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47657/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bluestone-coke-facility-for-june-15-2025-story-1024x6831749992150.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=lUJyO322,N,,2025-06-15 12:14:19.005882

Lucid Group is growing faster than Rivian

When it comes to growth, Lucid is the clear winner right now. In fact, Lucid should be one of the fastest-growing EV makers over the next year or two. Analysts predict 73% sales growth this year, and another 96% growth expected in 2026. Rivian, for comparison, is expected to grow sales by just 5% this year, though that is expected to pick up to a roughly 40% pace in 2026.

Why is Lucid growing faster than Rivian? Demand growth for both conventional and electric vehicles does vary from year to year. But for EV pure-plays, by far the biggest driver of growth is the introduction of new models.

Earlier this year, Lucid began scaling up the production of its new Gravity SUV. SUVs are one of the highest-selling and fastest-growing categories of vehicles in the U.S. The introduction of the Gravity SUV also doubles Lucid's lineup. Previously, it only had a single model -- the Lucid Air sedan -- available to purchase. Now, its more diversified lineup and greater overall production should fuel heavy sales growth in both 2025 and 2026.

There's just one problem: An EV from Lucid still costs anywhere from $70,000 to $249,000 depending on the exact model and package. The top of that range is for its luxury Air Sapphire model, but even the low end prices out the majority of North American buyers.

To really fuel massive and long-term growth, more affordable options are needed. And while Lucid has teased plans for three affordable models, details about them have been scarce. Moreover, with less than $1.9 billion in cash on the books, it's not clear that the company has the capital to get these new vehicles into production anytime soon.

Rivian, by contrast, has a huge advantage in this department.

When it comes to EV companies, bet on capital

Over the past few decades, numerous electric car start-ups have gone under. Why? They ran out of money. Designing, building, and marketing a vehicle from scratch typically takes billions of dollars and perhaps a decade or more. All of this typically occurs when the start-up is still deeply unprofitable.

To keep such companies afloat requires investors to willingly plug the gap, providing more and more capital until management can turn its vision into reality. Small missteps or timeline delays along the way can cause investors to lose faith. That can restrict capital availability, often sending once-promising start-ups into financing free fall.

Lucid is still operating in this critical phase. It may want to roll out new mass-market models, but will need to raise a significant amount of cash in order to do so. It's not clear yet whether that will happen.

Rivian, meanwhile, is in a significantly better financial position. Its three upcoming mass-market vehicles -- the R2, R3, and R3X -- appear much further along in the development pipeline than Lucid's new models. Rivian confirmed last month that it is still on track to start production of the R2 in the first half of 2026 with a starting price of around $45,000. The R3 and R3X will follow sometime later.

While Lucid only has around $1.9 billion in cash, Rivian has nearly $4.7 billion on its books. Plus, over the past two quarters, Rivian has achieved positive gross margins, which Lucid has never managed. This all makes it much more likely that Rivian will successfully launch its first mass-market vehicles. And as Tesla has proven, that is perhaps the most important milestone an EV maker can achieve on its journey to unlock long-term growth.

So while Lucid is growing faster right now, Rivian looks like the better EV stock to own over the next few years and beyond.

A fifth one, which was expected to be the Electra E5 EV, was supposed to arrive in 2024. However, General Motors postponed the plan, following the automaker's decision to slow down its ambitious EV goals. We have yet to hear an update about Buick's first EV for America. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, the Electra E5 is already receiving a plethora of updates.

The refreshed Buick Electra E5 in China is touted to have 47 improvements in design, performance, intelligent technology, and everyday convenience. More importantly, it will be the first to debut the updated Ultium 2.0 platform - a name that has been retired in the US. In its new version, the EV architecture can support a maximum voltage of nearly 900V, which means ultra-fast charging capabilities.

Ultrafast-Charging 900V Architecture On Employ

And ultra-fast charging it is. A 10-minute stop of the refreshed Electra E5 at a charging station adds 217 miles of range. The model uses a 6C lithium iron phosphate (LFP) fast-charging battery, co-developed by SAIC General Motors and CATL. This new battery offers over 373 miles of driving on one full charge, rated on the more forgiving CLTC cycle. It's important to note that the outgoing version offers ranges of either 339 or 385 miles.

Still donning Buick’s PURE Design language, first seen on the Electra-X Concept in 2023, the Electra E5 retains the sleek, closed grille for its fascia, while a bit of a clean-up has been employed compared to the outgoing version. It retains its dimensions for the refresh, sitting below the Buick Enclave in terms of size, while other updates include a new set of 18- or 19-inch wheels and shiny chrome accents replacing the gloss black window linings.

Buick Could Use A Fifth Model To Expand The Lineup

Buick also streamlined the Electra E5 lineup in China, with only a single-motor version retained for the facelifted version. This model makes 241 horsepower and runs on front wheels, which will likely have the longest range available when equipped with the bigger battery. It's unclear whether the other options (there were three before) will be offered in the future.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/refreshed-buick-electra-e5-china-01.png,N,,2025-06-15 12:12:18.375282

The electric buses also use regenerative braking to recharge as they descend from mountain passes, improving their efficiency by using gravity to their advantage.","The future of conservation has arrived in South Lake Tahoe, and it’s surprisingly quiet. Electric transit buses now glide through mountain passes that once echoed with diesel engines. In their first year of operation, five electric buses serving the Lake Tahoe area logged nearly 67,000 miles, eliminated 13,000 gallons of diesel consumption, and prevented 136 tons of carbon dioxide from entering our atmosphere. But these buses aren’t just an environmental win – they’re a potential financial lifeline for our struggling national park system.

As America’s natural crown jewels face their greatest fiscal threat in generations, park managers must embrace electrification as a path to survival. The proposed federal budget slashes over one billion dollars from the National Park Service – the largest cut in its 109-year history. Already, a thousand rangers have lost their jobs. Park superintendents are drafting plans for 30 percent payroll reductions. This crisis comes during record attendance, with more than 330 million visitors flocking to national parks in 2024, creating an impossible equation: do drastically more with dramatically less.

Fuel costs present a prime target for budget-conscious park managers. Every diesel-powered shuttle burns approximately one dollar of fuel per mile. Across the vast distances covered by Yosemite’s valley shuttles or Sequoia’s giant forest service, a single bus consumes tens of thousands of dollars in diesel annually – funds that could instead support vital staffing and visitor services.

Electrifying park shuttles and other vehicles offers immediate relief. Operating an electric bus costs just 44 cents per mile , and eliminates traditional maintenance expenses like oil changes and exhaust repairs. Over its twelve-year service life, a single electric bus returns more than $400,000 in avoided costs – easily justifying the higher initial investment even before grants enter the equation.

The financial barriers to electrification are falling rapidly. Tahoe’s hybrid fleet and charging infrastructure were partially funded through a $3.4 million Federal Transit Administration grant made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. California’s Innovative Clean Transit rule provides additional incentives for early adopters, while the Inflation Reduction Act offers a 30 percent tax credit for public-private charging projects. These incentives, combined with the dramatic decline in battery costs have made electric buses an affordable option for fleet operators as soon as they are put into service.

Critics argue that parks and natural areas present difficult to solve electrification or infrastructure challenges. These concerns reflect engineering challenges, not fundamental flaws. At my company, Camber, we designed Tahoe’s charging depot with these considerations in mind. Their electric buses use overhead pantographs to charge at high speed while out running their routes, limiting any range anxiety concerns. The electric buses also use regenerative braking to recharge as they descend from mountain passes, improving their efficiency by using gravity to their advantage. Similar solutions can work throughout California’s diverse park systems. What we cannot engineer away are the budget shortfalls that threaten to close campgrounds, reduce services, and ultimately force privatization of our public lands.

California has pioneered conservation before. Yosemite became America’s first federally protected landscape because Californians demonstrated that environmental stewardship could coexist with public access. Zion National Park made history as the first national park to commit to a zero-emission transportation fleet, and now it’s time for California’s parks to also lead the way by adopting a bold yet achievable timeline to transition to electric fleets.

By going electric, our treasured parks can save millions annually while insulating themselves from the political volatility in Washington. They will also demonstrate to visitors – who consistently rate the Park Service as one of America’s most beloved and trusted federal agencies – that conservation can be both cutting-edge and timeless. Our parks deserve nothing less.

Meanwhile, as the pipeline at the former Grangemouth oil refinery runs dry as production ends there was some good news.","Grangemouth plans to be announced 'soon' - minister

The UK government's energy minister has said there will be ""announcements soon"" on the future of Grangemouth.

Michael Shanks, who is also the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, said the government was exploring a range of ""exciting and viable"" projects to secure a long-term transition for the site.

Owners of the refinery, Petroineos, ceased crude oil processing in April, with a planned closure this summer resulting in the loss of 430 jobs.

Shanks said more than 80 potential investors in the site had come forward, with Scottish Enterprise handling due diligence on proposed projects.

However the Scottish Conservatives have criticised Labour's approach to Grangemouth, saying it is ""managed decline"".

Both the UK and Scottish governments have pledged millions of pounds to support the site, while the results of a £1.5m feasibility study - looking at potential low-carbon alternative uses - was published in March.

Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Show, Shanks said discussions with investors on Grangemouth's future was ongoing and that they were focused on the ""long-term"".

He said: ""We've had some really positive meetings around potential investors, in fact there's more than 80 investors who have come forward.

""I'm hopeful we will have some announcements soon. We have some really exciting, viable projects coming forward that will deliver jobs at Grangemouth long into the future.""

Earlier this week, Jan Robertson, Grangemouth director for Scottish Enterprise, said she had received a ""mixture of inquiries"" from businesses, including those interested in the site as well as some which ""have a good opportunity to become projects in the relatively near-term"".

""What I mean by that is the next three to four years,"" she told Holyrood's economy and fair work committee.

""Our approach very much at the moment is working with those and working as closely and quickly as we can to make the progress that we want to see in Grangemouth.""

Scotland's Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin said at the committee that the ""door's not closed"" to companies and inquiries could still be made about working at Grangemouth, adding that Petroineos had also received approaches.

Ms Martin said she was hopeful for the future of Grangemouth.

""We could look back five years and start pointing fingers, but the most important thing is that in the last year - actually the last six months - Project Willow and the task force have moved things along in a way that's been swift, agile, focused,"" she said.

""I am feeling so much more confident than I did this time last year in the prospects for that site.""

Shanks' remarks come days after the UK government confirmed £200m would be provided to progress the Acorn Carbon Capture and Storage scheme in Aberdeenshire.

Acorn said part of that investment – which it claimed would secure 18,000 jobs in the energy sector that would otherwise have been lost – would involve capturing CO2 at Grangemouth and transporting it to storage facilities under the North Sea.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the Acorn scheme – which will be based at the St Fergus gas terminal near Peterhead – would ""support industrial renewal in Scotland"".

Shanks said the Acorn investment, announced as part of chancellor Rachel Reeves' spending review, was designed to lure in further funding from private investment.

He described it as ""development funding"" and said he was ""confident"" other investors would come forward.

Shanks also said current North Sea oil and gas projects would be allowed to run to completion but reiterated that no further licenses for drilling would be granted.

Reeves' spending review also committed £14.2bn of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 jobs.

Shanks said that Scotland was missing out on similar investment, and repeated calls for the Scottish government to end its ""ideological position"" of presumption against nuclear power.

The SNP has long rejected calls to end its effective ban, saying investment would be ""better placed in areas of renewable energy"".

Shanks said: ""I'm not going to make any apologies for the government investing in nuclear where thousands of highly skilled jobs could be delivered including in Scotland if it wasn't for the ideological position of the SNP to block new nuclear.

""We could be delivering those well paid, skilled jobs here in Scotland but they've turned their face against that and they'll have to answer for that.""

Jackie Dunbar, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Donside said that the money spent on nuclear plants was a ""waste"" which would not change what people pay for energy in Scotland.

She said: ""The evidence shows that nuclear is expensive, takes decades to build and the toxic waste is a risk to local communities. The SNP is clear that Scotland's future should be in cheaper, safer and cleaner renewables which support more jobs.""

'Tone deaf'

The Scottish Conservatives' energy spokesman, Douglas Lumsden, described Shanks' comments as ""tone deaf,"" accusing the Labour government of ""economic vandalism"".

He reiterated calls by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch for new licences to be issued for oil drilling in the North Sea.

He said: ""Labour has sold our oil and gas industry down the river – and the SNP's cheering them on.

""Michael Shanks talks about managing the transition, but this is managed decline. At this pace, we'll lose 400 jobs every two weeks, like shutting Grangemouth twice a month.

""We need to bin the Energy Profits Levy and lift the ban on new licences - before it's too late.""

The latest escalation in the Middle East has sent oil prices soaring with questions about what that could mean for the world economy.

The UK energy minister Michael Shanks told the BBC's Sunday Show his department is ""preparing for all scenarios"" as there's concern motorists could be hit hard with a doubling of the price at the pumps.

As many focus on life ""beyond oil"", it's a stark reminder that it's still the vital fuel for the world economy.

Opponents have claimed this government doesn't back the North Sea enough and that increasing production locally could provide energy security.

He said it doesn't matter where the oil comes from as it's still subject to the volatility of international oil markets.

As Scotland is steered into that post-oil world, the minister also expressed his support for the north-east sector to ensure there's a ""just transition"".

He was once again critical of the SNP's stance against nuclear – but there's concern the UK government is directing too much of an investment towards that as part of the UK's energy mix.

Meanwhile, as the pipeline at the former Grangemouth oil refinery runs dry as production ends there was some good news.

Michael Shanks is hopeful of an announcement soon on its future.

His government's made £200m available to try to create a long-term future for the area and Scottish Enterprise is conducting ""due diligence"" on potential investors.

The remaining industry will watch with interest to see if this works – and judge how ""just"" this transition is.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5f97/live/1c3eae90-49df-11f0-9471-e380f647874e.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 11:05:24.869211

The Healey-Driscoll administration last week announced $9.5 million going to eight school districts and private transportation providers as the third round of the School Bus Deployment program. The initiative, funded by the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, helps communities replace diesel-powered school buses with electric alternatives, as well as providing the expertise needed for the switch to electric.

“Electric school buses are an example of how we can improve public health across the state,” Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper said in a statement.

So far, the program has awarded more than $27.5 million to school districts and consultants, leveraging more than $100 million in external funding.

For the Amherst-Pelham district, the grant helps build on money received last year from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which announced that the schools would add three new electric school buses to the fleet of buses using a $600,000 grant from the Clean School Bus Program, created in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

The money received then was to buy the buses, each valued at $200,000 each, as the schools negotiated a lease agreement with Highland, the transportation company that applied for the grant on the district’s behalf. The district also had one electric bus on order through another EPA program known as the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, awarded in 2022.

Highland Electric Fleets is a company dedicated to the electrification of fleets. It manages the electrification process for clients and procures and implements the necessary infrastructure over long-term contract periods, usually of 10 to 15 years.

But those buses weren’t anticipated to begin serving students until 2026 or 2027, with an official explaining this would give “time to design, purchase, and install charging infrastructure.” In addition, the challenges of not having sufficient high-speed charging infrastructure across the state is preventing the district from moving entirely away from diesel-powered buses.

Previously, in 2016, Amherst was one of three Massachusetts communities, along with Concord and Cambridge, that received funding to participate in a pilot project to purchase and test electric school buses.

Unlike fuel, the cost of offshore wind is not impacted by severe weather events.
He has advanced efforts to strengthen the offshore wind industry, supporting initiatives like the CVOW project and the LS GreenLink wind supply chain manufacturing facility.","The largest offshore wind project in the United States is set to be completed on time—a win for an industry that has faced uncertainty under the Trump administration. Construction of Dominion Energy’s 176-turbine project off the coast of Virginia Beach is nearly 60 percent complete, according to the company. When completed, the project is expected to generate enough energy to power roughly 660,000 homes, or 25 percent of Dominion’s residential customers in Virginia.

In January, President Trump signed an executive order that halted new leases for offshore wind in federal waters and directed federal agencies to pause permitting for onshore and offshore wind projects.

The administration went further to stop one project—Empire Wind, a massive wind farm off the coast of Long Island—with a stop-work order in April that sparked concern in the wind industry. The order was lifted on May 19 after New York Governor Kathy Hochul spent weeks negotiating with the administration, allowing the $5 billion project to continue.

Dominion’s largest project in Virginia, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW), is still moving ahead. The facility is on schedule for its target completion date at the end of 2026, said John Larson, director of public policy and economic development at Dominion Energy. Some wind turbines will be installed later this summer and will begin delivering power later this year, he said. Two six-megawatt pilot turbines have been delivering power since October 2020.

Eileen Woll, former offshore energy program director for the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter, which has been involved in moving the project forward since 2013, said the path is clear for Dominion to complete it. When it comes to the political challenges, “there’s only so much we can do about Trump and his pause,” Woll said. But she is hopeful that there won’t be any roadblocks in developing CVOW. “There’s just too much of a support system,” she said.

While construction hasn’t stopped, the Trump administration’s tariffs on the steel industry may drive up the project’s cost. Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion, said the tariffs would add an additional $120 million through the end of the second quarter. If the tariffs stay in effect through the end of the project, they would add an additional $500 million to the cost. For Dominion’s customers, that would mean an additional 4 cents per month on their utility bills, Slayton said.

Larson said that offshore wind saves customers and the state money in the long run. Unlike fuel, the cost of offshore wind is not impacted by severe weather events. For example, in December 2023, a storm in Virginia caused rolling blackouts in surrounding states and drove up demand for natural gas. On Christmas Eve that year, the price of fuel skyrocketed. If the CVOW project had been completed, Larson said, it would have saved over $10 million in fuel costs in a single day.

The CVOW project has garnered bipartisan support in Virginia, which committed to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 with the passage of the Clean Economy Act in 2020. The act requires Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power—the largest utilities in the state—to deliver electricity from 100 percent renewable sources by 2045 and 2050, respectively.

Virginia is a regulated utility state, which means major utilities such as Dominion Energy operate as monopolies within their designated service areas. The Virginia State Corporation Commission oversees and approves their rates and services to ensure that consumers receive services at just and reasonable rates.

Even Virginia’s Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin recognizes the value and opportunity of offshore wind in the state. He has advanced efforts to strengthen the offshore wind industry, supporting initiatives like the CVOW project and the LS GreenLink wind supply chain manufacturing facility. .

Supporters of CVOW say it will bring economic benefits to the region by creating new jobs in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance. This summer, there will be 1,500 people working on the project, Larson said. On average, 900 people will be employed per year over the life of the project. Dominion has been working with local communities, including K-12 schools, community colleges, and higher education institutions to recruit personnel.

The CVOW project has received some pushback from community members concerned about their ocean view and fossil fuel companies, said Grayson Holmes, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). Community pushback has been relatively minimal, he added.

Last year, a coalition of conservatives sued the Biden administration, seeking to halt construction of CVOW. The groups, including the Koch-funded Heartland Institute, claimed that federal agencies did not adequately address the ecological impacts of the project and ignored threats to endangered North Atlantic Right Whales when they approved the project. SELC continues to be hopeful that the federal government will defend the permits.

SELC worked with Dominion to ensure that land and marine animal protections were put in place, Holmes said. Construction of the project can only take place from May to October, when endangered whales are least likely to be in the area. Dominion has trained observers on their boats who track the whales, he said. “They can’t completely eliminate the impacts, but they’re doing what they can.”

In Virginia, the demand for energy has skyrocketed as data centers continue to expand in the state. Virginia is the largest data center market in the world—about 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic runs through Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. Offshore wind could help offset this demand, Holmes said. “Wind is not the only solution, but it’s an important part of the overall spectrum,” he said. “It feels like it should be a win-win for everyone.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-15 09:01:33.449869

This percentage, set by state regulators, is the return on equity—one of the most important numbers in utility finance.
SDG&E’s prices have risen because of large increases in spending that the utility has proposed and that regulators approved.
“At the highest level, this claim [that utility consumers are overcharged] rests on the assumption that regulatory commissions and their staff are biased toward utility investors and against consumers,” he said.
Utility regulators could decide on their own to reform the process of setting returns on equity, but Ellis thinks it may require changes in state or federal law.","SAN DIEGO—On a walk near his house, with views of the ocean, Mark Ellis speaks with urgency about how the utility business—the industry that long employed him—is harming the public with unsustainable rate increases.

He keeps coming back to the same point: The complexity of utility regulation is obscuring a transfer of wealth from the general public to shareholders on a vast scale.

He’s far from the first person to say this. But he’s getting attention to a degree others haven’t, thanks to the clarity of his message and his status as a former utility insider. He’s in the early stages of becoming an activist.

Ellis’ adversaries should know what they’re up against. He is a financial analyst, with degrees from Harvard and MIT, and he is a wrestler, with experience on the mat as recently as two years ago, when he was competing in his age division in national tournaments.

“I don’t like bullies,” he said. “I feel like there’s a lot of bullying going on with utilities. People need to stand up to the bully.”

U.S. households have seen their electricity prices increase by an average of 25 percent from 2020 to 2024, which exceeds the rate of inflation, according to the Energy Information Administration.

When electricity is unaffordable, the transition away from fossil fuels becomes expensive to the point that it stretches feasibility; ideas such as electrifying home heating and using electricity to power vehicles make less sense in purely financial terms.

Ellis, 55, isn’t saying the increases should be zero. He’s saying that the growth has been supercharged by the failure of regulators who have allowed utilities to earn a guaranteed profit that is larger than he believes is appropriate.

He is a customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, or SDG&E, a utility with some of the highest electricity prices in the country. The company is a subsidiary of Sempra, which was his employer for 15 years. He left in 2019, when he was chief of corporate strategy.

Sempra, the country’s sixth-largest utility holding company based on market value, did not respond to requests for comment.

Ellis is not exactly a whistleblower, since the conduct he’s talking about is legal. But his current work threatens to disturb a world in which utilities usually get most of what they want when they propose rate increases. In the last year or so, he has given lectures, written op-eds and published a paper with American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly think tank.

Ellis is “turning a lot of heads,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy & Policy Institute, a watchdog organization that does research on utilities. Ellis’ work is resonating because he’s the first person in recent memory, according to Pomerantz, “who saw how all this happened from inside one of the corporate utilities, and he has the data to back it up.”

How Utilities Make Money

Ellis lives a short drive from Torrey Pines Gliderport, an oceanside park where people paraglide over the sand and cliffs, and many others come to get a cold drink and some food from the concession stand and enjoy the view.

There, seated along a wooden rail overlooking the colorful scene of people floating through the air with parachutes, he took out some scrap paper and began to write down numbers to make his case.

His argument, at its core, is about how utilities have been able to get compliant regulators to approve levels of profit that are too high.

Let’s consider a hypothetical utility whose costs are split 50-50 between day-to-day operations and investment in long-term infrastructure. (The specifics here are simplified to aid in explanation.)

A utility can recover 100 percent of its operational costs from customers through rates. This is a pass through of costs, covering salaries, maintenance, fuel and anything else that isn’t a hard asset.

So far, this utility hasn’t made any profit.

Ellis explains, scribbling on his paper, that a utility pays for infrastructure with a mix of debt and equity. The company recovers these costs from customers through equal payments over the lives of the assets, so a power plant with a 30-year lifespan would be paid for with annual installments of one-thirtieth of the total.

Debt can include any kind of borrowed money, and the company can recover interest costs from consumers. Equity is the money the utility raises by selling stock to the public.

The equity portion of this mix is where “return on equity” comes into play, and this is where the main problem lies, according to Ellis.

If a utility has used equity to pay, say, $10 billion to finance assets that it’s currently using, including new assets and ones that may go back decades, it can charge customers each year for a percentage of this value. This percentage, set by state regulators, is the return on equity—one of the most important numbers in utility finance.

If regulators authorize a return on equity of 10 percent, which is about the national average, the resulting charge for one year is $1 billion.

This is the utility’s profit.

It’s not transparent to ratepayers. There is no line item on bills for profit. It’s baked into the underlying charges.

A casual observer may surmise that a 10 percent return on equity is about 10 percent of a household’s bill, but it doesn’t work that way. The actual amount varies based on the value of a utility’s assets, among other factors. Most of the time, profit is 15 percent to 20 percent of the bill. The research and advocacy group RMI has found that profit is 16.7 percent of a typical utility bill.

The $1 billion in profit in his example is grossly excessive, Ellis believes.

If utilities and their regulators were following basic regulatory principles, the profit would be more like $600 million, he said.

How did he get those lower numbers? That’s another discussion, and it begins on the drive back to his house.

The Gap Between Fair and Excessive

Ellis and his wife raised their four children—three sons and a daughter—in their large modern house in La Jolla, a neighborhood on the north end of San Diego. Inside the front door, his black wrestling shoes sit in a pile with other shoes.

Over several hours, moving between the wide-open living room and tree-lined patio out back, he tells a story that could be described as Regulation 101.

The U.S. utility business model has been around for more than a century. It is based on the idea that a utility is a natural monopoly that should work for the public good and have its profit set by regulators.

Profit is necessary so that a utility can attract investment from stockholders and then use the proceeds to do major projects. The level of profit should be whatever is needed to attract enough investment, which is a standard that comes from U.S. Supreme Court cases, such as Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas, decided in 1944. The utility then provides value to shareholders by paying dividends and taking actions that lead to increases in the value of the stock.

“An investor is giving you money, and then you are paying them back over time,” Ellis said.

Regulators have a responsibility to set a utility’s return on equity high enough to raise the money it needs, but no higher, according to the Supreme Court.

So what’s an appropriate return on equity?

Ellis argues that a fair return would be about 6 percent for most utilities under current economic conditions. He uses common financial models to come up with this number. One model takes into account the risks of owning stock in a utility—like wildfires or regulatory changes—compared to other investments. Another model is based on the utility’s expected long-term growth.

A return on equity of 6 percent would be slightly less than the average of other investments available in the economy, Ellis said. This would still be a fair level, he said, reflecting that utilities have some risks for investors but also have many qualities that make them a safe haven, since most people have no choice but to use them.

And yet, the average return on equity for electricity and natural gas utilities in 2024 was 9.7 percent according to S&P Global Commodity Insights, much more than the level needed to attract investment based on Ellis’ analysis.

He has estimated that the difference between the actual average and what he believes it should be is about $50 billion per year nationwide, or $300 per household.

The numbers should make utility executives feel a sense of shame, he said.

“Let’s Work Together”

Ellis’ bluntness gets attention, but it also may undercut his credibility in some circles. So how do his views line up with those of others who have looked deeply at the same issues?

Karl Dunkle Werner and Stephen Jarvis wrote a working paper last year for the energy institute at the University of California, Berkeley, in which they found a persistent gap between utilities’ average return on equity and the level that would be appropriate. The gap ranged from 2 to 4 percentage points over several decades.

“It consistently seems like [utilities are] being paid too much,” said Jarvis, who now teaches at the London School of Economics.

He emphasized that even when the overcharge is at the low end of the range—closer to 2 percentage points than 4 percentage points—that’s still huge when multiplied by the value of utilities’ assets.

Another way to look at the possibility of excessive profit is to track utilities’ returns on equity over time and compare them to other financial benchmarks, like the costs of government bonds. Werner and Jarvis illustrate this with a chart that runs from the mid-1970s to the mid-2020s.

The chart takes the complexity of many variables and tells a simple story: U.S. regulators responded to high interest rates and economic instability in the early 1980s by allowing utilities to earn higher returns on equity than before. But then, as interest rates dropped and the economy stabilized, returns on equity remained high, opening up the gap that still exists today.

RMI issued a report in February that identified high returns on equity as a major problem.

“High ROEs make utility service more expensive than it needs to be, adding pressure to the pace of transition due to affordability considerations,” the RMI authors said.

The report discusses the market distortions that happen when returns on equity are too high. The main one is that utilities are more likely to have a bias for building things and building as big as possible.

If a problem can be solved with either a new piece of equipment or finding ways to be more efficient with existing equipment, there is a strong incentive to choose new equipment. Over decades, this leads to an overbuilt system and unsustainable rate increases.

In interviews, authors of the Berkeley and RMI reports said they are aware of Ellis’ work and agree with the core ideas of his argument.

The areas of disagreement are minor. For example, Ellis offers a precise estimate of overpayment, while the others prefer to use ranges of numbers.

Ryan Foelske, an analyst at RMI, said reasonable observers can agree that utilities’ returns are higher than necessary, but it’s difficult to say by how much.

He said that RMI is trying to frame its analysis in a constructive way that moves a discussion forward with regulators, utilities and the public. In other words, RMI is intentionally avoiding Ellis’ sharp language.

“It’s not customers versus utilities,” Foelske said. “Let’s work together to find something that works for all of us.”

But utilities have a lot to lose. Lower returns would undercut their stock prices and upset investors. It could lead to reductions in credit ratings.

Utility executives’ compensation is heavily weighted to encourage growth in profit. Much of their personal wealth comes from utility stock and some utilities consider return on equity among the factors in determining an executive’s total pay.

Just about any attempt to reform the system is going to get intense pushback, said Pomerantz of the Energy & Policy Institute.

“It’s not customers versus utilities.”

“I would say that utilities would fight as hard as they could possibly fight, and throw every weapon in their considerable political arsenal at maintaining their currently inflated ROEs,” he said.

His organization tracks executive pay at investor-owned utilities, finding that CEOs at 54 of the companies earned a total of $530 million last year. The top earners were Christopher Womack of Georgia-based Southern Co., with $23.9 million; John Ketchum of Florida-based NextEra Energy, with $21.6 million; and Jeffrey Martin of Sempra, with $21.5 million.

A Job Change and Return to Wrestling

Ellis grew up in the San Fernando valley of Los Angeles, the son of an attorney and a high school teacher. He wrestled in high school in the 126-pound weight class. He excelled in math.

He went to Harvard for his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and then earned a master’s degree from MIT’s Technology and Policy Program.

He gained an expertise in utility finance through several early jobs, including analyzing international natural gas power projects for Exxon Mobil in the late 1990s.

This set the stage for his work at Sempra, where he had various roles from 2004 to 2019.

He is careful not to discuss internal conversations during his time as an executive at Sempra, citing the nondisclosure agreement he signed when he left. But he is comfortable saying that he became disillusioned because of a growing realization that the utility industry’s business model had drifted away from a spirit of public service.

“I wasn’t happy there, and it wasn’t consistent with my values,” he said.

Several years ago, the company eliminated his job as part of a larger reorganization, and offered him a severance package that he accepted.

Now, his main income source is doing freelance analysis for clients, which includes serving as an expert witness in utility regulatory cases.

He also returned to wrestling. He worked out at a local gym and began to enter tournaments. At the Folkstyle National Championship in 2023, he finished second out of two in his age group in the 128-pound weight class.

“One of the things I realized shortly after getting back into wrestling is that developing any character trait is like any other skill—you develop it by practicing it,” he said. “To develop courage, do things that are courageous for you, that push you out of your comfort zone, where your first instinct is avoidance. Going to wrestling practice everyday felt like an exercise in courage and it gave me confidence to be more courageous in other domains.”

“Everything Is Going Up”

The harm of high electricity prices is not obvious in La Jolla, the neighborhood where Ellis lives. The ocean waves lap the shores near the Torrey Pines Golf Course, a two-time host of the U.S. Open, and the average house sells for more than $2 million.

But shift 30 miles to the south to the San Ysidro neighborhood, along the Mexican border, and utility bills are increasingly a significant burden. The hills of Tijuana rise on the other side of this low-lying area.

Even in festive places, like El Rincon restaurant, known for the spicy kick of its coffee, utility bills are a topic that turns the mood sour.

“The community is aware that electricity is going up and it’s expensive,” said Cristian Fuentes, who works at a community nonprofit and also is chair of San Ysidro Community Planning Group, which advises the city government. “Everything is going up, from eggs to the water to the trash.”

Antonio Martinez, a member of the San Ysidro school board, said rising costs are a huge concern.

“In my portion of the city, there are a lot of people with fixed incomes,” he said. “A big increase for utility bills means less for food, less for medicine.”

SDG&E is a major funder of community nonprofits, and it has a program to help low-income residents pay their utility bills. Martinez appreciates these efforts, but he said that applying for assistance can be complicated and some people don’t know it’s available. It would be easier if bills remained at a more affordable level.

Households served by SDG&E paid an average of 43.6 cents per kilowatt-hour last year, which is more than double from a decade ago, far in excess of the rate of inflation and the highest price of any investor-owned utility in the continental United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. (If we include Alaska and Hawaii, then SDG&E ranks third, behind two in Hawaii.)

SDG&E’s prices have risen because of large increases in spending that the utility has proposed and that regulators approved. There is a back-and-forth with regulators and the utility doesn’t get everything it wants, but it gets enough for substantial growth.

Some of this spending is on things that are required by law or otherwise unavoidable, such as wildfire mitigation and state requirements for emissions reductions and building renewable energy.

While Sempra did not respond to requests for comment, its subsidiary, SDG&E, did answer questions about rates.

SDG&E said one of the main factors to keep in mind is that its households have unusually low electricity use, with an average of 365 kilowatt-hours per month. This yields a lower average bill than a customer would pay to investor-owned utilities in the Los Angeles region and the Bay Area, where electricity use is higher.

The larger point, the company said, is that there is limited usefulness in using the average rate as a benchmark unless the analysis also takes into account average usage.

Also, SDG&E said its most recent proposed rate increase, filed in March, stems from a regulatory filing that is required for all utilities in the state.

“This request aims to balance customer costs while attracting the necessary capital dollars to support safety, reliability and implement California’s aggressive clean energy policies,” the company said in an email.

The latest rate increase would be 1.4 percent of a typical residential bill, according to a disclosure sent to customers.

The company recovers its costs and also receives a return on equity of 10.23 percent, which is above the national average of 9.7 percent.

Going Head to Head

SDG&E’s return on equity is set every few years in regulatory cases before the California Public Utilities Commission. While the cases are complex, the results are easy to understand, including what Ellis views as some basic errors.

To make its argument in a 2022 case, SDG&E hired an outside expert, James M. Coyne, executive vice president for Concentric Energy Advisors, a consulting firm headquartered outside Boston.

He is a leader in his field, one of a small number of consultants who specialize in return on equity testimony before utility commissions. By Ellis’ count, fewer than a dozen people are the hired experts for utilities in the majority of cases nationwide that touch on this subject matter.

Coyne’s testimony for SDG&E supported the company’s request for a 10.55 percent return on equity. He conducted an analysis using four financial models to determine that a fair return on equity would be in the range of 10.4 percent to 11.4 percent.

One potentially confusing aspect of these cases is that analysts on all sides use some of the same models to reach different conclusions. For example, Coyne used the Capital Asset Pricing Model, a common tool for estimating the appropriate return, which can apply to any kind of investment. This was one of the same models Ellis and the Berkeley co-authors used to come up with much lower estimates.

The differences are in the assumptions that analysts plug into the models to account for factors such as investment risk. Ellis said that Coyne and other witnesses for utilities use assumptions that are “cherry picking” and “upwardly biased” to try to justify conclusions that stretch credibility.

How does Coyne respond?

“The characterization of utility witness assumptions as ‘cherry picking’ or ‘upwardly biased’ is unfounded, and perhaps more of a reflection of how far out of sync [Ellis’] own analysis is with all experts,” he said in an email.

Inside Climate News asked him for his views on three reports that argue utility returns on equity are too high—from Ellis, the Berkeley authors and RMI.

“At the highest level, this claim [that utility consumers are overcharged] rests on the assumption that regulatory commissions and their staff are biased toward utility investors and against consumers,” he said. “This would be a clear violation of the public trust bestowed either through appointment or election. In my experience, regulatory commissions weigh the evidence, often from competing experts from both utility and consumer interests and reach their determinations. I am not always in agreement with these decisions, and commissions generally do not adhere to the recommendation of a single expert, but see no evidence that bias was the cause.”

He said a drastically lower return on equity would not be supported by precedent and would be vulnerable to a challenge in court.

In the 2022 case, regulators had an opportunity to choose between Coyne’s and Ellis’ views.

Ellis filed testimony on behalf of Protect Our Communities Foundation, a San Diego consumer advocacy group. His brief dissected Coyne’s use of financial models and recommended a much lower return on equity.

The California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling giving SDG&E a return on equity close to what it had requested.

The commission said in its decision that it was based on “informed judgment” and that commissioners are aware that all models have flaws. “The models are helpful as gauges of the realm of reasonableness,” it said.

Asked to comment on the criticism of the process, commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said decisions are based on the evidence and consistent with requirements of the law and court precedent.

Serving the Greater Good

The California ruling in 2022 was significant for Ellis. His brief included much of what he knew about the way utility finance works and he thought he had made convincing arguments. He learned from the outcome that doing advocacy through regulatory cases amounted to little if the regulators weren’t going to listen.

That brings him to today. He still does expert witness work, but is just as likely to be having calls with state and federal lawmakers and writing opinion pieces in local and national media.

Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat in the Connecticut House of Representatives and the son of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), has taken an interest in Ellis’ work. So has U.S. Rep. Josh Riley (D-N.Y.), who has spoken about the consumer harm of surging electricity rates.

In February, the San Francisco Chronicle published an op-ed by Ellis with the headline “I was a California energy strategist. Here’s how the state lets PG&E give you a raw deal.” He has been quoted in stories by Politico and the Los Angeles Times, among others.

Utility regulators could decide on their own to reform the process of setting returns on equity, but Ellis thinks it may require changes in state or federal law.

He expects that public pressure will grow because the current approaches are leading to unsustainable rate increases.

Meanwhile, being a freelance expert witness and consumer advocate pays much less than being a senior analyst for a utility. Asked why he chose this path, he talked about his parents, who are still alive.

“If you have a capability, you have to use it,” he said, paraphrasing something his father says.

The larger idea, he said, is it’s not enough just to use your capability. You should use it in the service of a greater good.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250522-ICN-MarkEllis_024c.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 11:05:46.062769

The Treasury said the £2.5bn would go towards a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors.

On BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show, Shanks was challenged on the fact that billions intended for renewables will now be invested in nuclear power. Journalist Martin Geissler pointed out there was no mention of nuclear anywhere in the Labour party's manifesto ahead of the 2024 general election, but it instead focussed on clean power projects such as onshore wind, solar, and hydro power.

“Well, it's not an exclusive list, because there's a lot of other clean energy technologies,” Shanks said.

“Nuclear is part of our energy mix.

“I'm not going to make any apologies for the government investing in nuclear where thousands of highly skilled jobs can be delivered, including in Scotland if it wasn't for the ideological position of the SNP to block new nuclear, could be delivering those well paid skilled jobs here in Scotland.

“They turned their face against that, and they will have to answer for that.”

He added: “The broader point here is Great British Energy is all about harnessing the power of the public purse to invest not just in clean power projects directly but supply chains that drive them.

“Because unlike the previous government, we want to see those well paid, industrialised jobs coming alongside us, not towing in offshore wind and switching it on, but building it in this country and getting the manufacturing jobs that go with it. That's how we deliver the jobs of the future.”

Geissler put it to Shanks that oil and gas companies are leaving Aberdeen and that the just transition should be a “safety net” for workers, but that currently there is “no net” for workers.

Asked if that was a fair assessment, Shanks said: “Well, look, every single job loss is hugely distressing for the individuals and for their families and communities.

“I don't for a second discount the impact that job losses have, but I don't think that is an entirely fair assessment, because yes, there's been job losses recently announced, but there's also been thousands of jobs created.”

He added: “We shouldn’t just look at one side of the equation here.

“A transition means there will be jobs moving from one part of the industry into the other.

“We need to make sure that that happens, but we also need to support the workers to get those jobs, and that's why we announced incredibly quickly that passporting support, where if you're an offshore oil and gas worker doing a particular job and you could do the same job in offshore wind, you shouldn't have to re qualify and have your skills reassessed. You should be able to move straight into that job. That's something the previous government developed for a long time. We delivered it.”

But, if this plant can be brought back to life, maybe others can too.","With green and affordable energy at the forefront of many conversations about the future of not just our planet, but our entire economy, one of the answers that has come back again is the reopening of nuclear plants. Although maybe not as green as other alternatives, as the byproduct of nuclear energy is quite dangerous, the amount of energy that is produced by a nuclear plant is a lot more than by any other renewable source. The main drawback has always been the security of the process and of the nuclear waste, but with the advances in tech many believe that this is the moment to reactivate some of the preexisting infrastructure and improve our energy policies.

The plan started with the reactivation of the Palisades nuclear power plant in Covert Township, Michigan, which shut down in 2022. Since it has not been inactive for a long time, the facility is fairly up to date, and it should not have many problems in becoming operational once again. The reopening is being accomplished thanks to a $1.52 billion federal loan, which may seem like a lot, but it will serve to upgrade some of the most sensitive parts of the facility and will improve operations significantly.

The reopening of one of the most prolific nuclear plants

This reopening is out of the blue but quite in line with the new policies on energy established by former president Joe Biden. The aim was always to improve the environment while stop relying on fossil fuels, and since the reopening of this plant would go a long way into o tripling the nation’s nuclear output, any investment will likely have a good return.

The loan was issued to Holtec International, the company now running Palisades, and their vision goes far beyond restarting an old plant, as they are part of this ambitious program and are at the forefront of the movement to reestablish nuclear power as a key player in America’s energy future.

The plant is expected to be fully operational again by late 2025 or possibly 2026 as long as everything goes according to plan, but that might be easier said than done, because no nuclear facility that’s been taken offline for decommissioning has ever been successfully revived. This has been caused by many circumstances, like mounting maintenance costs or security issues around the nuclear materials, but Palisades could be the exception considering its short decommissioning.

Bringing this plant back online is not just about flipping some switches and turning on the lights, which is why the loan is so impressive. The plant still has to clear several hurdles, including safety evaluations and regulatory sign-offs and some equipment, like the steam generator tubes, needs a thorough once-over by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But, if this plant can be brought back to life, maybe others can too.

'With the clearance process taking at least 45 days, this added scrutiny has significantly delayed approvals. And the growing backlog has further slowed clearances, tightening global supply chains,' Crisil said.

India, which sourced over 80 per cent of its 540 tonne magnet imports from China last fiscal, has started to feel the impact, Crisil asserted.

In fiscal 2025-26, domestic passenger volumes are expected to grow 2-4 per cent, while electric passenger vehicles could rise 35-40 per cent, albeit on a low base. Electric 2Ws could grow 27 per cent, outpacing overall 2W growth of 8-10 per cent.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" aims to extend TCJA provisions, but faces challenges such as debate over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap.

Failing to extend the TCJA could negatively impact Florida household budgets and economic growth.

If Congress doesn’t act by the end of this year, Florida taxpayers will face smaller paychecks and a more complicated tax filing process next year.

That’s why it’s crucial for President Donald Trump and Congress to renew the tax cuts now through One Big Beautiful Bill.

Passage will be a huge win for Floridians.

Even though the Sunshine State doesn’t impose a state income tax, residents still pay federal income tax. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) cut income tax rates for most Americans, delivering an average savings of $2,100 for Florida taxpayers.

But if that law expires, Floridians will have to tack on an average increase of $3,650 to their federal taxes because of higher tax rates, a reduced standard deduction, and a smaller child tax credit.

Thankfully, the House has given first round approval to One Big Beautiful Bill that extends many of the TCJA’s provisions permanently. But there’s still a long way to go. The bill is now with the Senate, which has the chance to make it a better deal for taxpayers.

One of the biggest threats to the bill is the push from some lawmakers to eliminate the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. That cap limits how much in state and local taxes high-income households can deduct from their federal tax bill. Raising the cap would be a massive giveaway to poorly run high-tax states like New York and California.

New York, for instance, spends more than twice as much as Florida on a per person basis. Floridians should not bail them out for their fiscal mismanagement. States should have to fix this mess on their own, which is why the Senate should not blow open current limits on the SALT deduction. Even better, they should kill the SALT deduction altogether.

The Senate should also make other improvements to strengthen the bill and put our country’s finances on a more solid future footing.

First, it’s time to repeal the costly and regressive green energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. These provisions would cost taxpayers up to $1 trillion over 10 years, and the Government Accountability Office has warned they carry a high risk of fraud because of their complexity and scale. Ending these subsidies now will free up resources for more widespread tax reform.

Second, we need meaningful Medicaid reform. The program is essential for people who are low income and disabled or pregnant. Unfortunately, it's riddled with waste and fraud. Improper payments cost taxpayers more than $30 billion each year, and some funds are being misused on items like gym memberships and music lessons, which are well beyond the program’s intent.

Congress should refocus Medicaid on serving those who need it most and crack down on practices that allow state governments to launder federal funds to pad their own budgets.

Finally, Congress should make permanent the TCJA’s cost recovery provisions, which allow businesses to deduct the cost of investments in equipment and research. These measures promote economic growth and job creation, especially in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. Making them permanent could more than double the economic growth from the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Florida families deserve to keep the lower taxes and simpler tax code they’ve relied on over the past several years. Letting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire would hit household budgets hard, drain dollars from local businesses, and put the brakes on economic growth.

The Senate has an opportunity to not only extend these tax cuts, but improve on them. That means rejecting costly carveouts like enlarging the SALT cap, repealing green energy subsidies that waste taxpayer money, reforming Medicaid to serve its true purpose, and making pro-growth provisions like full cost recovery permanent.

Congress must act now to protect families, fuel America’s economic engine, and cement a tax code that rewards ingenuity and investment, not loopholes.

NC Newsline

With much fanfare, EMPOWERment Inc., held a ribbon-cutting in April for P.E.A.C.H Apartments, a 10-unit affordable housing complex it developed for low-income residents unable to pay Chapel Hill’s high rents.

At the ribbon cutting, U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-NC) and other dignitaries praised the nonprofit for its vision and persistence in addressing a critical need for safe and affordable housing in the town that is home to UNC Chapel Hill, the flagship university of the state’s 17-campus UNC System.

Families were supposed to begin moving into apartments for tenants earning at or below 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI) the following month but it never happened. The anticipated move-ins were short circuited because Duke Energy Progress refused to run power to the apartments, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint EMPOWERment Inc., filed against the energy company with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

“We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment INC. “Our building is at risk and 10 families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 30 percent AMI for the Durham-Chapel Hill HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area is $22,250 for a family of one, $25,400 for a family of two, $28,600 for a family of three and $31,750 for a family of four.

Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels installed to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments. The nonprofit’s contractors submitted plans for the single meter in July 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October 2024, Bailey said, but the power company didn’t notify the nonprofit that it wouldn’t provide service until February 2025.

The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.

“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”

EMPOWERment Inc., asked the state Utilities Commission for the following relief:

Require Duke connect electric service to EMPOWERment’s PEACH Apartments immediately, while the commission considers this Emergency Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling, to prevent the risk of irreparable harm and health risks from the lack of essential electric service.

Order that Duke permit the use of “master” meters when the lease between landlord and tenant states that the cost of electric and/or gas utilities is included in rental payments, as set forth in G. S. § 143-151. 42(b)(2).

In the alternative, declare that a multifamily residential building is eligible to use a single “master” meter, with the commission’s approval, when served by a solar array.

Require Duke to provide permanent electric service to the PEACH Apartments under the current single-meter configuration.

At issue in the disagreement is state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.

Bailey told NC Newsline that the energy utility would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.

To rewire the units so that each has a meter would cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said.

“We don’t have that,” she said. “We don’t have that laying around somewhere.”

Bailey said it would take to three to six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route.

“My apartments are 85 percent done,” Bailey said. “I can’t have them sitting around for six months without an air conditioning to control the humidity in North Carolina. When it rains like it does and it gets hot like it does, I’m inviting mold issues.”

Duke Energy said it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide this statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks: “Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”

The nonprofit was unable to convince Duke Energy to allow the single meter to be used temporarily so families could move in while parts to rewire the building were ordered, Bailey said.

Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said. Target tenants earn between $11 and $16 an hour, Bailey said, and have been anxiously awaiting news about when they can move into the new apartments.

“EMPOWERment Inc., is a small nonprofit trying to do the right thing for all the right reasons,” Bailey said. “Thirty-percent and below [AMI] income are people like your grocery store baggers or your assistant teacher or the people who take your tickets at the movie theater — that’s who we’re working for.”

For the fewer than a hundred people that make up the entire population of Port Heiden, Alaska, fishing provides both a paycheck and a full dinner plate. Every summer, residents of the Alutiiq village set out on commercial boats to catch salmon swimming upstream in the nearby rivers of Bristol Bay.

John Christensen, Port Heiden’s tribal president, is currently making preparations for the annual trek. In a week’s time, he and his 17-year-old son will charter Queen Ann, the family’s 32-foot boat, eight hours north to brave some of the planet’s highest tides, extreme weather risks, and other treacherous conditions. The two will keep at it until August, hauling in thousands of pounds of fish each day that they later sell to seafood processing companies. It’s grueling work that burns a considerable amount of costly fossil fuel energy, and there are scarcely any other options.

Because of their location, diesel costs almost four times the national average—the Alaska Native community spent $900,000 on fuel in 2024 alone. Even Port Heiden’s diesel storage tanks are posing challenges. Coastal erosion has created a growing threat of leaks in the structures, which are damaging to the environment and expensive to repair, and forced the tribe to relocate them further inland. On top of it all, of course, diesel generators contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and are notoriously noisy.

“Everything costs more. Electricity goes up, diesel goes up, every year. And wages don’t,” Christensen said. “We live on the edge of the world. And it’s just tough.”

In 2015, the community built a fish processing plant that the tribe collectively owns; they envisioned a scenario in which tribal members would not need to share revenue with processing companies, would bring home considerably more money, and wouldn’t have to spend months at a time away from their families. But the building has remained nonoperational for an entire decade because they simply can’t afford to power it.

Enormous amounts of diesel are needed, says Christensen, to run the filleting and gutting machines, separators and grinders, washing and scaling equipment, and even to store the sheer amount of fish the village catches every summer in freezers and refrigerators. They can already barely scrape together the budget needed to pay for the diesel that powers their boats, institutions, homes, and airport.

The onslaught of energy challenges that Port Heiden is facing, Christensen says, is linked to a corresponding population decline. Their fight for energy independence is a byproduct of colonial policies that have limited the resources and recourse that Alaska Native tribes like theirs have. “Power is 90 percent of the problem,” said Christensen. “Lack of people is the rest. But cheaper power would bring in more people.”

In 2023, Climate United, a national investment fund and coalition, submitted a proposal to participate in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, or GGRF—a $27 billion investment from the Inflation Reduction Act administered by the Environmental Protection Agency to “mobilize financing and private capital to address the climate crisis.” Last April, the EPA announced it had chosen three organizations to disseminate the program’s funding; $6.97 billion was designated to go to Climate United.

Then, in the course of President Donald Trump’s sweeping federal disinvestment campaign, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was singled out as a poster child for what Trump’s EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed was “criminal.”

“The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,” Zeldin said in February. He then endeavored on a crusade to get the money back. As the financial manager for GGRF, Citibank, the country’s third-largest financial institution, got caught in the middle.

The New York Times reported that investigations into Biden officials’ actions in creating the program and disbursing the funds had not found any “meaningful evidence” of criminal wrongdoing.

On March 4, Zeldin announced that the GGRF funding intended to go to Climate United and seven other organizations had been frozen. The following week, Climate United filed a joint lawsuit against the EPA, which they followed with a motion for a temporary restraining order against Zeldin, the EPA, and Citibank from taking actions to implement the termination of the grants. On March 11, the EPA sent Climate United a letter of funding termination. In April, a federal DC district judge ruled that the EPA had terminated the grants unlawfully and blocked the EPA from clawing them back. The Trump administration then appealed the decision.

Climate United is still awaiting the outcome of that appeal. While they do, the $6.97 billion remains inaccessible.

Climate United’s money was intended to support a range of projects from Hawai’i to the East Coast, everything from utility-scale solar to energy-efficient community centers—and a renewable energy initiative in Port Heiden. The coalition had earmarked $6 million for the first round of a pre-development grant program aimed at nearly two dozen Native communities looking to adopt or expand renewable energy power sources.

“We made investments in those communities, and we don’t have the capital to support those projects,” said Climate United’s Chief Community Officer Krystal Langholz.

In response to an inquiry from Grist, an EPA spokesperson noted that “Unlike the Biden-Haris administration, this EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars.” The spokesperson said that Zeldin had terminated $20 billion in grant agreements because of “substantial concerns regarding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program integrity, the award process, and programmatic waste and abuse, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

A representative of Citibank declined to comment. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service did not respond to requests for comment.

Long before most others recognized climate change as an urgent existential crisis, the Alutiiq peoples of what is now known as Port Heiden, but was once called Meshik, were forced to relocate because of rising seawater. With its pumice-rich volcanic soils and exposed location on the peninsula that divides Bristol Bay from the Gulf of Alaska, the area is unusually vulnerable to tidal forces that erode land rapidly during storms. Beginning in 1981, disappearing sea ice engulfed buildings and homes.

The community eventually moved their village about a 10-minute drive further inland. No one lives at the old site anymore, but important structures still remain, including a safe harbor for fishing boats.

The seas, of course, are still rising, creeping up to steal the land from right below the community’s feet. In a region that’s warming faster than just about any other place on the planet, much of the land is on the precipice of being swallowed by water. From 2017 to 2018, the old site lost between 35 and 65 feet of shoreline, as reported by the Bristol Bay Times. Even the local school situated on the newer site is affected by the shrinking shoreline—the institution and surrounding Alutiiq village increasingly threatened by the encroaching sea.

Before the Trump administration moved to terminate their funding, Christensen’s dream of transitioning the Port Heiden community to renewable sources of energy, consequential for both maintaining its traditional lifestyle and ensuring its future, had briefly seemed within reach. He also saw it as a way to contribute to global solutions to the climate crisis.

“I don’t think [we are] the biggest contributor to global pollution, but if we could do our part and not pollute, maybe we won’t erode as fast,” he said. “I know we’re not very many people, but to us, that’s our community.”

The tribe planned to use a $300,000 grant from Climate United to pay for the topographic and waterway studies needed to design two run-of-the-river hydropower plants. In theory, the systems, which divert a portion of flowing water through turbines, would generate enough clean energy to power the entirety of Port Heiden, including the idle fish-processing facility. The community also envisioned channeling hydropower to run a local greenhouse, where they could expand what crops they raise and the growing season, further boosting local food access and sovereignty.

In even that short period of whiplash—from being awarded the grant to watching it vanish—the village’s needs have become increasingly urgent. Meeting the skyrocketing cost of diesel, according to Christensen, is no longer feasible. The community’s energy crisis and ensuing cost of living struggle have already started prompting an exodus, with the population declining at a rate of little over 3 percent every year—a noticeable loss when the town’s number rarely exceeds a hundred residents to begin with.

“It’s really expensive to live out here. And I don’t plan on moving anytime soon. And my kids, they don’t want to go either. So I have to make it better, make it easier to live here,” Christensen said.

Janine Bloomfield, grants specialist at 10Power, the organization that Port Heiden partnered with to help write their grant application, said they are currently waiting for a decision to be made in the lawsuit “that may lead to the money being unfrozen.” In the interim, she said, recipients have been asked to work with Climate United on paperwork “to be able to react quickly in the event that the funds are released.”

For its part, Climate United is also now exploring other funding strategies. The coalition is rehauling the structure of the money going to Port Heiden and other Native communities. Rather than awarding it as a grant, where recipients would have to pay the costs upfront and be reimbursed later, Climate United will now issue loans to the communities originally selected for the pre-development grants that don’t require upfront costs and will be forgiven upon completion of the agreed-upon deliverables. Their reason for the transition, according to Langholz, was “to increase security, decrease administrative burden on our partners, and create credit-building opportunities while still providing strong programmatic oversight.”

Still, there are downsides to consider with any loan, including being stuck with debt. In many cases, said Chéri Smith, a Mi’Kmaq descendant who founded and leads the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, replacing a federal grant with a loan, even a forgivable one, “adds complexity and risk for Tribal governments.”

Forgivable loans “become a better option” in later stages of development or for income-generating infrastructure, said Smith, who is on the advisory board of Climate United, but are “rarely suitable for common pre-development needs.” That’s because pre-feasibility work, such as Port Heiden’s hydropower project, “is inherently speculative, and Tribes should not be expected to risk even conditional debt to validate whether their own resources can be developed.” This is especially true in Alaska, she added, where costs and logistical challenges are exponentially higher for the 229 federally recognized tribes than in the lower 48, and outcomes much less predictable.

Raina Thiele, Dena’ina Athabascan and Yup’ik, who formerly served in the Biden administration as senior adviser for Alaska affairs to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and former tribal liaison to President Obama, said the lending situation is particularly unique when it comes to Alaska Native communities, because of how Congress historically wrote legislation relating to a land claim settlement which saw tribes deprived of control over resources and land. Because of that, it’s been incredibly difficult for communities to build capacity, she noted, making even a forgivable loan “a bit of a high-risk endeavor.” The question of trust also shows up—the promise of loan forgiveness, in particular, is understandably difficult for communities who have long faced exploitation and discrimination in public and privatized lending programs. “Grant programs are a lot more familiar,” she said.

Even so, the loan from Climate United would only be possible if the court rules in its favor and compels the EPA to release the money. If the court rules against Climate United, Langholz told Grist, the organization could pursue damage claims in another court and may seek philanthropic fundraising to help Port Heiden come up with the $300,000, in addition to the rest of the $6 million promised to the nearly two dozen Native communities originally selected for the grant program.

“These cuts can be a matter of life or death for many of these communities being able to heat their homes, essentially,” said Thiele.

While many different stakeholders wait to see how the federal funding crisis will play out, Christensen doesn’t know what to make of the proposed grant-to-loan shift for Port Heiden’s hydropower project. The landscape has changed so quickly and drastically, it has, however, prompted him to lose what little faith he had left in federal funding. He has already begun to brainstorm other ways to ditch diesel.

“We’ll figure it out,” he said. “I’ll find the money if I have to. I’ll win the lottery, and spend the money on cheaper power.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lossy-page1-2652px-NORTH_SIDE_AND_WEST_FRONT_-_St._Matrona_Russian_Orthodox_Church_Port_Heiden_Lake_and_Peninsula_Borough_AK_HABS_AK5-POHEI1B-1.tif-1.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-15 12:11:51.482080

Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities from the world’s major tropical forest regions have released a powerful new declaration from their First Global Congress, held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. The declaration outlines urgent demands ahead of COP30 — including land rights, direct climate finance, and protection for environmental defenders — and calls for Indigenous leadership to be centered in global climate and biodiversity solutions.

Below are several quotes from the Congress:

“We are tired of false solutions and initiatives disconnected from our ways of life and the realities in our territories,” said Sonia Guajajara, Minister of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil. “The time has come to invest in innovative mechanisms that treat us as partners, not beneficiaries. The answer is us.”

“Countries must recognize historical injustices; it's important to enshrine this in a legal code,” said Albert K. Barume, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. “As an act of recognition and protection, the right to self-determination and traditional authorities must be recognized.”

“This Congress is historic because, for the first time, we have united as Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities from the world’s three great forest basins to defend our rights, our territories, our cultures, and our identities,” said Joseph Itongwa, coordinator of the The Network of Indigenous and Local Populations for the Sustainable Management of Forest Ecosystems in Central Africa (REPALEAC). “Even where laws are weak or unenforced, we see strong local commitment. We urge countries like the Republic of Congo and others in Central Africa that have ratified key conventions to put them into action — our rights must be recognized based on the evidence we have provided. We must continue working every day to secure legal recognition, the demarcation of our lands, and respect for our traditional knowledge, which protects the 50% of biodiversity that still remains intact.”

“This is not just about money; it is about friendship and solidarity. The answer is us. All of us,” said Rukka Sombolinggi, Secretary General of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) in Indonesia. “Let’s walk together and create a better funding environment for all Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. We have our mechanisms already, let’s test them out!”

“I believe this Congress will contribute to reinforcing the partnership between governments, donors, strategic allies, and the Indigenous People and Local Communities’ rights movement,” said Dr. Solange Bandiaky-Badji, Coordinator and President of the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI). “We have to work together; we have to work in partnership and to support one another, because ensuring Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities legal recognition will contribute to not just their prosperity but to peace and stability in all countries.”

That’s why clean energy, including solar, wind and battery storage, isn’t just an environmental imperative.
And despite the fears being stoked in Oakham and other towns, battery energy storage systems are a safe, tested and essential part of breaking free from fossil-fuel dependence and reducing energy costs for the average consumer.
Battery systems take clean, locally produced energy from offshore wind and solar farms and store it for later use, particularly during high-demand hours.
Battery storage must be part of it, and community engagement must be done right.","This past winter was one of the coldest Massachusetts has seen in a decade. It followed one of the hottest summers on record, and together, they delivered punishing energy bills to households across the commonwealth. As another summer looms with projections of a 30% spike in electricity demand, Massachusetts families have every right to ask: ""Why are my bills so high? And what can we do about it?""

Here’s the truth: The most significant reason our energy bills remain so volatile is our continued reliance on fossil fuels, an energy source that is dirty, expensive, unpredictable and exposed to global market shocks. When a cold snap hits New England or a heat wave strains the grid, we fall back on imported gas and oil. That drives up prices and deepens the cycle of pollution and vulnerability.

That’s why clean energy, including solar, wind and battery storage, isn’t just an environmental imperative. It’s an economic one. And despite the fears being stoked in Oakham and other towns, battery energy storage systems are a safe, tested and essential part of breaking free from fossil-fuel dependence and reducing energy costs for the average consumer.

Massachusetts law requires us to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To do this, we must reduce emissions and maintain a stable, reliable power grid. Storage is a key technology that allows us to do both. Battery systems take clean, locally produced energy from offshore wind and solar farms and store it for later use, particularly during high-demand hours. This reduces our dependence on “peaker plants” that burn fossil fuels and cost more to operate, and it buffers the grid against blackouts and price surges.

But instead of celebrating this progress, a familiar pattern is playing out: opposition campaigns rooted in fear and misinformation, amplified by social media and well-funded fossil fuel interests.

Let’s be honest: Every form of energy infrastructure carries some risk. Modern battery systems adhere to National Fire Protection Association standards and are built with advanced safety features like remote monitoring, thermal controls and strict setback requirements. The technology has improved dramatically from early-generation systems, and of the handful of highly publicized incidents we’ve seen in the past, most were tied to older or improperly maintained equipment.

Developers must comply with water safety standards regarding the proposed Oakham project, but blind opposition ignores the scientific advances that make hazard containment and mitigation achievable.

It’s important to acknowledge local concerns; they’re real. But there’s also a financial reality at play. Residents heating their homes with gas are already being saddled with the cost of fixing a $40 billion leaking pipeline network and a volatile energy market. That money is coming out of allour utility bills. The longer we delay this transition, the more we pay for the status quo that fossil fuel interests are so desperate to maintain.

So what’s the path forward?

Battery storage must be part of it, and community engagement must be done right. That means developers and state agencies must listen, communicate clearly and address concerns honestly. It also means our public discourse has to move beyond fear-mongering headlines and toward solutions rooted in facts, safety and shared responsibility. We cannot allow misinformation to dictate policy. The stakes are too high.

Clean energy paired with storage is the affordable choice. It’s the safer choice. And it’s the only path to an energy system that works for residents, businesses and families.

“My prayers have been answered,” she remembers thinking. For years, Parrish’s home had been in a state of disrepair. Her previous stove, the only way she had to warm her home during the winter, was cracked in the back, allowing smoke to fill the home. Water leaked from the roof. Her windows were broken, covered with a wooden board. A member of the Navajo Nation, she tried for years to get help from the tribal government, but none ever came.

Parrish was just one of thousands of homeowners across the Hopi and Navajo nations in the Four Corners region living in unsafe housing conditions. For decades, families across the region have relied on older coal- or wood-burning stoves to heat their homes. But those stoves can emit high levels of particulate matter and smoke, a major cause of the two reservations’ high levels of respiratory illness, far exceeding the U.S. average.

In November, her stove, windows and roof were finally replaced and fixed, a beneficiary of surging federal funding from the Biden administration to Red Feather Development Group, a Flagstaff-based nonprofit. But now the funding to continue this work is in question as President Donald Trump and his administration slash funding across the government.

Red Feather is dedicated to improving housing conditions on the Hopi and Navajo nations in the Four Corners region. It has helped thousands of families with stove replacement, heat pump installation and weatherization assistance. The group has been doing this work for decades, but in recent years, it has seen a surge in work, in part due to increased funding from the federal government.

A big part of that funding, a $500,000 environmental justice grant Red Feather received from the Environmental Protection Agency, has now been terminated.

Red Feather is just one of hundreds of groups that have had grants meant to help disadvantaged communities canceled by the Trump administration. An Inside Climate News analysis, which relied on federal government spending data and federal court filings from the Trump administration, found the EPA’s grant terminations focused almost entirely on cutting spending on poor and minority communities, affecting 384 primary grants worth more than $2.4 billion.

“At the end of the day, we’re about solutions,” said Joe Seidenberg, Red Feather’s executive director. “And the solutions we’re advancing—clean heating, affordable energy, local workforce development—deliver real value, no matter who’s in office.”

The $500,000 EPA grant was an environmental justice collaborative problem-solving grant focused on promoting the safe use of firewood for house warming on the Hopi and Navajo reservations. That funding was to provide classes to community members on installing efficient and EPA-certified wood stoves and educate attendees on air quality issues. It was to give out $1,000 apiece to 70 households to help heat their homes and provide payroll to Red Feather to support the work.

The grant was one part of surging investment from the federal government. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Navajo Nation had one of the highest per-capita number of cases in the country. In large part, those infections and deaths stemmed from underlying chronic health issues and a historical lack of federal investment in the reservation.

Funding soon flowed into groups like Red Feather to address these health challenges, thanks to new laws such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Red Feather’s budget grew 300 percent, its staff increased from five full-time employees to 12, with roughly 75 percent of their budget coming from the federal government.

Red Feather received a first round of funding of $400,000 from the Department of Energy’s Building Upgrades Inspiring Local Transformation. That funding was unrestricted—meaning it could be used for anything, something nearly unheard of in the nonprofit world—and there were set to be three more rounds of that funding.

The EPA grant was the next major federal investment Red Feather was set to receive, and the nonprofit was optimistic it would continue to get other grants stemming from laws passed during the Biden administration.

No notice was ever given as to why exactly the EPA grant was terminated, Seidenberg said, but it appears since the grant was under an environmental justice initiative, the work was lumped in under diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that have been the subject of attack by the Trump administration.

“Diversity doesn’t need to be a politically loaded word, even though it’s become one,” he said. “We believe that building bridges is the only path forward, even when it feels like no bridges can be built in an increasingly divided world, we choose collaboration over conflict, healing over polarization. Our work is not about taking sides. It’s about standing with communities.”

Decades of federal underinvestment, rising energy costs and high unemployment rates combined with the remote geographies have left many Navajo and Hopi families unable to fix and upgrade their homes, Seidenberg said.

The two communities have high energy burdens, he explained at Red Feather’s Flagstaff office, referring to the amount of money a homeowner needs to pay to heat and cool a house.

For years, many Navajo and Hopi families relied on coal-burning stoves to generate heat in the winter; most homes had no cooling in the summer, when temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Families, however, were forced to shift from coal in 2019, when the Navajo Generating Station shut down. The plant gave out coal cards to families who would drive from across the region to get the coal needed for their stoves. But when coal became economically unviable, APS, the utility operating the power plant, closed it down in 2019.

“Environmental groups cheered. A lot of tribal members cheered,” Seidenberg said. “But not all.”

Hundreds of jobs were lost—as was a primary way families kept their homes warm in the winter. Many families have turned to burning wood in their stoves. But decades of burning coal in those wood stoves can be detrimental to the system. If rain got in and mixed with coal dust, it turned to sulfuric acid and corroded chimney pipes. The result was a worsening of an already hazardous situation, considering that a stove that hasn’t been certified as meeting EPA standards can emit as much pollution as seven diesel buses.

If families aren’t using stoves, they’re likely using propane or electric space heaters. Those heating methods—often the only available options for many families— can lead to air quality issues in households. Some families using propane don’t have outdoor ventilation for the heating, which can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. Electric space heaters are a leading cause of house fires.

EPA-certified wood stoves are cleaner and more energy efficient. They also provide jobs to supply wood, Seidenberg said. It’s helping to clear forests and reduce the threats of wildfires, he said, while also being American-made energy—a top priority of the Trump administration.

Federal Funding Major Aid to Community

Red Feather started in 1995, named after the first woman they helped: Katherine Red Feather. The organization started by building straw-bale houses for families in need. But for years, Red Feather was only able to build about two homes a year. The homes were highly subsidized, but still required a loan, a challenge for many families on the reservations.

Thousands of homes across the Hopi and Navajo nations were still in disrepair, leading the organization to shift focus to improving the status of existing homes. Many had leaking and damaged roofs, broken windows—both hurting a home’s energy efficiency, making it harder to cool or heat—and many homes had unhealthy heating methods and a complete lack of cooling for the summers.

The organization was able to scale up the number of families it could assist, while also creating classes to teach families do-it-yourself methods to fix issues at their homes.

Since 2021, when federal funding began to flow to Red Feather, the nonprofit has assisted more than 6,500 individuals across the Navajo and Hopi communities via various programs.

Over 300 stoves have been replaced with EPA-certified ones that burn cleaner and consume less fuel—a big benefit, given cords of wood can cost thousands of dollars over the course of a year. More than 1,000 individuals have had repairs made at their homes. And over 60 people have had heat pumps installed, a newer service Red Feather has begun to offer.

A Changing Community

Red Feather’s surging budget came at a time of change on the Navajo Nation.

In Tuba City, the Navajo Nation’s largest community and where Parrish lives, there is potential for development that didn’t exist before. This follows a decades-long period when there was almost no new building, a result of a federal policy called the Bennett Freeze. The freeze was put in place in 1966 over a land dispute between the Navajo and the Hopi and lasted until 2009.

But no money came with the end of the freeze, and tensions remained between the two tribal governments. To this day, only 24 percent of the houses in the Bennett freeze area are habitable, almost 60 percent do not have electricity and the majority do not have access to potable running water, according to the Navajo government.

Now, over a decade since the freeze ended, change is coming rapidly to this corner of the reservation, said Duane Tsinigine, a program coordinator with Red Feather living in Tuba City. New developments are coming into Tuba City and the surrounding areas, and houses are being updated, in large part due to Red Feather. He spends his days meeting with locals across the two reservations to evaluate their homes.

Locals like Carol Parrish typically hear about Red Feather through word of mouth. They submit applications to Red Feather, which are processed and evaluated to see who qualifies for help. From there, coordinators like Tsinigine visit their homes for an evaluation of the services needed.

“We were never taught what energy efficiency means,” said Tsinigine, referring to homeowners on the reservations. So he explains it the best he can: It means they’ll save money and their homes will be better off.

Parrish’s home now has windows that work, allowing sunlight to come in. She no longer has to put out a bucket to collect the rainwater that would leak from her roof. And, at 90 years old with asthma, she breathes easier thanks to her new stove.

Across the highway in Tuba City, on the Hopi side called Moenkopi, Susan Blackhair, a member of the Hopi Tribe, no longer has to rely on her old stove or propane heater to warm her home. Red Feather installed a heat pump, able to transfer hot air for cold air or vice versa. It’s much better, she says, and her home finally can get cool in the summer. At her home, Tsinigine told Blackfeather to get back in touch with Red Feather at the end of the year, where she could put in a new application to fix her windows.

The grant termination is disappointing, Seidenberg said, but it won’t stop Red Feather’s work. They have partnerships and funding from the two tribal governments, local counties and other philanthropic organizations, and their goal is to continue developing those relationships.

“Federal priorities shift as administrations change—that’s the nature of democracy,” Seidenberg said. “We’re not here to criticize those changes. Our focus is on finding the most constructive path forward, one that aligns with the goals of the moment and meets the real needs of tribal families.”

The Investment Tax Credit has made solar more accessible by letting homeowners claim 30% of installation costs on their federal taxes. Originally set to phase out over the next decade, a new House proposal would end it as soon as this year. For people like Madden, that could mean layoffs and business closures. ""With a wholesale removal of the residential tax credit,"" he says, ""we'd be laying off a lot of guys and we would have a trickle of the work we're used to.""

While some lawmakers argue the incentive mainly helps wealthier homeowners, data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that more low- and middle-income families have been installing solar in recent years thanks to incentives like the ITC.

Congress has signaled it may eliminate the tax credit as soon as the end of this year, cutting the timeline nearly a decade short. If passed, homeowners would need to complete installations by the end of this year to receive the 30% credit.

The tax credit's future is still uncertain, but if it does go away, it could mean losing out on thousands of dollars in savings. According to EnergySage, homeowners typically save close to $10,000 when incentives are factored in. The platform also offers a mapping tool that shows average solar costs and available incentives by state, helping people figure out what kind of deal they could get.

KUCHING, June 15: Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg says the State’s economic policy now needs to focus on its existing strengths, particularly the production of clean and sustainable energy.

According to a report by Sarawak Public Communication Unit (Ukas), he highlighted that developed countries are now choosing to use hydrogen as part of their energy sources, and Sarawak is capable of producing hydrogen through water and methane sources.

“Energy is our strength not only for exports, but also from an industrial point of view because if they (investors) want to produce any product, they need energy.

“If our energy tariffs are competitive and our energy is sustainable, investors will bring their capital here,” Abang Johari said in his address during Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sarawak’s (ACCCIS) 60th Anniversary Gala Dinner last night.

With Sarawak accelerating its green economy, particularly through the development of its hydrogen sector, the Premier called on ACCCIS to be ready to engage in strategic partnerships with international investors in both the manufacturing and energy sectors.

He further lauded the Chambers for its long-standing contributions to Sarawak’s development, describing ACCCIS as a steadfast partner and a key economic engine for the State’s evolution from a timber-based economy to one transitioning to renewable energy.

“Through synergistic efforts between the Sarawak government and ACCCIS, we have successfully secured manufacturing investments from Japan, the US, and Europe,” he said.

“For that reason, ACCCIS can work with investors while we on the government side will assist your initiatives to produce products in Sarawak.

“Actually, now, opportunities are knocking on our door so I hope ACCCIS can work with you because when the opportunity comes, I will call you to discuss with them.

“That’s where joint ventures can be created, and the Sarawak government will facilitate,” he added. – DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/506444546_1294905935970029_2413770753491291822_n-e1749969916233.jpg?fit=800%2C533&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-15 09:01:45.536420

More cars and charging stations are expected to have plug-and-charge capability in the coming months.
But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.
In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2% or 3% when only Tesla cars charged there.","Since Tesla installed its first Superchargers in 2012 for the exclusive use of its customers, owners of other electric cars have often felt like second-class citizens. They have wandered in search of electric oases in desolate parking lots, often making desperate calls to help centers after becoming stymied by balky or broken chargers.

It’s no surprise, then, that consumers rank problems with public electric vehicle charging and the time it takes to fuel up as their top two reasons for rejecting electric vehicles, according to J.D. Power.

But help may finally be at hand.

Automakers and charging companies are building new stations and updating their cars to allow drivers to more easily and quickly recharge their vehicles. They are also outfitting charging stations with more amenities such as food and bathrooms while making the devices more reliable. And because chargers are only as fast as the cars they connect with, automakers are designing new cars to absorb electricity at Usain Bolt-level speeds. In addition, many automakers have cut deals with Tesla allowing owners of other cars access to the company’s fast-charging network, the largest in the country and widely considered the most reliable.

There is early evidence that efforts to improve electric vehicle charging are paying off.

In recent years, J.D. Power surveys showed that about 20% of attempts to charge electric vehicles at all public stations ended in failure because of faulty chargers, long lines or payment glitches. But in the first three months of 2025, overall failure rates fell to 16%, the biggest improvement since the surveys began in 2021.

“The industry is finally elevating as a whole,” said Brent Gruber, an executive director at J.D. Power.

The number of chargers has also increased. There were about 55,200 fast chargers in the United States in May, up from 42,200 a year earlier, according to federal data.

In February, a former Phillips 66 gas station in Apex, North Carolina, near Raleigh, became the first Rechargery from Ionna, a company created by eight automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai Motors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Their chargers can deliver up to 400 kilowatts of juice, far more than Tesla’s 250-kilowatt Superchargers. Some cars can replenish a battery in 30 minutes or less at the higher charging speeds.

When connected to chargers of 350 kilowatts or more, including those at Ionna and Electrify America, another fast-charging network, a Hyundai Ioniq 5, for example, can fill its electric “tank” from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes. That adds up to 220 miles of driving range, enough for more than three hours of highway cruising. That’s quick enough to keep a road trip on schedule and the family refreshed.

Ionna stations offer 24-hour service. The network has installed lighted canopies over chargers, and drivers can wait in lounges equipped with Wi-Fi, coffee bars and bathrooms while their vehicles are plugged in.

Seth Cutler, Ionna’s CEO, said the stations seek to transform an experience that many electric drivers dread. Public chargers are sometimes installed in sketchy places, including beside dumpsters in shopping malls and in dingy parking lots with no bathrooms or refreshments nearby.

“Charging an EV takes a little time, so this is a place somebody might actually want to be in the middle of the night, and there’s something to do while they’re there,” Cutler said. “People definitely don’t want to be somewhere that feels unclean or unsafe.”

Ionna aims to install 10 to 12 fast-charging stalls per station. Chargers can connect directly to Teslas and vehicles that use the Combined Charging System plug, which is used by most other automakers. Since February, Ionna has opened 14 stations in several states and has acquired 200 sites around the country. Its target is to build 30,000 charging bays by 2030.

Some models from BMW, Hyundai and Kia have also enabled a national “Plug and Charge” standard that lets car owners begin charging their vehicles at Ionna stalls without first having to use a smartphone app or swipe a credit card, eliminating a cumbersome step that sometimes results in errors. Tesla’s chargers have long worked this way for Tesla cars and now work with some other vehicles, like Rivian’s SUVs and pickups.

More cars and charging stations are expected to have plug-and-charge capability in the coming months.

Gas stations and restaurants have also improved their charging game. Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based gas chain that is famous for its sprawling stores and myriad food options, is working with Mercedes to offer “premium” charging that is powered by renewable energy. Waffle House plans to begin installing BP Pulse fast chargers next year. And GM and EVgo, a charging company, are building 500 stations with 2,000 stalls at Pilot and Flying J travel centers.

Olabisi Boyle, an Ionna board member and Hyundai’s senior vice president of product and mobility, said her company and other automakers were committed to improving access to charging. Automakers have realized that “EV charging wasn’t just a thing you did on the side,” Boyle said. “It’s the future of the customer experience.”

But that doesn’t mean the complications and problems will easily be dispensed with, especially when it comes to making cars and chargers play nicely with each other.

Nearly every major automaker is redesigning their cars with plug outlets and software that are compatible with Tesla chargers. The North American Charging Standard, developed by Tesla, offers a further advantage of slimmer, lighter handles that are easier to plug into cars, including for seniors or people with disabilities. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs are shipping with those ports from a new factory in Georgia. But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.

Compatibility issues between cars and chargers that use different charging standards have begun to show up in surveys about how many charging sessions end badly. In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2% or 3% when only Tesla cars charged there.

But since the automaker opened its chargers to cars from other brands, that rate has risen to 7%, according to J.D. Power. Gruber noted that those failure rates included drivers who gave up after encountering lines at chargers. Some Tesla drivers have expressed unhappiness at having to share chargers with other car brands.

Rajiv Diwan, who helped spearhead a charger rollout for the New York Power Authority, called the industry’s coalescing around Tesla’s plug standard “a great move for the American market.” But Diwan said other charging competitors did not appear to be moving fast enough to build stations to meet rising demand. He said the companies were often hamstrung by onerous construction and electricity costs and bureaucratic delays.

“The industry always sugarcoats things, but charging is still hard for the average person to understand and deal with,” he said. “People just want to get from Point A to Point B with as little fuss as possible, and that’s not happening yet.”

Momentum may also be short-circuited by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, who have proposed repealing many federal incentives for electric cars and trucks. The administration has also stopped issuing grants to states to help build chargers under the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program created during the Biden administration.

“When we needed the whole ecosystem to come together and organize around NEVI, it’s all been blown to bits,” said Chris Nelder, an infrastructure expert and host of “The Energy Transition Show,” a podcast.

Gruber of J.D. Power said the federal charger grant program helped construct only a tiny fraction of new chargers. But the program was helpful in other ways. It published guidelines that helped automakers and charging companies work together and address technical problems.

For the foreseeable future, Gruber said, the auto industry and state governments that care about addressing climate change will have to take the lead on getting more chargers built and improving their performance.

“There’s no doubt EVs are still the vehicle of the future,” he said, “and I think the private sector will carry that torch forward.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/eeL0pi-8b2USqGCoXr1koJByQ3o=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/12/684b4bf416b62.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 04:01:55.523703

For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income.
“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said.
“It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets.","Texas farmers continue to find ways to add value to their operations through alternative crops like oilseeds and cover crop forages.

Calvin Trostle, Ph.D.,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service agronomist and statewide hemp and alternative crop specialist, Lubbock, said markets may be limited for alternative crops like sunflowers, sesame, Sudan grass and canola, but Texas producers are taking advantage of cropping opportunities.

For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income. They can also provide the benefits of a cover crop during the cool season.

“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said. “But for producers looking for opportunities to supplement their primary crop production, they can really be a value-added component.”

Sunflowers show potential

Trostle said total acres for sunflowers in the Rio Grande Valley increased slightly but remained static in other regions of the state. Growers typically engage with buyers before acres are planted to fill contracts at set prices. Seeds are grown for two markets – as bird food and for oil extraction.

Per pound prices were good for both markets, he said. Seeds bound for “crushing” end up in oil form for various products, but primarily for cooking, especially in large-scale food manufacturing.

Sunflower seeds’ high-oleic content makes them more shelf-stable and better for cooking and frying, but their monounsaturated fats retain healthy attributes, he said.

Trostle said there may be growth potential in the demand for crushing-seeds for oil but the demand for them as bird food remained steady.

“Sunflowers seem to provide some price security and safety for growers, and it has the potential for premiums based on oil content,” he said. “It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets. That’s why we recommend growers dedicate some acres each season to experiment with growing options that might have potential for their operation.”

Finding markets for alternative crops

Production capacity in other alternative crops slipped or made gains based on regional demands, Trostle said.

Sesame seed acres remained close to last year, but demand dropped when a contractor pulled out of the Texas market, he said. As a result, prices have not been strong enough to generate interest in expansion among producers. It remains an alternative crop that is on a contract basis and filled by established growers.

Canola for oil production also experienced a decline in demand, even in surrounding states like Oklahoma, as acres moved to other states, Trostle said. However, some growers are finding a market for the cool-season crop as a high-value forage for dairy production in the Panhandle. Canola is a brassica, which are fast-growing, high yielding forage and cover crops, and its silage’s high nutritive value outperforms grasses like wheat and ryegrass.

Trostle said wheat, triticale and Sudan grass, which is a forage sorghum variety, have generated increased interest among producers. They are seeing the harvest and post-harvest value in these cool-season crops.

They can be grazed or grown as forage but also provide excellent cover-crop residue for growers who might follow with cotton or other warm-season commodities.

Trostle saidTexas A&M AgriLife Research and AgriLife Extension scientists continue to research the versatility of these cool-season options and provide valuable information and recommendations to growers.

“A new major educational effort for me this year is the advent of prussic acid-free sorghums,” he said. “There are first-time sorghum/Sudan hybrids that eliminate prussic acid poisoning in stressed or frostbitten sorghums.”

Trostle said that for now, those seeds cost more, and there are first-year limited seed supplies.",http://www.ntxe-news.com/images/icons/fb_logo.gif,N,,2025-06-15 04:59:14.995175

Technology and Manufacturing Capabilities First Solar continues to invest in its technological capabilities and manufacturing capacity.
First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market.","First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), the largest US-based solar module manufacturer with a market capitalization of $18.8 billion, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of tariffs, technological advancements, and policy uncertainties. The company’s unique position as a domestic producer with proprietary technology has garnered significant attention from investors and analysts alike, particularly given its strong financial health. According to InvestingPro data, First Solar maintains robust liquidity with a current ratio of 1.93 and operates with minimal leverage, sporting a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.08.

Market Position and Competitive Advantages

First Solar has established itself as a leader in the US solar market, benefiting from its strong domestic manufacturing footprint and the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company specializes in cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar panels, which differ from the more common silicon-based panels produced by many of its competitors.

One of First Solar’s key competitive advantages lies in its proprietary technology, particularly its advancements in TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) technology. Analysts note that this gives the company a significant edge over other US cell manufacturers who are limited to using less efficient PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology. This technological moat has allowed First Solar to maintain stronger pricing power and potentially higher margins compared to its peers.

Tariff Impacts and Policy Uncertainties

The solar industry has been significantly impacted by recent trade policies, particularly the imposition of tariffs on imported solar modules. For First Solar, this presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, the company benefits from its domestic production capabilities, which shield it from the full impact of these tariffs. On the other hand, the broader market uncertainty created by these policies has led to some hesitation among customers and potential project delays.

In April 2025, the US Department of Commerce made final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on crystalline photovoltaic cells from several Southeast Asian countries. The resulting tariffs, with an all-in weighted average rate of approximately 330%, have created a complex competitive landscape. While these tariffs potentially benefit First Solar by increasing the costs for its foreign competitors, they also introduce uncertainty into the broader solar market.

First Solar’s management has indicated that the company’s contracts are structured to avoid directly absorbing tariff costs. However, the potential for reciprocal tariffs on its facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia poses a long-term challenge. Analysts estimate that First Solar would need to increase its average selling price (ASP) by approximately $0.02/watt to offset the tariff impact, which is significantly less than what its competitors would need to do.

Technology and Manufacturing Capabilities

First Solar continues to invest in its technological capabilities and manufacturing capacity. The company has begun limited commercial production of its CuRe ( Replacement) modules at its Ohio facility, with full deployment expected after testing. Additionally, First Solar is working on perovskites technology and a next-generation tandem device, which could further enhance its competitive position in the future.

The company plans to achieve 25 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity by 2026, with expansion plans in India, Alabama, Louisiana, and Ohio. This growth in capacity is expected to drive future revenue and potentially improve economies of scale.

However, First Solar has faced some challenges with its Series 7 modules, which have experienced manufacturing issues. While the company reports that these issues have been resolved for current production, there is a potential for warranty losses of up to $100 million related to previously produced modules.

Financial Outlook and Guidance

First Solar’s financial performance and guidance have been subject to significant scrutiny in recent months. In its latest earnings report, the company exceeded revenue expectations but missed gross margin targets due to various factors, including IRA credit sales, warranty charges, module shipment delays, and increased warehousing costs.

For fiscal year 2025, First Solar has revised its guidance downward, reflecting the uncertainties in the market. The company now expects revenue in the range of $4.5-5.5 billion, down from the previous guidance of $5.3-5.8 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) guidance has been reduced to $12.50-17.50 from the previous $17-20 range. Despite these adjustments, InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation with a P/E ratio of 14.94, which appears modest given the company’s growth trajectory and robust gross margin of 43.61%.

Despite these near-term challenges, analysts remain generally optimistic about First Solar’s long-term prospects. The company’s strong backlog, which extends through 2030, provides significant visibility into future revenues. Additionally, the potential for stable or increasing ASPs, even in the face of potential changes to tax credits and tariffs, supports a positive outlook for profitability.

Bear Case

How might changes to IRA provisions impact First Solar’s competitive advantage?

First Solar’s current competitive position is significantly bolstered by the incentives provided under the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly the 45X manufacturing tax credits. If these provisions were to be altered or eliminated under a future administration, it could substantially impact First Solar’s cost structure and profitability.

The company’s earnings are heavily tied to these credits, with some analysts estimating that they contribute significantly to the EPS forecast. A phase-out or removal of these credits could lead to a sharp decline in profitability, potentially eroding First Solar’s competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers who operate with lower cost structures.

Furthermore, any changes to the domestic content requirements for solar projects eligible for tax credits could reduce the demand for First Solar’s US-made panels, potentially leading to overcapacity and margin pressure.

What risks does First Solar face from potential supply chain disruptions?

First Solar’s reliance on specific materials, particularly tellurium for its CdTe panels, exposes the company to supply chain risks. Recent export controls imposed by China on tellurium have highlighted this vulnerability. While First Solar is taking steps to diversify its sourcing to countries like Peru and Canada, this transition could lead to increased costs and potential production disruptions in the near term.

Additionally, the company’s global manufacturing footprint, with facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia, exposes it to geopolitical risks and potential trade disputes. Any disruptions to production or increased costs due to tariffs or trade barriers could negatively impact First Solar’s ability to meet demand and maintain its competitive pricing.

Bull Case

How could First Solar’s technological edge in CdTe and TOPCon panels drive future growth?

First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market. These technologies offer higher efficiency and potentially lower production costs compared to traditional silicon-based panels.

As the solar industry continues to grow and demand for high-efficiency panels increases, First Solar’s technological edge could allow it to capture a larger market share and command premium pricing. The company’s ongoing research into perovskites and next-generation tandem devices could further extend this technological lead, potentially opening up new market segments and applications for its products.

Moreover, as environmental concerns become increasingly important to consumers and policymakers, First Solar’s CdTe technology, which has a lower carbon footprint and energy payback time compared to silicon-based panels, could become even more attractive in the market.

What opportunities does First Solar have to expand its market share domestically and internationally?

First Solar’s strong position in the US market, combined with its planned capacity expansions, positions the company well to capitalize on the growing demand for solar energy. The company’s domestic manufacturing capabilities align well with the increasing focus on ""Made in America"" products and energy security concerns.

Internationally, First Solar has opportunities to expand its presence in growing markets such as India and the Middle East. The company’s plans to establish manufacturing facilities in India could allow it to tap into one of the world’s fastest-growing solar markets while potentially benefiting from local incentives and avoiding import tariffs.

Furthermore, as global efforts to combat climate change intensify, many countries are setting ambitious renewable energy targets. First Solar’s reputation as a technology leader and its experience in utility-scale projects could make it a preferred partner for large-scale solar deployments worldwide, driving significant growth in its international business.

According to recent market data, the Model Y outpaced competitors across the European Union, UK, and EFTA countries, solidifying Tesla’s dominance in the rapidly growing EV market. This milestone underscores the crossover’s enduring appeal, even amid criticism and political controversies surrounding the brand.

The European EV market has seen robust growth in 2025, with battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations surging by 28% in the first quarter alone, achieving a 17% market share. Despite a 49% drop in Model Y sales year-over-year, Tesla’s strategic pricing, extensive Supercharger network, and the vehicle’s versatility have kept it ahead of rivals like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Skoda Elroq. The Model Y’s spacious design, up to 600 km WLTP range, and optional seven-seat configuration continue to resonate with families and eco-conscious buyers.

However, Tesla’s journey hasn’t been without hurdles. The company faced a production slowdown due to the Model Y “Juniper” refresh, with the Gigafactory Berlin temporarily halting output to retool. This led to inventory shortages and a 30% sales decline for Tesla in March 2025. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk’s political activities have sparked backlash, with some analysts attributing part of the sales dip to brand perception issues. Yet, the Model Y’s performance suggests that practical factors—price, range, and infrastructure—outweigh external noise for many buyers.

Competitors are closing the gap, with Volkswagen leading EV brand sales in April and Chinese automaker BYD outselling Tesla in the same month. Still, Tesla’s ability to maintain the top spot amid fierce competition and a transitioning market highlights its resilience. As Europe pushes toward a 2035 zero-emission vehicle target, the Model Y’s success signals strong consumer demand for reliable, high-quality EVs.

He also said Reform would end a five-year funding plan to help developing countries cope with the impact of climate breakdown.
“I think they will delay, they will gradually wind down, they will push back the timing of targets and policies,” he said.
But Starmer silenced internal critics of his policies with a landmark speech declaring he would go “all out” on climate action and “not wait, but accelerate” on net zero.
As we have seen before, Reform has no solution to the energy challenges we face.","Labour will back down on its policies aimed at achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions, the deputy leader of the Reform has predicted.

Richard Tice, the energy spokesperson for Reform and MP for Boston and Skegness, told the Guardian his party would withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement that tries to limit global heating to 1.5C.

He also said Reform would end a five-year funding plan to help developing countries cope with the impact of climate breakdown.

“The idea that we can afford £10bn for climate aid is ridiculous,” he said. “We have plenty of problems ourselves that we rely on government to look after.”

Tice, who drives an electric car, said he believed Labour had “a growing anxiety that they have got it wrong on net zero. If energy bills do not come down, they will be in serious electoral trouble.”

He accused the government of trying to “bury” the costs of net zero in the latest spending review, and called the push for renewable energy “unaffordable” and “a colossal misjudgement”. He said: “That’s why we will see change, they will back down.”

Pointing to a Holyrood byelection last week, in which Labour won the seat with fewer than 1,500 votes more than Reform, he said: “That sends a very serious message to Labour that even where they used to be dominant in Scotland, there are very many people who will say Reform are the right party.”

But he did not expect Keir Starmer, the prime minister, to make a public U-turn on net zero. Rather, Labour would give way gradually, he predicted.

“I think they will delay, they will gradually wind down, they will push back the timing of targets and policies,” he said.

“They will be trying to find clever ways to walk back from their clean power targets [of decarbonising the electricity sector by 2030].”

Labour has come under pressure over its net zero plans from the Conservatives, sections of the media and from some unions. In April, former prime minister Tony Blair wrote that any strategy based on phasing out fossil fuels in the short term, or limiting consumption, was “doomed to fail”. There have also been unfriendly briefings from within government against Ed Miliband, the energy secretary.

But Starmer silenced internal critics of his policies with a landmark speech declaring he would go “all out” on climate action and “not wait, but accelerate” on net zero.

In this week’s spending review, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, lavished more than £60bn on green efforts, including £13.2bn for home insulation, about £30bn for nuclear power and £15bn for public transport outside London. Miliband was one of the big winners in the review, as the budget for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero ballooned by 16% a year, or 68% over the period of the review, to 2029.

A government source said Tice’s attacks on net zero would not sway Starmer. “This is nonsense from Tice. We are doubling down on this agenda because it is the way to take back control of our energy, protect households and create jobs,” said the source. “As the prime minister recently said, it is in the DNA of this government. We will fight Reform’s anti-jobs, anti-growth, anti-energy security, ideological agenda, community by community, as we make the patriotic case for clean energy and climate action.”

Reform’s vows to move away from renewable energy would mean job losses and raise costs by increasing reliance on expensive fossil fuels, some experts have said. The New Economics Foundation found that 60,000 jobs in wind and solar energy would be lost under the party’s policies and the costs to the economy would reach about £92bn by 2030.

Energy experts pointed out that renewable power was cheaper than overreliance on fossil fuels. Jess Ralston, analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “UK electricity is becoming more British and every bit of renewable power we get from solar reduces the amount of gas we need to import from abroad as the North Sea continues its inevitable decline. Campaigns against [renewables] leave the UK more vulnerable to geopolitical meddling of foreign actors like Putin.”

Reform has also pledged to reverse Labour’s ban on new drilling licences for oil and gas in the North Sea after Donald Trump, the US president, announced his backing for more North Sea fossil fuel production.

Ami McCarthy, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: “While it might be entertaining to watch Richard Tice’s Tiny Trump impression, Reform’s energy policy is completely deluded. As we have seen before, Reform has no solution to the energy challenges we face. More drilling for volatile fossil fuels serves no one except the oil and gas bosses that have been profiting exponentially at the expense of bill payers. And putting a windfall tax on wind will only make our bills go up, not down.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98767988100428b815124afe4e376fff0e46ab25/484_0_4840_3872/master/4840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=755ee515f4702303fd5dd7ca37edadf7,N,,2025-06-15 02:59:24.500078

Fusion reactions, in comparison, slam atoms together to form a new one, producing energy without lingering radioactive waste.
Abundant, cleaner fusion energy could provide a game-changing answer to fission's problems with the potential to lower utility bills.","Eight suppliers from six states have contributed to an astounding 60-foot-tall superconducting magnet crucial to a fusion experiment in France, according to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the agency overseeing the project.

U.S. ITER shipped the unit for the central solenoid early this year. It's made of more than 9,000 parts that were developed during a decade of work by numerous companies. It joined other high-tech components at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, commonly called ITER, in Europe. The machine reportedly cost more than $22 billion, per Euronews.

""Designing and manufacturing the first-of-a kind superconducting central solenoid is a major engineering challenge,"" Oak Ridge senior project engineer David Vandergriff said in a news release.

ITER is being built as part of a seven-nation partnership to prove that fusion reactions can be sustained at scale, harnessing the same energy source that powers the sun. The goal is to maintain a reaction for hundreds of seconds, per Oak Ridge.

Fission reactions already power 54 plants in the U.S. that produce about 19% of America's electricity, according to government data. But the atom-splitting process results in long-lasting nuclear waste. The byproduct is in the form of ceramic pellets, not green ooze, which is a common misconception. Rare, yet disastrous nuclear accidents are also a risk.

Fusion reactions, in comparison, slam atoms together to form a new one, producing energy without lingering radioactive waste. The hurdle has been creating a chamber that produces more power than it takes to make it, per the U.S. Department of Energy.

Both forms eliminate heat-trapping air pollution caused by the burning of dirty fossil fuels that increases the risk of severe weather, according to NASA. The extreme storms can cause blackouts, heat waves, and even higher insurance premiums.

But activists such as Jane Fonda have been outspoken against efforts to expand fission projects, including the reopening of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The site of an accident decades ago, it's now being tabbed by Microsoft to help power growing data center demand.

Colorado-based clean energy think tank RMI co-founder Amory Lovins told The Cool Down that nuclear power is increasingly expensive and slow to develop, touting solar and wind as better options.

Abundant, cleaner fusion energy could provide a game-changing answer to fission's problems with the potential to lower utility bills. And it will likely take a worldwide effort to unlock. Experiments are happening in China and elsewhere, as well. U.S. ITER's contribution is crucial to producing the magnetic flux needed to generate and maintain plasma current, according to Oak Ridge.

The setup must be able to withstand massive force, which is partly why the reactions that involve swirling plasma in an environment heated to hundreds of millions of degrees are so tough to accommodate. The team developed strong support components to bolster the unit during the operational rigors.

""At key times, the resultant vertical force on the module stack is up to 60 meganewtons — more than twice the force of a space rocket at blast off,"" U.S. ITER engineering technical director Kevin Freudenberg said in the release.

There are also ways other than fusion to tap sun-related energy. Solar panels capture radiation directly from the sun, converting it to electricity with improved efficiency.

I was motivated to better understand the way law, policy, science, and technology interact.","Emily Hammond discusses how U.S. energy and environmental policies may shift during the Trump Administration.

In a conversation with The Regulatory Review, Professor Emily Hammond provides their perspective on the Trump Administration’s efforts to control independent agencies and how those efforts may influence U.S. energy and environmental policies. Hammond also reflects on their background as an engineer conducting environmental remediation and how that work prepared them for a subsequent career as a lawyer and legal scholar.

The Trump Administration has claimed authority over independent agencies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This shift in how the President interacts with these agencies could profoundly impact U.S. energy policy. Hammond explains how a loss of agency independence could result in uncertainty, making it more difficult for climate-friendly energy companies to enter the market. They also express concern over the potential reversal of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) endangerment finding—that six greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare under the Clean Air Act—in the fight against climate change.

In a time when administrative agency power may be weakened, Hammond also reflects on their previous scholarship about the role of community protest in advocating for green policies. They conclude by offering advice to STEM students considering a legal career and how their background has benefited Hammond’s perspective as a legal scholar.

Hammond is the Glen Earl Weston Research Professor of Law at The George Washington University Law School. They are a nationally recognized energy, environmental, and administrative law scholar and serve as the faculty director of academic sustainability programs within the GW University Alliance for a Sustainable Future. President Biden previously appointed them to serve as the deputy general counsel for litigation, regulation, and enforcement at the U.S. Department of Energy. Hammond is a member of the Administrative Conference of the United States and an elected member of the American Law Institute.

The Regulatory Review is pleased to share the following interview with Emily Hammond.

The Regulatory Review: You recently commented on the Trump Administration’s push to assert control over independent agencies such as FERC. What are your concerns about this push?

Hammond: The Supreme Court has continued to cast further doubt on independent agency structure. But Congress created the classic independent agency for good reasons, among them shielding agency applications of technical expertise from political interference. This was accomplished with attributes like good-cause removal protection, multi-member structures, staggered terms, and representational requirements. FERC’s procedures are quite detailed and technical, and by congressional design, they involve multiple layers of decision-making. I am concerned about the ways naked political pressures could disrupt those procedures and lead to arbitrary outcomes.

TRR: Are there any implications for environmental or energy policy?

Hammond: Yes, we might expect to see deeply pronounced policy swings that are more akin to what executive agencies experience. It’s true that there is already some policy fluctuation, even at independent agencies. FERC, for example, is under considerable pressure to make it harder for renewable energy sources to compete in wholesale electricity markets. We saw some inroads there under the first Trump Administration. But were FERC to lose its independence, I would expect regulatory uncertainty to become even more pronounced, which is especially problematic for new, green market entrants that lack the entrenched inertia of traditional fossil-fueled market participants.

TRR: The Trump Administration has also sought to reduce the federal government’s role in fighting climate change. Are there any recent actions that you find particularly important to monitor?

Hammond: First and foremost, I am deeply concerned about the rule of law. Among many threats, there is the Trump Administration’s failure to comply with court orders and procedural due process protections; its attempts at coercion of institutions of higher education, law firms, and the American Bar Association; and its unadorned animus toward historically marginalized groups of people. Many of these actions were documented in a letter by the Association of American Law Schools. These actions undermine the system on which ordinary administrative law is premised, regardless of one’s policy preferences.

Of course, I am also monitoring efforts to reverse EPA’s endangerment finding from 2009, which stated that greenhouse gases threaten public health. These efforts may tee up a reconsideration of the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which allowed EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. I am also following the Department of Energy’s proposed rollbacks of a host of appliance efficiency standards, and am deeply concerned about the impacts of demolishing EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights and the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Justice and Equity.

TRR: Five years ago, you wrote an article calling for research into the role of community protest in energy policy and environmental law. Is that research still necessary?

Hammond: Protest movements, community vetoes, and other direct actions can reveal important disconnects between government policies and people’s lived experiences. Although administrative law offers regularized channels for people to engage on policy issues, such as those related to energy and the environment, it does not quite know what to do with direct action. The social sciences have more to say about this topic, and I am excited about legal research that stretches outside of doctrine and procedure to engage at the boundaries of law.

TRR: Considering the current Administration’s rollbacks in U.S. climate policy, do you anticipate the role of community involvement and protest in environmental and energy policy shifting over the next few years? If so, how?

Hammond: Communities are where new ways of ordering ourselves can be imagined and implemented. I expect to see significant creativity now and in the coming years. At the same time, I worry about unnecessary suffering that is traceable to these new federal policies, and I expect to see that reflected in direct action.

TRR: On a different note, you worked as an environmental engineer before law school. That is not a typical pre-law career. What work did you do as an engineer, and what drew you to law school?

Hammond: Among other things, I worked in environmental remediation before going to law school. Many of my clients were cleaning up hazardous waste in groundwater and soils under consent decrees with EPA. I became fascinated—and often frustrated—with how the legal system was setting the upper limits of my design choices. For example, we often had the technical capability to clean up contamination much more thoroughly than what the law required, and, of course, clients weren’t willing to pay for that extra. I was motivated to better understand the way law, policy, science, and technology interact.

TRR: How has your engineering background influenced your legal career and scholarship? Do you have any advice for engineering—or other STEM—students considering a legal career?",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Emily-Hammond-Banner-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 04:01:34.074351

Scientists at the University of Surrey have made a significant advance in eco-friendly battery technology, developing a system that not only stores more energy but may also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These lithium-CO₂ “breathing” batteries generate power while capturing carbon dioxide, offering a more sustainable option that could eventually outperform conventional lithium-ion batteries.

Previously, lithium-CO₂ batteries struggled with efficiency issues. They wore out quickly, were difficult to recharge, and depended on expensive, rare materials like platinum. Researchers at Surrey have addressed these problems by introducing a low-cost catalyst called caesium phosphomolybdate (CPM).

Through a combination of computer modelling and laboratory tests, they found that this simple change allowed the batteries to store much more energy, require significantly less power to charge, and operate reliably for more than 100 cycles.

Potential impact on emissions and space exploration

The study, published in Advanced Science, represents a promising step toward real-world use. If brought to market, these batteries could help reduce emissions from vehicles and industrial sources. Scientists also believe they could be used on Mars, where the atmosphere is composed of 95% carbon dioxide.

Dr. Siddharth Gadkari, Lecturer in Chemical Process Engineering at the University of Surrey, and corresponding author of the study, said:

“There’s a growing need for energy storage solutions that support our push toward renewable power while also tackling the growing threat of climate change. Our work on lithium–CO₂ batteries is a potential game-changer in making that vision a reality.

“One of the biggest challenges with these batteries is something called ‘overpotential’ – the extra energy needed to get the reaction going. You can think of it like cycling uphill before you can coast. What we’ve shown is that CPM flattens that hill, meaning the battery loses far less energy during each charge and discharge.”

Post-mortem testing reveals stable chemistry

To understand why the CPM worked so well, teams from Surrey’s School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and the Advanced Technology Institute used two approaches. First, they dismantled the battery after charging and discharging to study the chemical changes inside. These post-mortem tests found that lithium carbonate, the compound formed when the battery absorbs CO₂, could be reliably built up and removed – an essential feature for long-term use.

They then turned to computer modelling using density functional theory (DFT), which allows researchers to explore how the reactions unfold on the material surface. Results showed how the CPM’s stable, porous structure offered the ideal surface for key chemical reactions.

Dr. Daniel Commandeur, Future Fellow at the University of Surrey and corresponding author of the study, said:

“What’s exciting about this discovery is that it combines strong performance with simplicity. We’ve shown that it’s possible to build efficient lithium–CO₂ batteries using affordable, scalable materials – no rare metals required. Our findings also open the door to designing even better catalysts in the future.”

The discovery opens new doors for developing even better low-cost, easy-to-make battery materials. With further research into how these catalysts interact with electrodes and electrolytes, lithium–CO₂ batteries could become a practical, scalable way to store clean energy, while helping reduce carbon in the atmosphere.

On the one hand, it faces intensifying climate risks, mounting fuel import costs and increasing energy demand; on the other, it has the opportunity to shape a more sustainable and resilient energy future. The national budget for the 2025-26 financial year, recently unveiled, provides a timely lens through which to assess how seriously the country is preparing for a renewable energy transition. While there have been institutional efforts — notably the government’s move to update the Renewable Energy Policy 2008 to make it more relevant to the current context — the fiscal strategy laid out in this year’s budget does not reflect a proportionate commitment to the renewable energy agenda.

Current allocation

IN THE previous financial year (2024–25), the government had made a modest yet symbolically important allocation of Tk 100 crore (approximately $10 million) to establish a renewable energy fund. This was widely interpreted as a recognition that a transition to clean energy is not just desirable but necessary. Unfortunately, in the 2025–26 financial year budget, there is no mention of any continued or enhanced funding for this renewable energy fund, signalling a retreat rather than progress.

Instead, the broader energy and mineral resources division received a total allocation of Tk 2,178 crore — up from Tk 1,086 crore in the previous budget (which was later revised downward to Tk 1,053 crore). While the increased budgetary allocation may appear encouraging on the surface, it lacks any dedicated or earmarked fund for renewable energy development. In other words, there is no clear indication that any portion of this increased allocation is targeted towards achieving the country’s stated renewable energy goals.

This omission is glaring, particularly when viewed against the targets outlined in the Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan, which aims to generate 40 per cent of Bangladesh’s electricity from renewable sources by 2041. According to the plan, meeting this target would require a cumulative investment of approximately $37.4 billion to install 37.8GW of renewable energy capacity by 2050. The previous Tk 100 crore allocation, although symbolic, covered less than 0.03 per cent of the estimated investment requirement. The disappearance of even that symbolic commitment in the current fiscal year raises serious concerns about the country’s policy coherence and long-term strategy.

In the absence of sustained and scaled-up investments, policy reforms and clear budgetary commitment, the country risks falling behind its own renewable energy road map. Simply put, Bangladesh cannot afford to allow renewable energy to remain an afterthought in its national budgeting priorities — not when the stakes are this high.

More broadly, the energy sector budget continues to be skewed in favour of fossil fuels. A significant portion is still devoted to liquefied natural gas subsidies, diesel-based generation and capacity payments for idle fossil fuel plants. These priorities undermine the broader goal of transitioning to clean energy. At a time when global energy prices are volatile and the fiscal pressure from energy imports is growing, this approach risks deepening Bangladesh’s economic vulnerability.

Despite policy statements advocating for renewable expansion, the budget does little to shift the energy paradigm. There is no substantial provision for retiring outdated oil-based generation capacity. Neither is there a dedicated allocation to support the development of utility-scale solar or wind projects, or to build the necessary transmission infrastructure to integrate intermittent renewable sources into the national grid.

Barriers beyond budgets

BEYOND financial allocation, Bangladesh faces several structural and regulatory barriers to renewable energy development. While some incentives exist — such as tax holidays for solar equipment imports and duty reductions on key components — these have not been sufficient to spur large-scale private investment. Land acquisition remains a major obstacle, as does the lack of grid connectivity in remote or suitable locations for renewable projects.

Policy inconsistency further hampers progress. The Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 is outdated and lacks enforcement mechanisms. Tender processes are often delayed or cancelled, creating uncertainty for investors. Moreover, there is limited coordination between different government agencies, which slows down project approvals and implementation. Even when policies are in place, weak institutional capacity at both national and local levels constrains effective execution.

Bangladesh’s continued reliance on imported fossil fuels also acts as a structural impediment. In the 2023-24 financial year, the government spent billions on energy imports, which exacerbated the trade deficit and drained foreign exchange reserves. Instead of reallocating these funds to build domestic renewable capacity, the 2025–26 financial year budget continues this dependency, with more than Tk 7,000 crore proposed for subsidies on liquefied natural gas alone. This not only distorts market signals but also undercuts the competitiveness of renewables.

Green shoots

DESPITE these challenges, there are positive developments that suggest a shift, albeit gradual, is underway. The operation of a 60 MW wind power plant in Cox’s Bazar marks a significant milestone, being the country’s first major commercial wind project. Similarly, a 500 MW solar tender is currently in progress, aimed at integrating large-scale solar generation into the national grid.

Institutions like the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority and the Renewable Energy Research Centre in the University of Dhaka are contributing to the policy and research landscape. Their efforts in energy auditing, project feasibility assessments and capacity building are laying the groundwork for future growth. The newly announced Tk 100 crore renewable energy fund, while modest, indicates an institutional willingness to explore alternative financing mechanisms.

There are also encouraging signs in the private sector. Several local companies are investing in rooftop solar for industrial use, spurred by rising electricity tariffs and unreliable grid supply. Bangladesh has also seen a proliferation of solar irrigation systems in rural areas, supported by donor funding and government facilitation. These decentralised renewable energy solutions are critical for ensuring energy access in off-grid areas and reducing pressure on the national grid.

Recommendations

BANGLADESH must rethink its budgetary and policy approach to turn these green shoots into a robust forest of clean energy. Here are majore recommendations:

Scaled up targeted investment: The government should commit to allocating at least Tk 1,000 crore annually to renewable energy development. This funding should prioritise utility-scale solar and wind projects, battery storage, and smart grid technologies. Special attention should be given to scaling solar irrigation and mini-grid solutions for off-grid communities. Such targeted investments will yield both environmental and economic returns.

Financial market integration: Bangladesh must develop financial instruments to mobilise private capital. Green bonds, blended finance, and viability gap funding can reduce risks for investors. The central bank can play a role by issuing refinancing schemes for renewable projects. Local banks and non-bank financial institutions should be equipped with tools and incentives to lend to green energy ventures.

Fixing policy inconsistency: A new Renewable Energy Act is urgently needed to replace the outdated 2008 policy. This act should mandate clear targets, streamline approval processes, and ensure regulatory certainty. Transparent and timely tender processes must become the norm. Government agencies should coordinate better to ensure smooth implementation.

Redirecting fossil subsidies: The government should gradually phase out fossil fuel subsidies and reallocate these funds to clean energy development. A portion of the liquefied natural gass subsidy budget can be redirected to support renewable energy research and development, grid modernisation, and capacity building. This reallocation will not only reduce fiscal pressure but also level the playing field for renewables.

Advancing enabling infrastructure: A modern, flexible grid is essential for integrating renewable energy. Investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure must go hand-in-hand with renewable deployment. Net metering should be simplified and expanded. Technical standards for grid connection should be clearly defined to avoid project delays.

The 2025–26 budget marks a cautious step towards renewable energy development in Bangladesh. While the creation of a renewable energy fund is a move in the right direction, the overall allocation and strategic direction remain insufficient for a transformative shift. The continued emphasis on fossil fuel subsidies and lack of systemic support for renewables highlight the need for a more coherent and ambitious approach.

The transition to clean energy is not just an environmental imperative but an economic necessity. It is about reducing dependence on volatile global markets, creating green jobs, and ensuring energy security for future generations. Bangladesh has the technical capacity, entrepreneurial spirit, and policy frameworks to lead in South Asia’s green transition. What it needs now is the political will, financial commitment, and policy coherence to realise that potential.

The time for incremental change is over. The budget for the 2025–26 financial year should be seen as a foundation — but the real work lies ahead. Bangladesh must act boldly, invest wisely and lead decisively in building a resilient, inclusive and sustainable energy future.

I have not paid an electric bill for almost a decade. As a local science educator and homeowner, I have experienced firsthand how the federal home energy tax credits make home efficiency upgrades financially feasible for working families.

I upgraded the windows and insulation of my 1957 home using these incentives, and I installed rooftop solar. The results speak for themselves: My monthly electric bill dropped from $120 to zero. My home now produces twice the electricity I use, and I sell the surplus back to the grid.

However, ongoing uncertainty about the future of these tax credits has already forced me to delay upgrading to a heat pump. Eliminating credits — which the House has proposed to do — would push that decision further into the future, potentially risking the failure of my current system.

Every Tennessee family deserves the opportunity to eliminate their electricity bills through smart investments. Decades ago, the TVA was created to modernize our region's economy through federal partnerships. Today, these tax credits continue that legacy of supporting Tennessee jobs and energy affordability.

I urge Sens. Blackburn and Hagerty to defend these practical, market-based incentives that help families achieve energy independence. Please moderate the House's extreme proposal to axe these credits at the end of 2025.

SAVE Act makes it harder to vote

You may be among the millions of eligible voters who do not have the documentation required for voter registration under a bill making its way through the Congress. If enacted, the law, called the SAVE Act, would require every American citizen to appear in person and show specific documents, like a passport or an original birth certificate, when registering to vote or updating their voter registration. Any move would require an updated registration. This bill has already passed in the U.S. House and will soon be voted on in the Senate.

Those most vulnerable to being disenfranchised are:

› The hundreds of military service members who live in Tennessee and are frequently required to move.

› The hundreds of Tennesseans impacted by natural disasters who may have lost the documentation needed to register.

› The thousands of Tennesseans whose legal names no longer match the names on their birth certificates, like married women, adoptees and others who legally changed their names.

› The people who move within or into Tennessee. Last year, that was roughly 800,000 people.

This bill is designed to make it harder for all eligible U.S. citizens to vote. Please call your senators and tell them to vote ""no.""

'Too timid, stupid' to stop Trump spree

So what if the Democrats tried vainly and foolishly to keep Joe Biden in office? It didn't work out, they were exposed and they lost the White House in 2024. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but they reaped what they sowed.

Equally bad, if not worse, were the lengths to which MAGA and Trump went in 2020 when they falsely claimed the election was stolen. Don't forget the 1,500 convicted Jan. 6 losers, lowbrows and misfits who took time off from work and families to travel cross-country to storm the U.S. Capitol, assault the police and violently disrupt a routine electoral process.

Trump is a crime boss who's all about vengeance, retribution and getting even with adversaries. That's because he's a sociopath who's easily threatened by science, technology and facts. Can you imagine how MAGA would react if liberal Democrats were renaming the Gulf of Mexico and accepting $400 million airplanes from Arabs?

Trump is able to pull off all of this because we're all too timid and stupid. Plus, the Democrats care more about 11 transgenders somewhere than they do about reasonable public policy.

Judiciary is making our rights negligible

The authors of our Constitution established Congress, the people's voice, as the dominant arm of governance. The executive branch is limited to implementation of laws as written and as intended by Congress. The judiciary's narrow assignment: ensure legislative constitutional congruence. How far we strayed, with dire constitutional consequence, by allowing a disloyal cadre of federal judges — provincial, unelected, marginally qualified, political sycophants — to defiantly usurp unilateral authority to redefine and selectively adjudicate ""the rule of law"" — the fundamental foundation of any democracy.

Contrary to activist efforts to systematically usurp control, the authority to structure and dynamically manage ""the rule of law"" is exclusive to Congress and, with limited extension, the presidency. For Congress to capriciously surrender control and interpretive latitude solely to unelected, politically appointed judicial pawns renders Congress, the administration, and the constitutionally assured rights of American citizenry inconsequential. Not to be lost, by strategically blocking efforts to curb waste, fraud and abuse with frivolous injunctions, the activist cabal now effectively owns even the entrenched federal bureaucracy.

Throughout world history, the fall of democracies starts with judicial corruption. Such is America's current path. Past time to take back America.

#GlobalWindDay celebrations will highlight the opportunity and need to create thousands of good jobs in wind energy – with a special focus on the opportunity on offshore wind.

According to a joint Union-CSIRO report, offshore wind could support up to 8,000 jobs a year in Australia, providing a transition for workers currently employed in the offshore oil and gas industries, as well as onshore workers in fossil fuel industries. And the Global Wind Energy Council has found jobs in onshore wind will need to double this decade to reach Australia’s renewable energy targets.

Regional communities where major offshore wind projects are being proposed are ready for the shift to renewable energy and are keen to see meaningful action on transitioning workers and advancements in planning processes to ensure regions hosting wind power thrive into the future.

""Wind energy creates opportunities for our community, generating stable, rewarding jobs and strengthening our future while ensuring long-term energy security—it just makes sense” said Wendy Farmer, Yes2Renewables Gippsland Organiser and President of Voices of the Valley.

“Victoria is leading the way on offshore wind but one state can’t do this alone. Now that Albanese has been re-elected and the threat of nuclear off the table, our community would benefit from federal support for offshore wind” said Farmer.

In Gippsland, community members and workers came together for a community photo at the Toora wind farm, highlighting the region’s opportunity in onshore and offshore wind. There are several renewable energy proposals for the region representing over $40 billion in regional investment.

Adrian Cosgriff, former oil and gas worker says “Offshore wind is shaping up to be the cornerstone of Gippsland’s shift from coal to clean energy. It's a bold shift, but one that could redefine the Latrobe Valley’s identity from a coal power house to a renewable energy hub"".

In the Illawarra, local community group Good for the Gong will be holding a community meet up and celebration of wind energy at the Port Kembla Servo.

“This day gives us a great opportunity to think about the power of the wind and what it can do. The wind is a free and renewable resource that can power thousands of homes and businesses. It's a career path for young people, and an industry that can benefit all communities.” said Daryl Best, former Illawarra coal worker.

And on Friday 13th June, the Hunter Jobs Alliance launched a cross-sector push for offshore wind in the Hunter alongside 25 organisations and unions, calling on the federal government to kickstart the industry.

Members of unions and climate groups will also be sharing images and videos of individuals, families, and workers from around the country who want to see faster and more meaningful action on wind projects and jobs in the industry.

The weekend of action comes just over a week after Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio called on the federal Albanese government to support Victoria’s efforts to kickstart offshore wind.

Together, these coastal communities and workers are asking the Albanese Government to back the future of Australia’s regions with assurance of offshore wind jobs, and more action in supporting skills and training of current fossil fuel workers.

The CBO “score” of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act says there are $5.3 trillion in tax cuts, offset by $2.9 trillion in tax increases and spending reductions.

Passage of the bill resulted in a quickly escalating rupture of the political alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk. Musk called the bill a “disgusting abomination” and urged his followers on X to “KILL the BILL.” The president replied that Musk suffered from “Trump derangement syndrome.”

While it made for entertaining political theater, the Trump-Musk insults did nothing to enlighten anyone about content in the 1,116-page bill.

According to an analysis done by the respected Tax Foundation, a leading independent tax policy nonprofit, the bill makes some smart tax cuts and revenue increases. Most of the good tax policy aligns with the Tax Foundation’s principle of stability.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act extends many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). It permanently extends the rates and brackets of the 2017 individual tax cuts.

The bill also permanently extends the larger standard deduction (now $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly) and the alternative minimum tax threshold that were only temporary in the TCJA. Those two provisions have greatly simplified the tax code for millions of taxpayers.

Regarding the estate and gift tax, the bill institutes a permanent (and inflation-adjusted) exemption level of $15 million beginning in 2026, also enhancing stability.

The bill makes some good policies that raise revenue relative to current law by reducing some of the tax code’s many credits, deductions, and other preferences. The largest area of reform is the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) green energy tax credits; the bill raises about $500 billion over 10 years, cutting the cost of those credits in half.

Several IRA credits are also repealed – like those for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential energy products, which are expensive and ineffective.

The bill spends far too much on political gimmicks and carveouts for Trump’s pet tax cuts (on tips: cost $39.7 billion), overtime ($124 billion), a $4,000 additional special deduction for seniors ($65.5 billion), and car loan interest ($57.7 billion). All violate basic tax policy of treating taxpayers equally and do nothing to boost growth.

These four provisions combined cost $300 billion over the four years they are in effect, and if eventually extended, the cost would more than double over the next decade.

No tax on tips, overtime and car loans comes with conditions that will require hundreds of pages of IRS guidance to interpret.

Scrap one or all of these and the bill would add less to the deficit. The Senate should also reduce the $40,000 state-and-local tax deduction cap.

Republicans are taking heat for modest reforms to Medicaid that will spend 33% more next year than it did in 2019.

The bill would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion over the next decade, according to the CBO. The federal government admits it made $543 billion in inappropriate Medicaid payments from 2015 through 2024.

The bill mandates an 80-hour-per-month work requirement that would attach to benefits for able-bodied adults ages 19-64. Volunteer work and school would count toward the work requirement.

Medicaid covers about 800,000 Nevadans. It’s estimated the new work rules would cause about 13% of the state’s Medicaid population to drop coverage. The House GOP budget avoids the biggest fears concerning Medicaid cuts.

The legislation targets states that permit illegal aliens to enroll in Medicaid and verifies eligibility more frequently.

Failure to pass a budget reconciliation bill is not an option for Congressional Republicans. If this bill fails, taxes will rise $4.5 trillion next year.

The clean mobility wave sweeping across the world is being quietly shaped by something far less clean: hard geopolitics. In recent weeks, a subtle shift in the availability of rare-earth magnets has begun to ripple across India’s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. The magnets, essential to making EV motors run, are sourced predominantly from China. And China, many suspect, may be tightening the taps.

The timing has raised eyebrows. Just months after India denied Chinese giant BYD permission to set up an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the country, reports have emerged of sudden delays and complications in magnet supplies to Indian manufacturers. No formal ban, no official announcement, just the kind of slow squeeze that is hard to pin down but even harder to ignore.

So is this payback for BYD’s rejection? Or is it something more calculated, a strategic negotiation using the world’s EV ambitions as leverage?

Magnets: The Quiet Force Behind Every Electric Motor

To understand why this matters, it helps to know how crucial these magnets are. Rare-earth magnets, particularly neodymium-based ones, sit at the heart of most modern EV motors. Without them, performance drops, efficiency suffers, and manufacturers are forced to look for heavier or bulkier alternatives.

China currently produces around 90 percent of the global supply of these magnets. This gives it immense, and mostly invisible, control over the pace and cost of the global EV transition. And as some Indian automakers are now discovering, that control can be exercised subtly but effectively.

Negotiation by Discomfort

Insiders in the automotive and policy circles suggest that this may not be outright retaliation but rather negotiation through discomfort. The logic is simple. Deny Chinese carmakers access to a growing EV market like India, and the response won’t be a headline-grabbing embargo but a quiet tightening of the noose in places that hurt, like access to critical minerals.

It wouldn’t be the first time. When the United States clamped down on Chinese access to advanced chipmaking tech, China responded by restricting gallium and germanium exports. Once trade talks resumed and certain understandings were reached, those restrictions were lifted. The pattern seems consistent: pressure first, concessions later.

And India may now be caught in a similar loop, not necessarily because it matters deeply to China’s overall economic play, but because it’s a smaller fish that can be used to set an example.

Not Just BYD: Other Signs of Strategic Obstruction

This theory gains more weight when viewed alongside China’s approach to other foreign players. Take Foxconn, for instance. The Taiwanese firm has been a key Apple supplier and a vital part of India’s ambitions to become a major electronics manufacturing hub.

But its efforts to ramp up production in India have faced unexplained hurdles, including restrictions on Chinese engineers travelling to train Indian workers. China reportedly barred its own citizens from helping build the talent pipeline India needs.

It’s the same pressure through disruption playbook, and it appears to be designed not just to retaliate, but to slow down competing ecosystems before they take off.

India’s Strategic Blind Spot

What’s troubling is how little public conversation there has been around rare-earth magnet dependency. While the country has focused on battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and EV incentives, the quiet reliance on China for magnets has remained largely unaddressed.

If China is indeed using magnet supplies as a pressure valve, it reveals a major strategic gap. India needs to diversify sources, fast-track local magnet manufacturing, and invest in alternatives such as induction motors or magnet recycling technologies. This won’t be easy or cheap, but the cost of continuing dependence could be far higher.

A Future Negotiated Behind the Scenes

In this unfolding geopolitical drama, China may not even need to say anything out loud. The signal is already clear. Want steady magnet supplies? Rethink your position on Chinese automakers. Approve BYD, or at least reopen talks. Allow deeper trade access in return for smoother supply chains.

That might explain why the disruption hasn’t triggered a diplomatic standoff. It’s subtle, deniable, and utterly effective.

The bigger question now is whether India will bend or build. Will it negotiate, retaliate, or quietly absorb the discomfort? The answers may define not just the future of EVs here, but the nature of how small economies navigate their electric ambitions under the shadow of a global power that controls the magnets.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/062025/rare_earth_magnets_india_vs_china_featured_6871e4cc68.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 00:01:07.797134

""[The current U.S. administration] think that climate change isn't real, and they don't want anybody talking about it,"" Climate.gov's former program manager Rebecca Lindsey told NPR. Lindsay was one of the three workers who were dismissed in February.

Trump has actively hindered efforts to combat climate change for years, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and scrapping the Clean Power Plan during his first term as president in 2017. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) confirmed reports that it is working to abolish all restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants that use fossil fuels. The EPA further revealed that it intends to weaken regulations which limit power plants' emissions of toxic air pollutants such as mercury.

The NOAA is one of the many government agencies struggling under extensive staffing cuts implemented by Elon Musk's DOGE this year. Approximately 1,000 former NOAA workers have reportedly been axed since Trump took office, making up 10 percent of the NOAA's workforce. This includes over 150 critical roles which have been left empty as of May.

NPR reports that Climate.gov will cease publishing new content on July 1, though it remains unclear what will happen to the content currently available. The website could be completely shuttered, left to rot, or even reappropriated to host less scientific articles that are more in line with Trump's views on climate change.

""The automakers didn't know what to do, because they're really building cars for two countries,"" Trump said.
""This is the Trump administration's latest unlawful attempt to derail Washington's and the nation's transition to a clean future.""
Washington state officials have taken steps in recent days to prepare for the new federal law.
""Washington state does not have the infrastructure in place to properly institute such a sweeping mandate like this, and the technology has not advanced enough yet to support the trucking industry's rapid transition to clean energy.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed legislation into law that blocks Washington and other states from following California's lead in phasing out gas-powered vehicles.

Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Spokane was among dozens of Republican lawmakers invited to the White House for the occasion, which the president used to riff on a variety of topics in addition to the bill. Between calling Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ""a numbskull"" and highlighting his own popularity on TikTok, Trump celebrated the revocation of Biden-era waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency that let California impose stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government.

After the Biden administration allowed California to ban the sale of gas-powered cars starting in 2035, Washington followed suit in 2022, requiring that all new cars sold in the state be either fully electric or plug-in hybrids. A total of 17 states has adopted similar rules that the newly signed law revokes.

""The automakers didn't know what to do, because they're really building cars for two countries,"" Trump said. ""When you have 17 states, you're building cars for two countries.""

In an interview before the bill-signing ceremony, Baumgartner said the California regulation and its progeny would have been devastating to the U.S. economy.

""There does not exist the ability to magically create electric semi-trucks that move nearly 70% of the goods that Americans consume, so it would have been crippling to our economy if this rule was left in place,"" he said. ""You can't run semitrucks across America on unicorn laughter and aspirational dreams of environmental extremists.""

To revoke the waivers, the EPA issued under a previous administration, lawmakers invoked the Congressional Review Act, which allowed them to skirt the 60-vote supermajority required to pass most bills in the Senate. They did so despite the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber's neutral adviser on rules, both informing senators that the EPA waivers didn't count as the executive-branch rules for which the act applies.

Despite near-unanimous opposition from Democratic senators, the bill revoking California's waivers received significant bipartisan support in the House, plus a single Democratic senator, Michigan's Elissa Slotkin.

Trump was surprised on Thursday when a GOP lawmaker in the room told him 35 House Democrats had voted in favor. One of them was Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of southwest Washington, who runs an auto repair shop with her husband and has been a frequent critic of her party's push to speed a transition to electric vehicles.

Shortly after Thursday's ceremony concluded, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a joint lawsuit with nine other states challenging the elimination of California's waiver. The suit alleges that the resolution violates the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause and multiple federal statutes, including the Congressional Review Act and Administrative Procedure Act.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiff states allege that the Congressional Review Act has ""never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws.""

The lawsuit seeks to have the resolution declared unlawful and to require the federal government to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.

""Transportation is the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution in Washington, and our residents understand the transition to zero-emission vehicles is critical in the fight against climate change,"" Brown said in a statement Thursday. ""This is the Trump administration's latest unlawful attempt to derail Washington's and the nation's transition to a clean future.""

At the White House, Trump railed against Democrats' efforts to use state and federal laws to phase out gas-powered vehicles — the country's biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions — and speed the adoption of wind, solar and other low-carbon energy sources.

""They're making you buy stuff that doesn't work,"" the president said. ""You should be given the option to buy the electric car, by a gasoline-powered car, buy a hybrid. Probably not hydrogen, because hydrogen has the tendency that when it blows up, you're gonzo. It's over.""

After the room broke out in laughter at that line, Trump turned to Rep. Steve Scalise and said, ""It'll make your accident look like peanuts,"" apparently referring to the 2017 shooting that left the Louisiana Republican in critical condition.

Washington state officials have taken steps in recent days to prepare for the new federal law. In a June 6 memo, the Washington Department of Ecology notified vehicle manufacturers that it would temporarily pause compliance requirements for some vehicle categories.

""This recent federal action introduces new uncertainty for states, manufacturers, and consumers at a time when both businesses and consumers are making real progress in reducing the transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions,"" Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said in a statement June 6. ""It undermines states' rights, negatively impacts public health, and puts U.S. automakers at a competitive disadvantage in a global market that is rapidly transitioning to zero-emission vehicle technology.""

Sixkiller added that the agency would work with legislators, industry partners, local governments and other states to ""stay on track and ensure continued progress toward our climate and public health goals.""

After the federal bill cleared the Senate in late May, Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement that the action was ""brazenly out of step with the law, science, and public will.""

""For more than 50 years, states have possessed the ability to adopt stronger vehicle emissions standards to protect public health. Washington has exercised that right, along with 17 other states, resulting in cleaner air and healthier communities,"" Ferguson said. ""Despite this retreat from public health by the federal government, I'm committed to ensuring Washington moves forward on building a healthier, cleaner future.""

Thursday's bill signing drew praise of the Washington Trucking Association, which said it remains committed to working with Washington lawmakers and the Department of Ecology on a ""workable path to electrification.""

""California's EV trucking mandates have been a disaster for states like Washington, and have caused real harm to the trucking industry, a key link in our trade-dependent state's supply chain network,"" the association's president and CEO, Sheri Call, said in a statement. ""Washington state does not have the infrastructure in place to properly institute such a sweeping mandate like this, and the technology has not advanced enough yet to support the trucking industry's rapid transition to clean energy.

Vicki Giles Fabré, vice president of the Washington State Auto Dealers Association, said that Washington's franchised new car and truck dealers have ""made substantial investments in electrification and remain committed to selling electric and hybrid vehicles.""

""The Washington State Auto Dealers Association intends to work with state policymakers to find solutions that incentivize increased adoption of these vehicles, while also supporting the needs of franchised dealers, their employees, and the customers they serve,"" Fabré said in a statement Wednesday.

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed.
Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.
The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.
Why it matters Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale.","Understanding this carbon cycle is key to climate change research, according to Hamdi Zurqani, an assistant professor of geospatial science for the Arkansas Forest Resources Center and the College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. The center is headquartered at UAM and conducts research and extension activities through the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service, the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture's research and outreach arms.

""Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason,"" Zurqani said. ""They store roughly 80 percent of the world's terrestrial carbon and play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate.""

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed. Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.

In a study recently published in Ecological Informatics, Zurqani shows how information from open-access satellites can be integrated on Google Earth Engine with artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately map large-scale forest aboveground biomass, even in remote areas where accessibility is often an issue.

Zurqani's novel approach uses data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR, also known as GEDI LiDAR, which includes three lasers installed on the International Space Station. The system can precisely measure three-dimensional forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure and surface elevation. LiDAR stands for ""light detection and ranging"" and uses light pulses to measure distance and create 3D models.

Zurqani also used imagery data from the European Space Agency's collection of Earth observation Copernicus Sentinel satellites -- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Combining the 3D imagery from GEDI and the optical imagery from the Sentinels, Zurqani improved the accuracy of biomass estimations.

The study tested four machine learning algorithms to analyze the data: Gradient tree boosting, random forest, classification and regression trees, or CART, and support vector machine. Gradient tree boosting achieved the highest accuracy score and the lowest error rates. Random forest came in second, proving reliable but slightly less precise. CART provided reasonable estimates but tended to focus on a smaller subset. The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.

The most accurate predictions, Zurqani said, came from combining Sentinel-2 optical data, vegetation indices, topographic features, and canopy height with the GEDI LiDAR dataset serving as the reference input for both training and testing the machine learning models, showing that multi-source data integration is critical for reliable biomass mapping.

Why it matters

Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale. With more accurate assessments, governments and organizations can more precisely track carbon sequestration and emissions from deforestation to inform policy decisions.

The road ahead

While the study marks a leap forward in measuring aboveground forest biomass, Zurqani said the challenges remaining include the impact weather can have on satellite data. Some regions still lack high-resolution LiDAR coverage. He added that future research may explore deeper AI models, such as neural networks, to refine predictions further.

""One thing is clear,"" Zurqani said. ""As climate change intensifies, technology like this will be indispensable in safeguarding our forests and the planet.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/Planet-Earth-Forests.webp,N,,2025-06-15 00:02:50.404045

First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market.","First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), the largest US-based solar module manufacturer with a market capitalization of $18.8 billion, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of tariffs, technological advancements, and policy uncertainties. The company’s unique position as a domestic producer with proprietary technology has garnered significant attention from investors and analysts alike, particularly given its strong financial health. According to InvestingPro data, First Solar maintains robust liquidity with a current ratio of 1.93 and operates with minimal leverage, sporting a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.08.

Market Position and Competitive Advantages

First Solar has established itself as a leader in the US solar market, benefiting from its strong domestic manufacturing footprint and the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company specializes in cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar panels, which differ from the more common silicon-based panels produced by many of its competitors.

One of First Solar’s key competitive advantages lies in its proprietary technology, particularly its advancements in TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) technology. Analysts note that this gives the company a significant edge over other US cell manufacturers who are limited to using less efficient PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology. This technological moat has allowed First Solar to maintain stronger pricing power and potentially higher margins compared to its peers.

Tariff Impacts and Policy Uncertainties

The solar industry has been significantly impacted by recent trade policies, particularly the imposition of tariffs on imported solar modules. For First Solar, this presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, the company benefits from its domestic production capabilities, which shield it from the full impact of these tariffs. On the other hand, the broader market uncertainty created by these policies has led to some hesitation among customers and potential project delays.

In April 2025, the US Department of Commerce made final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on crystalline photovoltaic cells from several Southeast Asian countries. The resulting tariffs, with an all-in weighted average rate of approximately 330%, have created a complex competitive landscape. While these tariffs potentially benefit First Solar by increasing the costs for its foreign competitors, they also introduce uncertainty into the broader solar market.

First Solar’s management has indicated that the company’s contracts are structured to avoid directly absorbing tariff costs. However, the potential for reciprocal tariffs on its facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia poses a long-term challenge. Analysts estimate that First Solar would need to increase its average selling price (ASP) by approximately $0.02/watt to offset the tariff impact, which is significantly less than what its competitors would need to do.

Technology and Manufacturing Capabilities

First Solar continues to invest in its technological capabilities and manufacturing capacity. The company has begun limited commercial production of its CuRe ( Replacement) modules at its Ohio facility, with full deployment expected after testing. Additionally, First Solar is working on perovskites technology and a next-generation tandem device, which could further enhance its competitive position in the future.

The company plans to achieve 25 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity by 2026, with expansion plans in India, Alabama, Louisiana, and Ohio. This growth in capacity is expected to drive future revenue and potentially improve economies of scale.

However, First Solar has faced some challenges with its Series 7 modules, which have experienced manufacturing issues. While the company reports that these issues have been resolved for current production, there is a potential for warranty losses of up to $100 million related to previously produced modules.

Financial Outlook and Guidance

First Solar’s financial performance and guidance have been subject to significant scrutiny in recent months. In its latest earnings report, the company exceeded revenue expectations but missed gross margin targets due to various factors, including IRA credit sales, warranty charges, module shipment delays, and increased warehousing costs.

For fiscal year 2025, First Solar has revised its guidance downward, reflecting the uncertainties in the market. The company now expects revenue in the range of $4.5-5.5 billion, down from the previous guidance of $5.3-5.8 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) guidance has been reduced to $12.50-17.50 from the previous $17-20 range. Despite these adjustments, InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation with a P/E ratio of 14.94, which appears modest given the company’s growth trajectory and robust gross margin of 43.61%.

Despite these near-term challenges, analysts remain generally optimistic about First Solar’s long-term prospects. The company’s strong backlog, which extends through 2030, provides significant visibility into future revenues. Additionally, the potential for stable or increasing ASPs, even in the face of potential changes to tax credits and tariffs, supports a positive outlook for profitability.

Bear Case

How might changes to IRA provisions impact First Solar’s competitive advantage?

First Solar’s current competitive position is significantly bolstered by the incentives provided under the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly the 45X manufacturing tax credits. If these provisions were to be altered or eliminated under a future administration, it could substantially impact First Solar’s cost structure and profitability.

The company’s earnings are heavily tied to these credits, with some analysts estimating that they contribute significantly to the EPS forecast. A phase-out or removal of these credits could lead to a sharp decline in profitability, potentially eroding First Solar’s competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers who operate with lower cost structures.

Furthermore, any changes to the domestic content requirements for solar projects eligible for tax credits could reduce the demand for First Solar’s US-made panels, potentially leading to overcapacity and margin pressure.

What risks does First Solar face from potential supply chain disruptions?

First Solar’s reliance on specific materials, particularly tellurium for its CdTe panels, exposes the company to supply chain risks. Recent export controls imposed by China on tellurium have highlighted this vulnerability. While First Solar is taking steps to diversify its sourcing to countries like Peru and Canada, this transition could lead to increased costs and potential production disruptions in the near term.

Additionally, the company’s global manufacturing footprint, with facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia, exposes it to geopolitical risks and potential trade disputes. Any disruptions to production or increased costs due to tariffs or trade barriers could negatively impact First Solar’s ability to meet demand and maintain its competitive pricing.

Bull Case

How could First Solar’s technological edge in CdTe and TOPCon panels drive future growth?

First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market. These technologies offer higher efficiency and potentially lower production costs compared to traditional silicon-based panels.

As the solar industry continues to grow and demand for high-efficiency panels increases, First Solar’s technological edge could allow it to capture a larger market share and command premium pricing. The company’s ongoing research into perovskites and next-generation tandem devices could further extend this technological lead, potentially opening up new market segments and applications for its products.

Moreover, as environmental concerns become increasingly important to consumers and policymakers, First Solar’s CdTe technology, which has a lower carbon footprint and energy payback time compared to silicon-based panels, could become even more attractive in the market.

What opportunities does First Solar have to expand its market share domestically and internationally?

First Solar’s strong position in the US market, combined with its planned capacity expansions, positions the company well to capitalize on the growing demand for solar energy. The company’s domestic manufacturing capabilities align well with the increasing focus on ""Made in America"" products and energy security concerns.

Internationally, First Solar has opportunities to expand its presence in growing markets such as India and the Middle East. The company’s plans to establish manufacturing facilities in India could allow it to tap into one of the world’s fastest-growing solar markets while potentially benefiting from local incentives and avoiding import tariffs.

Furthermore, as global efforts to combat climate change intensify, many countries are setting ambitious renewable energy targets. First Solar’s reputation as a technology leader and its experience in utility-scale projects could make it a preferred partner for large-scale solar deployments worldwide, driving significant growth in its international business.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry.","JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Partnerships with countries experienced in electric vehicles (EV) development, particularly China, will be essential for the Indonesian EV industry, an Indonesian business leader told Xinhua.

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific. Even EVs from the same brand can use different types of batteries, each containing numerous components,"" Kumara said.

As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is currently attracting numerous international EV automakers and nickel miners.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citron, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer.

Garman highlighted the company’s commitment to helping Australian organizations leverage generative AI. He said the investment will strengthen data infrastructure, increase renewable energy use, and support Australia’s ambition to become a global AI leader.

Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres welcomed the investment in an interview with Sky News Australia, calling it a “very significant” step for the nation’s digital infrastructure.

“It’s in Australia’s interests to lean into the opportunity,” Ayres said. “We must be makers of the technology as well as takers.”

Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia

As part of the expansion, Amazon will also build three new solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to power the growing infrastructure and support its clean energy goals. Amazon will commit to buying a combined capacity of more than 170 megawatts across these farms.

Amazon operates eight solar and wind energy projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, which help power its Australian data centers and fulfillment facilities. Once all 11 of its planned renewable energy projects are online, they are expected to produce over 1.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy annually—enough to power approximately 290,000 Australian homes each year.

Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon invested an estimated A$467 million in renewable energy projects in Australia. In 2024, Amazon was Australia’s third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and remains the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally.

As per a study by Accenture, Australian organizations migrating compute-heavy AI workloads to AWS can reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% compared with on-premises data centers. This is because of AWS’s infrastructure hardware, power, cooling, and carbon-free energy procurement efficiencies.

AWS powers Australia’s AI ambitions with expanding cloud footprint

The investment aligns with the Australian government’s goal to boost productivity and economic growth through AI-driven innovation.

It will equip hundreds of thousands of Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and partners with advanced cloud and AI tools, enabling large-scale innovation while ensuring compliance with local data residency and regulatory standards. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources estimates that AI and automation could add up to A$600 billion to Australia’s GDP annually by 2030.

AWS’s presence in Australia began in 2012 with the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. This was followed by the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific in 2023, including the country’s first AWS Local Zones in Perth.

In April 2024, AWS established Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed generative AI service, in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Moreover, in July 2024, the Australian Government linked with AWS to provide a “Top Secret” AWS Cloud to deliver cloud innovation in national security and defense and enhance the nation’s defense and intelligence capabilities.

For this reason, ""It's interesting because China is known for its strong EV component industry.","JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Partnerships with countries experienced in electric vehicles (EV) development, particularly China, will be essential for the Indonesian EV industry, an Indonesian business leader told Xinhua.

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific. Even EVs from the same brand can use different types of batteries, each containing numerous components,"" Kumara said.

As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is currently attracting numerous international EV automakers and nickel miners.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citroën, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer. For this reason, ""It's interesting because China is known for its strong EV component industry. We encourage our local companies to learn from Chinese firms.""

At United Way of Santa Cruz County, we envision a community where every person, regardless of income, race or ZIP code, has the opportunity to thrive. Every child deserves access to nutritious meals, every senior deserves quality health care and every family should have the support they need to be financially secure. Since 1941, United Way has united community members, nonprofits, businesses and government agencies to improve lives through education, health and financial stability.

But that future is now at risk.

Congress is currently considering H.R. 1, the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which proposes deep cuts to foundational programs like Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), CalFresh (SNAP) and the Child and Earned Income Tax Credits. These programs are not excesses or luxuries. They are lifelines for many in Santa Cruz County.

This is not a partisan issue. It is a community issue.

The proposed cuts would have devastating impacts across the Central Coast. Consider the following:

In Santa Cruz County alone, more than 42,000 people — including children, low-wage workers and older adults — rely on CalFresh to afford groceries.

Nearly 80,000 working families across Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties benefit from the Child and Earned Income Tax Credits, which help pay for child care, rent, school supplies and transportation.

Over 100,000 Santa Cruz County residents — almost one in three — depend on Medi-Cal for critical health care services, including preventive care, prescriptions and mental health support.

These are not handouts. They are investments in people. CalFresh helps kids focus in school instead of on hunger. Medi-Cal helps workers stay healthy enough to keep their jobs. Tax credits allow parents to stay employed while managing rising costs.

At United Way, we see the real impact of these programs every day. Our 211 Santa Cruz County helpline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to connect people with food, housing, mental health support and medical care. If you or someone you know needs help, call 211 to be connected with trusted local resources.

When families call in crisis, they are not looking for charity. They are trying to hold things together. If H.R. 1 becomes law, we anticipate a sharp increase in these calls — but our local safety nets are already stretched thin.

This is more than a policy debate. It is a test of who we are as a community. Do we believe that working families, children and seniors deserve stability? Do we respond to hardship with compassion or indifference?

As I often remind our partners, “United Way is not here to serve just one part of the community. We are here to lift the whole community. When we protect the most vulnerable, we strengthen the foundation for everyone.”

I urge every reader to contact their congressional representatives today. Tell them:

“I am deeply concerned about the impact of H.R. 1 on my community. These cuts are too deep, too fast and too harmful. We need policies that support, not punish, our working families, children and seniors.”

Find your representative at congress.gov/members/find-your-member.

At United Way of Santa Cruz County, we remain committed to connecting families with resources, empowering youth through United4Youth and building a more resilient safety net through United4Community. But we cannot do it alone.

Your voice matters. Together, we can ensure that compassion, not cuts, guides our path forward.

President Donald Trump's administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports.

The US Environmental Protection Agency proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the US fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do. Small refiners can apply for an exemption to the requirements if they can prove the obligations would cause undue harm.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 — a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027.

The Class VI program is the lynchpin to scaling geologic storage of captured CO2 to meet the anticipated storage demand from the growing carbon management industry.
“Today, 60 projects have submitted 175 Class VI well applications to the EPA for review, and the queue continues to grow.
“The Coalition urges EPA to continue timely and comprehensive reviews of state primacy applications and individual well applications.","The following statement may be attributed to Christian Flinn, public policy manager at the Carbon Capture Coalition (the Coalition), a non-partisan collaboration of companies, labor unions, and NGOs building support for carbon management policies. It is on the recent announcement that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed granting primary enforcement authority over Class VI wells to the state of Texas:

“The Carbon Capture Coalition welcomes the recent announcement from the EPA that they have proposed granting primary enforcement authority (primacy) over Class VI wells to Texas, after a public comment and hearing process this summer. Texas would join Wyoming, North Dakota, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Arizona as the sixth state in the nation to be granted authority over Class VI wells. Granting primacy empowers states to manage and regulate Class VI injection wells within their jurisdiction, which importantly must meet or exceed the EPA’s requirements to qualify for Class VI primacy.

“The EPA oversees the Class VI program to ensure that geologic carbon storage is carried out in a manner that protects human health and underground sources of drinking water, while permanently storing carbon dioxide captured from industry and power facilities, as well as directly from the atmosphere. The Class VI program is the lynchpin to scaling geologic storage of captured CO2 to meet the anticipated storage demand from the growing carbon management industry.

“Today, 60 projects have submitted 175 Class VI well applications to the EPA for review, and the queue continues to grow. Meanwhile, states with primacy are currently reviewing more than 30 Class VI well applications. By expanding the number of states granted primacy over Class VI wells, EPA can reduce its backlog of applications and dramatically accelerate the necessary build-out of carbon management projects throughout the country.

“The Coalition urges EPA to continue timely and comprehensive reviews of state primacy applications and individual well applications. We look forward to working with the administration and bipartisan members of Congress to ensure the Class VI program has the necessary resources, technology, and training to efficiently complete a growing number of primacy and individual well reviews in the critical months and years ahead.”

Calvin Trostle, Ph.D.,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service agronomist and statewide hemp and alternative crop specialist, Lubbock, said markets may be limited for alternative crops like sunflowers, sesame, Sudan grass and canola, but Texas producers are taking advantage of cropping opportunities.
For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income.
“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said.
“It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets.","Texas farmers continue to find ways to add value to their operations through alternative crops like oilseeds and cover crop forages.

Calvin Trostle, Ph.D.,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service agronomist and statewide hemp and alternative crop specialist, Lubbock, said markets may be limited for alternative crops like sunflowers, sesame, Sudan grass and canola, but Texas producers are taking advantage of cropping opportunities.

For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income. They can also provide the benefits of a cover crop during the cool season.

“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said. “But for producers looking for opportunities to supplement their primary crop production, they can really be a value-added component.”

Sunflowers show potential

Trostle said total acres for sunflowers in the Rio Grande Valley increased slightly but remained static in other regions of the state. Growers typically engage with buyers before acres are planted to fill contracts at set prices. Seeds are grown for two markets – as bird food and for oil extraction.

Per pound prices were good for both markets, he said. Seeds bound for “crushing” end up in oil form for various products, but primarily for cooking, especially in large-scale food manufacturing.

Sunflower seeds’ high-oleic content makes them more shelf-stable and better for cooking and frying, but their monounsaturated fats retain healthy attributes, he said.

Trostle said there may be growth potential in the demand for crushing-seeds for oil but the demand for them as bird food remained steady.

“Sunflowers seem to provide some price security and safety for growers, and it has the potential for premiums based on oil content,” he said. “It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets. That’s why we recommend growers dedicate some acres each season to experiment with growing options that might have potential for their operation.”

Finding markets for alternative crops

Production capacity in other alternative crops slipped or made gains based on regional demands, Trostle said.

Sesame seed acres remained close to last year, but demand dropped when a contractor pulled out of the Texas market, he said. As a result, prices have not been strong enough to generate interest in expansion among producers. It remains an alternative crop that is on a contract basis and filled by established growers.

Canola for oil production also experienced a decline in demand, even in surrounding states like Oklahoma, as acres moved to other states, Trostle said. However, some growers are finding a market for the cool-season crop as a high-value forage for dairy production in the Panhandle. Canola is a brassica, which are fast-growing, high yielding forage and cover crops, and its silage’s high nutritive value outperforms grasses like wheat and ryegrass.

Trostle said wheat, triticale and Sudan grass, which is a forage sorghum variety, have generated increased interest among producers. They are seeing the harvest and post-harvest value in these cool-season crops.

They can be grazed or grown as forage but also provide excellent cover-crop residue for growers who might follow with cotton or other warm-season commodities.

Trostle saidTexas A&M AgriLife Research and AgriLife Extension scientists continue to research the versatility of these cool-season options and provide valuable information and recommendations to growers.

“A new major educational effort for me this year is the advent of prussic acid-free sorghums,” he said. “There are first-time sorghum/Sudan hybrids that eliminate prussic acid poisoning in stressed or frostbitten sorghums.”

Trostle said that for now, those seeds cost more, and there are first-year limited seed supplies.",http://www.ntxe-news.com/images/icons/fb_logo.gif,N,,2025-06-15 00:02:46.568822

U.S. and Chinese trade officials concluded trade talks earlier this week to address Beijing’s control over critical minerals and rare earths. The export restrictions have prompted major automakers to consider relocating auto parts manufacturing to China.

To counter China, the Trump administration is using the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, also known as FAST-41, to boost the domestic production of critical minerals. This federal program, which began during former President Barack Obama’s second term, helps streamline the permitting process for critical infrastructure projects.

The Permitting Council oversees the program, which covers about 19 economic sectors, including transportation, semiconductors, and renewable energy. The program was not expanded to include mining until the Biden administration. Now, the program includes six mining projects, five of which were added this year.

Mining is of particular concern because critical minerals are needed to build electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, grid storage, and nuclear power. In other words, they are key to advancing the energy sector, which faces an enormous ramp-up in demand in the coming years from manufacturing and artificial intelligence.

For instance, the critical mineral graphite is an input for lithium-ion batteries in EVs, electronics, and energy storage systems. Minerals are also required for aircraft, helicopters, and missile components in the defense sector.

Graphite One is one of six mining companies approved for the FAST-41 program. Graphite One plans to build a complete supply chain of graphite in Alaska, from upstream mining to midstream processing and the production of lithium-ion battery anode materials and other graphite products for the U.S. market.

The FAST-41 program, which established the 16-member Permitting Council, helps to guide infrastructure projects such as mining through the permitting process by collaborating with various federal agencies and establishing strict deadlines.

Dan McGroarty, a Graphite One advisory board member, told the Washington Examiner that FAST-41 is about “transparency” and “predictability.”

“Uncertainty is really the enemy of investment,” McGroarty said, adding that the program “maps the permitting steps.”

The success of a company like Graphite One would be a major step toward domestic self-reliance. The U.S. does not have a complete and self-sufficient supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths.

“It’s a big deal to try to recreate the entire supply chain,” McGroarty said.

The FAST-41 program is thought to be crucial for accelerating projects like Graphite One. It often takes years for a mine to start operating due to legal challenges and bureaucratic hurdles, including the need to secure federal permits and undergo environmental reviews from various agencies.

Emily Domenech, the newly appointed head of the council, said it could take 29 years to start a mine operating in the U.S. Domenech described the Permitting Council as a “sherpa” for businesses seeking to initiate projects.

“My goal would be to move as many projects to construction in the first two years of the Trump administration as is humanly possible,” Domenech told the Washington Examiner earlier this month.

NEW TRUMP PERMITTING COUNCIL HEAD HOPES TO MAKE AGENCY UNNECESSARY

The FAST-41 program has two functions: covered projects and transparency projects.

Covered projects will receive the complete services of the FAST-41 program to simplify their permitting process. Transparency projects do not benefit from the full range of services the program offers. Yet, they are still included in the program’s dashboard, allowing the public and private sectors to monitor their progress.

Domenech said the transparency function includes 25 critical minerals projects.

“It’s not sort of the full-service sherpa that you get out of the FAST-41 process, but it’s a great way to, frankly, leverage all of the incredible expertise we have at the permitting council to ensure that we can move this stuff forward without wasting any time,” Domenech said.

She expects the council to add more projects to the transparency function and noted that fast-tracking critical projects has bipartisan support, specifically when it comes to competing with U.S. adversaries like China.

Democrats “recognize that the federal government has become a hurdle to building in the United States and that there’s no way that we will ever compete with China if the government is stopping people from building,” she said.

“We talk about it all the time — how quickly China can ramp up their industries,” Domenech said.

There is bipartisan recognition that “we need to use all the tools we can” to accelerate permitting to compete with the unilateral power the Chinese government has to launch projects.

U.S. Critical Materials is an exploration and development company seeking to join the FAST-41 program for its rare earth mining project in Montana. The company seeks to extract and process rare earth elements.

Harvey Kaye, the Director of U.S. Critical Materials, said that mining domestic critical minerals is crucial for U.S. national security, particularly because of its reliance on China.

TRUMP SAYS CHINA TRADE DEAL IS ‘DONE’ WITH TARIFFS SET AT 55%

“We want to stand on the steps of the White House, and we would say, ‘Mr. President, it’s here in America. It’s processed in America, and you do not have to bend the knee to China,’” Kaye said.

Kaye said it will take several years to compete with China, adding that “we cannot be in the position where we are today.”",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25162392969180-scaled.webp,N,,2025-06-15 04:58:57.299686

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W) (""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated April 11, 2025-wherein the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies"") submitted provisional patent applications (the ""Patent Applications"") with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"") for its next-generation battery rebalancing hardware and software platform-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has now successfully validated the core innovations described in the filings through multiple real-world preliminary trials (the ""Preliminary Trials"").

In a Preliminary Trial disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies tested its second-generation, patent-pending rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") on a 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack (the ""Nissan Battery Pack""), representative of the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States. The Nissan Battery Pack exhibited minor voltage imbalances typical of real-world use. Prototype 2.0 successfully rebalanced all 96 cells to 4.20 volts - the commonly recognized full charge state in the industry1 - achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity and restoring 1.95 ampere-hours, representing a 3.9% increase in usable capacity. The trial demonstrated the precision of Prototype 2.0 in restoring performance even on a relatively well-balanced battery pack, and supported its scalability across high-volume electric vehicle (EV) battery platforms.

In a subsequent Preliminary Trial, as disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025, Prototype 2.0 was tested on a significantly imbalanced 144-cell battery pack from a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""). The Preliminary Trial was conducted on a battery pack exhibiting significant real-world imbalance and resulted in the recovery of 66.3 ampere-hours, representing a 37.7% recovery of the Rated Capacity, and 100% recovery of imbalance-induced capacity loss. The Electric Truck Preliminary Trial demonstrated the robustness of the technology under more demanding conditions and expanded Prototype 2.0's proven applicability to commercial vehicle platforms.

""The trials are confirming exactly what we filed with the USPTO,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""To see both passenger and commercial electric vehicle battery platforms respond with full imbalance-related capacity recovery proves our technological innovations work-and it works where it matters most: in real-world environments with real-world degradation caused by battery cell imbalance.""

Prototype 2.0

Together, these initiatives underscore Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' commitment to demonstrating the adaptability, precision, and commercial readiness of its rebalancing platform across a wide range of EV battery platforms. By validating performance on both passenger and commercial electric vehicles - with varying chemistries, architectures, and states of degradation - Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is building the foundation for broad-based adoption. These efforts reinforce its mission to deliver a scalable, software- and hardware-enabled solution capable of correcting imbalance-related degradation that affects millions of lithium-ion battery packs worldwide.

Importantly, the Preliminary Trial results not only validate the technical functionality of Prototype 2.0, but also demonstrate its ability to recover substantial usable capacity otherwise lost to cell-level imbalance. This has clear implications for extending driving range, improving battery health, and reducing lifecycle costs for electric vehicle owners. The significance is amplified in the case of the Electric Truck, where nearly 40% of the pack's Rated Capacity was recovered, reinforcing Prototype 2.0's relevance in fleet and commercial contexts where battery degradation can severely impact performance, uptime, and asset value. The results support a broader opportunity to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in battery lifespan extension and reconditioning, targeting the rapidly growing segment of electric vehicles anticipated to fall outside of their manufacturer's warranty, which is estimated to be nearly 40 million vehicles worldwide by 20312,3.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to continue its validation phase, which includes additional testing on a range of electric vehicle battery platforms and high-volume vehicle models. These efforts are designed to support the Company's progression from provisional to full utility patent applications, while also verifying system compatibility across multiple lithium-ion chemistries and configurations. This ongoing validation will play a critical role in expanding market readiness and demonstrating the commercial potential of Prototype 2.0 across both private and fleet-based EV markets.

The Patent Applications represent the culmination of multiple years of development, validation, and innovation by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies and mark a significant milestone toward solidifying its position in the lithium-ion and EV battery rebalancing and lifespan extension market. The company's next-generation rebalancing technology - validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), as further described below-reinforces its commitment to delivering real-world solutions that support battery longevity and sustainability.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20234. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units5, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage6,7. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements8. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the NRC, focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced - one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC - resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

What is Battery Rebalancing?

Patent Applications

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' first patent application, method and system for battery pack adjustment, introduces a novel solution to address the common issue of imbalanced battery cells within a battery pack - an issue that leads to reduced capacity, safety concerns, and shortened lifespan. In most battery packs, cells charge and discharge at different rates due to variations in manufacturing, internal resistance, and temperature, which causes some cells to reach full charge or depletion before others. As a result, traditional battery management systems (BMS) cut off charging or discharging based on the weakest cell, wasting the remaining potential of other cells. This invention solves that problem through a smart system that continuously monitors and adjusts the state of charge (SOC) of each group of cells (referred to as ""strings""). The system includes a display controller (which manages operations), a charger and discharger (handling overall energy flow), and an equalizer (which precisely adjusts each string). By allocating charge and discharge intelligently across the cells, the system ensures they all reach full capacity and deplete evenly, thereby maximizing usable energy, detecting early signs of degradation, enhancing safety, and extending the overall life of the battery pack.

The second patent application, for two-wire charging and remote voltage detection, presents a streamlined method to charge a battery and measure its voltage using only two wires-significantly reducing system complexity and hardware costs. In conventional battery systems, separate wires or sensors are typically required to monitor voltage during charging, which adds material costs and design challenges, especially in large-scale applications like electric vehicles or grid storage. This invention enables both functions over the same wire pair by briefly pausing the charge current, opening a switch, and using that moment to measure the battery's voltage through the same lines. A pulse isolation drive circuit is used to manage this operation safely and reliably, even when voltage levels are floating or unstable. The result is a simplified yet highly accurate system that maintains the integrity of voltage readings while eliminating the need for redundant hardware. This two-wire approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern battery systems that demand reliability, safety, and scalability.

Funding: Quaise Energy","Quaise Energy is pioneering millimeter-wave drilling to access deep geothermal heat and provide clean, scalable energy globally.

Quaise Energy has taken a major step forward by demonstrating its new drilling technology on a full-scale oil rig just outside Houston. The company, founded only seven years ago, is now working to show that clean, renewable geothermal energy has the potential to power the world, according to CEO and co-founder Carlos Araque.

“Geothermal energy is available everywhere on massive scales,” said Araque. “If you take all fossil, all nuclear, and all other forms of renewable energy combined, they’re not even a millionth of a millionth of the thermal stores of energy below the Earth’s surface.” “It’s mind-boggling, and to get it, we only have to go down two to twelve miles. That’s how close we are to infinite clean energy no matter where you are in the world.”

Araque spoke on May 21 during the first public demonstration of the company’s drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig owned by Nabors, one of the largest oil and gas drilling companies in the world. About 50 people attended the event, including reporters, potential investors, and prospective Quaise customers. Among them were William Restrepo, CFO of Nabors and a member of Quaise’s board, and Lauren Boyd, director of the Geothermal Technologies Office at the U.S. Department of Energy.

Superhot, Superdeep

Geothermal energy—the heat beneath our feet—has existed for a long time, but it contributes very little to today’s overall energy supply. “That’s because the true geothermal resource, the one that matters, is not very accessible. Getting to it is beyond the economic reach of the conventional tool set of oil and gas,” said Araque.

The largest source of geothermal energy lies about two to 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface, where the rock is so hot that if water could be pumped there, it would become supercritical—a steam-like phase unfamiliar to most people. (More familiar phases include liquid water, ice, and vapor.) Supercritical water can carry five to ten times more energy than regular hot water, making it an extremely efficient energy source if it could be brought to the surface and used to power turbines that generate electricity.

Currently, these deep resources are out of reach, except in rare places like Iceland where they lie closer to the surface. The main barrier is drilling. Conventional oil and gas drills cannot withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures found miles underground without costs rising dramatically with depth.

Quaise is developing an alternative approach that replaces mechanical drill bits with millimeter-wave energy, which is similar to the microwaves used in kitchens. These waves melt and then vaporize rock, allowing for the creation of increasingly deep boreholes.

Steady Progress

The May demonstration at the Nabors facility marks the latest step in what Araque describes as an aggressive timeline to validate Quaise’s drilling technology. His long-term vision is to create a renewable energy source that can compete directly with oil and gas. “This is not a company built to develop a cool drilling gadget. We aim to become a geothermal developer. Our product is not a drill bit. Our product is clean heat and energy that is abundant, reliable, and affordable on a global scale,” Araque said.

The core concept behind Quaise’s drilling method was developed at MIT over some 15 years. Researchers there proved that millimeter waves could drill through basalt, a rock type that, along with granite, makes up most of the deep subsurface. The gyrotron device that generates these millimeter waves isn’t new—it has been used for about 70 years in nuclear fusion research.

Building on that foundation, Quaise has been refining the technology to reach greater depths. At MIT, the original holes were only two inches wide and two inches deep. Earlier this year, engineers at Quaise’s Houston facility drilled a hole four inches wide and 10 feet deep.

Andres Calabressi, Head of Manufacturing at Quaise, emceed the Quaise demonstration with a microphone to communicate over the steady rumble of powerful equipment. He explained that beginning in March, the company lowered columns of granite about nine inches in diameter into a conventionally drilled hole under the rig. Together, those columns made a core some 80 feet long that sits inside a metal casing. The latter is outfitted with ports to monitor parameters like heat and pressure, data that allow the team to test recipes for optimal drilling.

The Quaise engineers then integrated the millimeter-wave technology with the rig. In the May 21 demo, they shot millimeter waves into the granite column, deepening a hole four inches in diameter that they’d already drilled to ten feet. (The next week, the team successfully drilled to 30 feet for the first time; the next goal on this phase of the work is 40 feet.)

During the demonstration, Calabressi was flanked by three large flat screens showing different dimensions of the work. One tracked key parameters like rock temperature, while another showed a video close-up of the millimeter waves melting rock. (The latter was taken previously in the Quaise lab since those interactions were not visible at the Nabors rig.)

Araque noted that the demo was “full scale in size, but not in power.” The gyrotron involved produced 100 kilowatts of power. “That’s a tenth of the power that will be commercially relevant, and is roughly equivalent to the power of the car you drove to this demonstration.”

Next month, Quaise expects the delivery of a much larger gyrotron capable of producing one megawatt of power. “That is commercially relevant. We aim to get it to the field over the next two years,” Araque said.

In the meantime, the company is preparing for another demonstration planned for July in Marble Falls, Texas. There, the team aims to drill multiple holes 130 meters (about 425 feet) deep into an actual granite outcrop for the first time. Henry Phan is Vice President of Engineering at Quaise. He explained that the Marble Falls rig will be smaller, “allowing us to be more nimble in terms of moving from one hole to another.”

Additional Advances

Quaise has also been tackling other scientific and engineering challenges associated with harvesting the energy from superhot, superdeep rock. Trenton Cladouhos, vice president of geothermal resource development at Quaise, described several of those challenges and advances toward solving them in a talk the day before the Quaise demo at the Geothermal Transition Summit North America in Houston.

Cladouhos said that Quaise is working with vendors and universities “to push them to consider higher and higher temperatures.” For example, last year a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne reported new insights into what happens when superhot, superdeep rock is exposed to water that can eventually transfer the rocks’ heat to the surface. The work, supported in part by Quaise, was published in the journal Nature Communications. It confirmed earlier modeling work also supported by Quaise.

In addition, Cladouhos noted that Quaise has an in-house engineer who has been working on the design of superhot geothermal power plants. Earlier this year, Senior Mechanical Engineer Daniel Dichter reported insights to that end in two papers.

Toward the Future

Araque concluded his presentation at the demo by describing the company’s blueprint for developing a superhot, superdeep geothermal resource available around the globe. It involves dividing the world into three tiers based on geothermal gradient, or how close the resource is to the surface. Tier 1, for example, will focus on relatively accessible superhot rock. This means that the first Quaise power plant will probably be located in the American West, perhaps near the Newberry Volcano site in Oregon. Newberry has a long history of geothermal exploration.

Although still a ways off, Tier III sites, which will involve drilling as much as 12 miles down, “hold the key to making superhot geothermal a truly global energy source. Tier III sites could provide power to more than 90% of humanity.”

Superhot Team

Araque described Quaise’s goal of unlocking superhot, superdeep energy for the world as “a moonshot. But it is not a moonshot.” The people working to “pioneer this transformative approach to clean energy have transitioned from careers in oil, gas, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion,” and all have histories of achievement.

For example, several were involved in the invention and development of Manara, a production and reservoir management solution developed at Schlumberger to substantially increase the recovery of oil from complex production systems. And among them, Quaise team members hold several patents.

The initiative aimed at raising environmental awareness and encouraging responsible practices, culminated in a special event at Hindon Honda, Ghaziabad, in the presence of HMSI’s senior leadership including Mr. Sheshank Razdan, General Manger, Regional Business Central and Mr. Ravikumar Annasaheb Firagannavar, General Manger, Regional Business Central-Customer Service.

This year’s World Environment Day theme, ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’ shaped the direction of the on-ground activities. As part of the week-long celebration, HMSI’s dealerships and service outlets across India actively engaged with customers and local communities.

Key activities included distribution of saplings to all customers visiting at dealership, awareness campaigns on the harmful impact of plastic pollution and 1,25,000 tree plantation drives across multiple cities and towns. Free Pollution Under Control (PUC) check-up camps were also conducted to promote cleaner and more efficient vehicle usage.

In its 25th year of operations in India, HMSI has reached a significant production milestone, crossing 70 million units of cumulative production since the start of local manufacturing in 2001. This milestone contributes to Honda’s achievement of cumulative global production of motorcycles which has reached 500 million units, since 1949.

As the production scales, HMSI remains aligned with Honda’s global vision of realising zero environmental impact not only with its products, but throughout the entire product lifecycle including all corporate activities, through its Triple Action to ZERO initiative focusing on carbon neutrality, clean energy and resource circulation.

The company continues to strengthen operational efficiencies while promoting cleaner technologies and manufacturing processes across its facilities. The Environment Week initiative highlights the role of collective participation- from customers and dealers to employees and leadership- in shaping a cleaner, greener tomorrow.

These efforts were designed to create grassroot impact, reinforcing the message that even small, everyday actions can contribute meaningfully to environmental health. The event brought together HMSI associates and local representatives for a tree plantation drive and an employee awareness session which focussed on integrating sustainability into workplace and community practices.

In parallel to these on-ground efforts, HMSI continues to integrate sustainability into its operations. The company’s third factory in Narsapura, Karnataka currently meets 98% of its energy requirements through renewable sources. Across all manufacturing locations, HMSI is expanding its capability to source over half of its total energy needs from renewable inputs.

To reduce dependency on freshwater sources and promote long-term environmental resilience, HMSI continues its journey toward water conservation by adopting advanced rainwater harvesting techniques at all its factories. The Third factory at Narsapura (Bangalore) meets its maximum water requirements through rainwater alone. All four manufacturing plants operate as Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities.

All HMSI plants have been awarded the prestigious GreenCo World Class rating, achieving Platinum and Platinum plus levels. The company has also received several national accolades, including the National Energy and Water Awards, in recognition of its unwavering commitment to sustainability.

With both on-ground and long-term investments in clean manufacturing, HMSI’s celebration highlights a broader approach to supporting a sustainable future through awareness, action and innovation.

Since 2018, EPA has provided over $200 million to help reduce exposure to lead in drinking water where children learn and play.

“Lead is a neurotoxin that can negatively impact American children. With $26 million in funding this year, more schools will be able to identify sources of lead in their water and take action so that our nation’s children can focus on learning, playing, and developing skills that will maximize their potential and make our nation stronger,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“Reducing childhood exposure to lead is an investment in Texas’s future. The WIIN grants are an important part of EPA’s commitment to ensuring schools and childcare centers are safe, healthy locations for kids to grow and thrive,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason.

EPA will allocate grant funding to states and territories through the Voluntary School and Child Care Lead Testing and Reduction Grant Program. Total allotment amounts for each of the 50 states, DC, and four territories can be found on the grant website. Tribal allotments for this program will be released separately.

The EPA is committed to protecting children and communities across America from lead in drinking water. In addition to this grant program, EPA’s Training, Testing, and Taking Action program (3Ts) provides information and recommendations to help states and local authorities build voluntary programs to reduce lead in drinking water. Since 2019, this effort has helped over 20,000 child care facilities and nearly 13,000 schools have their water tested for lead with over 1,300 child care facilities and 2,500 schools completing remediation work.

With the help of this grant, Texas has sampled approximately 97% of the approximately 1,552 school and child care facilities they planned to test. This success is thanks to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s free program to conduct voluntary sampling and analysis for lead in drinking water.

“The scale of these contributions appears to be unprecedented in Virginia Attorney General races,” the officials said.
The intra-party split is playing out again in this year’s attorney general race.
Earlier this month, Jones also received $1,000 from a Dominion Energy executive, complicating his allies’ criticism of Taylor.
Rothman, Jones’s campaign manager, said, “Virginia needs an Attorney General who fights for Virginians first.","Both candidates for Virginia attorney general in Tuesday’s Democratic primary have much in common. They’ve both promised, for instance, to fight against Donald Trump and DOGE, and to protect abortion rights.

When it comes to who is funding their campaigns, though, there’s one source of cash that marks a striking difference between the candidates: Dominion Energy, the Fortune 500 utility company that has long thrown around huge sums to shape politics in Virginia.

In the attorney general primary this year, local prosecutor Shannon Taylor has accepted $650,000 in donations from Dominion, while former state delegate Jay Jones has not taken any from the company.

And that cash has made a difference: Jones had a significant fundraising lead this year — until Dominion began sending checks to Taylor.

The spending split shows how Dominion continues to shape Democratic politics in the state, six years after party leaders said they would refuse donations from the controversial electricity monopoly. In response to Dominion’s attorney general race donations, 14 current and former Democratic officials aligned with Jones wrote a letter this week calling out Taylor for what they said was a looming conflict of interest.

“The scale of these contributions appears to be unprecedented in Virginia Attorney General races,” the officials said. “This level of corporate influence over a candidate seeking the state’s highest law enforcement position undermines public confidence in the independence and integrity of the office.”

Hitting a theme of her long experience as a prosecutor, Taylor’s campaign said in a statement, “Shannon is the only Democrat who can be trusted to flip this seat and fight back against Donald Trump.”

In a statement, Jones’s campaign manager Rachel Rothman took a swipe at Taylor’s reliance on Dominion cash. She said, “Shannon Taylor is clearly aspiring to be Dominion’s in-house counsel.”

Power Player

Nobody in Virginia politics has a pocketbook quite like Dominion. The company is the leading campaign contributor this election cycle, according to the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project. For years, it has showered candidates with what one observer called a “staggering” amount of cash.

Meanwhile, the company has faced complaints about its business.

Dominion has been accused of overcharging customers by $1.2 billion over a yearslong period, slowing efforts to develop rooftop solar energy, and threatening the climate with a since-canceled natural gas pipeline.

Dominion’s political vise grip allowed it to get away with it all, critics said.

In recent years, however, that grip has loosened. Responding to outrage from voters, the Democratic Party announced that it would no longer accept donations from Dominion — though individual candidates were not obliged to follow suit.

Some Democrats have continued to take money from the company, while others have aligned themselves with the Clean Virginia Fund, a political organization created by a wealthy Charlottesville investor named Michael Bills to combat Dominion’s influence in state politics.

In 2018, then-attorney general Mark Herring, a Democrat, said he would stop taking money from Dominion. That did not stop the company from donating in 2021 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association, which spent on ads to support Herring when he was fighting a primary battle against Jones. The donation was not made public until after Jones had lost the race.

The intra-party split is playing out again in this year’s attorney general race.

Dominion, which partnered with environmental groups on an unsuccessful clean energy bill last year, defended its involvement in state politics in a prepared statement.

“Like most companies, we participate in the political process on behalf of our thousands of employees and millions of customers,” said Aaron Ruby, a company spokesperson. “They depend on us for reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy. We contribute to candidates from both parties in support of common sense public policy.”

An Equalizer

The Virginia attorney general race is one of this year’s marquee contests. Because the state has a large contingent of federal workers affected by DOGE cuts and the office’s ability to challenge actions by the administration, the race viewed as a bellwether for how Trump’s second term is going over with voters.

Dominion has its own reasons for being interested. The attorney general’s office also plays an important role in utility regulation in the state. In 2022, Jason Miyares, a Republican and the current attorney general, tangled with Dominion Energy over whether a large offshore wind project did enough to protect ratepayers from potential cost overruns before reaching an agreement.

The massive donations to Taylor have helped her even out Jones’s fundraising advantage. Jones has won endorsements from centrist Democrats such as former Virginia governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, as well as national figures like Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Along the way, Jones raised $2.7 million compared to Taylor’s $2.1 million. Jones’s major contributors include the Clean Virginia Fund, which has given his campaign nearly $579,000, according to disclosures.

Prolific campaign spending by Bills, the Clean Virginia Fund founder, has drawn criticisms of its own from observers who say it is drowning out small-dollar donors.

Earlier this month, Jones also received $1,000 from a Dominion Energy executive, complicating his allies’ criticism of Taylor. Jones’s campaign said they are refunding the money.

Both candidates have criticized Miyares for not doing enough to fight back against Trump, and both have promised to fight for abortion rights.

Jones has pointed to his experience fighting for consumer rights as a lawyer at the D.C. attorney general’s office and his legal fights with the administration of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin over voting rights.

Taylor, the commonwealth attorney for Henrico County, has leaned heavily on her experience as a criminal prosecutor. In a statement responding to the letter from Democratic officials criticizing the Dominion donation, Taylor repeated her allegation that Jones lacks the experience to serve as the state’s top law enforcement official.

“Jay Jones has never prosecuted a case and spent less than 10 months in the DC AGs office,” the release said. “Shannon spent 30 years prosecuting thousands of cases to protect Virginia families and hold fraudsters accountable.”

Taylor also called out a few thousand dollars that Jones took from lobbyists associated with Dominion Energy between 2021 and 2024, and donations from the company itself in 2017 and 2018.

Rothman, Jones’s campaign manager, said, “Virginia needs an Attorney General who fights for Virginians first. That candidate is Jay Jones.”

Trump's Bill Would End EV Subsidies: Is Rivian in Trouble?","Key Points

Rivian is prepared to grow sales significantly regardless of tax incentives.

But eliminating tax incentives could have an odd effect on Rivian's competitiveness.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a very promising future. Starting in early 2026, management expects to start production of three new affordable electric vehicles (EVs). Making affordable EVs priced under $50,000 is a huge milestone for an automaker. When Tesla released its affordable Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, sales boomed. Today, those two vehicles account for more than 90% of Tesla's auto sales.

Some recent news, however, could be a giant blow to Rivian's growth plans. President Donald Trump's new bill proposes cutting federal EV tax credits, which would make electric vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive to buyers. How much will Rivian suffer? The answer might surprise you.

Rivian can afford to reach its next growth catalyst

Many investors are looking over electric car stocks to find the next Tesla. It's a worthy mission. Tesla shares have risen 23,000% in value since 2010. What's the key to spotting the next Tesla? Look for companies that can launch affordable models priced under $50,000. As mentioned, reaching this milestone creates a gigantic growth catalyst, making the automakers' models affordable to tens of millions of new buyers.

Right now, Rivian is right on track. After releasing two luxury models with premium price tags -- very similar to what Tesla achieved with its Model S and Model X vehicles -- Rivian is preparing to start production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X. Production is slated to begin in early 2026, but I'm not expecting full production of all three models until 2027 or 2028. Still, there's no doubt that Rivian is prepared to hit its biggest growth milestone in years. With $4.7 billion in cash on the books, plus a deal with Volkswagen that could deliver several more billion dollars in capital, Rivian looks like it has the means to get these vehicles to market. That will allow sales to surge, and also provide significantly more operational leverage, likely improving profit margins.

Regardless of whether the EV tax credits are eliminated, Rivian has the capital to reach this growth catalyst, meaning sales growth should be expected whatever the future brings. Right now, Rivian's vehicles are priced between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on the exact package. If the company can price three new vehicles under the $50,000 mark, that makes its lineup significantly more affordable even without a tax incentive. In fact, eliminating the EV tax credit could end up helping Rivian long-term.

Could the Trump bill actually help Rivian?

It should be stressed that Trump's bill to eliminate EV tax credits is only a bill right now. It has a long way yet to becoming law. But if these eliminations are put into place, expect EV demand to drop over the near term. EVs are already struggling to maintain cost competitiveness versus gas or diesel engines. Adding $4,000 to $7,500 to the final cost should eliminate many potential buyers, especially those seeking long-term cost savings. Rivian also generates ""free"" income by selling automotive regulatory credits -- a major factor in the company achieving positive gross margins in recent quarters. Like Tesla, however, most of these credits are earned by state programs like California's, making them unlikely to be cut anytime soon.

The important thing to note here is that most North American automakers don't yet have an affordable electric vehicle on the market, though most are trying. Consider Lucid Group, which aims to release several new mass market vehicles over the coming years. The company has less than $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and will almost certainly need more capital to get these cars to market. If its existing luxury models become even more expensive, that could lower demand and access to capital, making it harder for the company to actually get its affordable models to market. It's very possible the company could face severe financial uncertainty should these tax incentives be eliminated.

Rivian, meanwhile, is already profitable on a gross margin basis, unlike Lucid, though it does partially rely on federal automotive regulatory credits to achieve this.. It's also much further along in the development of its affordable models than Lucid, making it much more likely it actually gets these models to market. If other competitors struggle financially due to lower EV tax incentives, it's possible Rivian could gain long-term. However, it should be noted that over the short term, Rivian should take a direct demand hit.

The result is a mixed bag for Rivian. Demand would fall near-term due to higher costs for consumers. But a lessening of competition and investment by peers like Lucid Group could open up more long-term market share.

Starting in early 2026, management expects to start production of three new affordable electric vehicles (EVs). Making affordable EVs priced under $50,000 is a huge milestone for an automaker. When Tesla released its affordable Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, sales boomed. Today, those two vehicles account for more than 90% of Tesla's auto sales.

Some recent news, however, could be a giant blow to Rivian's growth plans. President Donald Trump's new bill proposes cutting federal EV tax credits, which would make electric vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive to buyers. How much will Rivian suffer? The answer might surprise you.

Rivian can afford to reach its next growth catalyst

Many investors are looking over electric car stocks to find the next Tesla. It's a worthy mission. Tesla shares have risen 23,000% in value since 2010. What's the key to spotting the next Tesla? Look for companies that can launch affordable models priced under $50,000. As mentioned, reaching this milestone creates a gigantic growth catalyst, making the automakers' models affordable to tens of millions of new buyers.

Right now, Rivian is right on track. After releasing two luxury models with premium price tags -- very similar to what Tesla achieved with its Model S and Model X vehicles -- Rivian is preparing to start production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X. Production is slated to begin in early 2026, but I'm not expecting full production of all three models until 2027 or 2028. Still, there's no doubt that Rivian is prepared to hit its biggest growth milestone in years. With $4.7 billion in cash on the books, plus a deal with Volkswagen that could deliver several more billion dollars in capital, Rivian looks like it has the means to get these vehicles to market. That will allow sales to surge, and also provide significantly more operational leverage, likely improving profit margins.

Regardless of whether the EV tax credits are eliminated, Rivian has the capital to reach this growth catalyst, meaning sales growth should be expected whatever the future brings. Right now, Rivian's vehicles are priced between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on the exact package. If the company can price three new vehicles under the $50,000 mark, that makes its lineup significantly more affordable even without a tax incentive. In fact, eliminating the EV tax credit could end up helping Rivian long-term.

Could the Trump bill actually help Rivian?

It should be stressed that Trump's bill to eliminate EV tax credits is only a bill right now. It has a long way yet to becoming law. But if these eliminations are put into place, expect EV demand to drop over the near term. EVs are already struggling to maintain cost competitiveness versus gas or diesel engines.

In terms of the primary goal of this spending, reducing Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030, the latest available government data from 2023 shows emissions were just 8.5% below 2005 levels.

Achieving the Liberals’ 2030 target will require the equivalent of eliminating all annual emissions from Canada’s transportation and building sectors in seven years, which would inevitably cause a massive recession.

When environmental commissioner Jerry V. DeMarco audited 20 of the government’s 149 programs, he found fewer than half were on track to achieve their goals and of 32 additional measures the government claimed would assist in reaching the 2030 target, only seven were new.

His audit uncovered examples where two different government programs were funding the same projects and reporting the same expected emission cuts, raising the possibility of double counting.

DeMarco said the government’s lack of transparency in reporting emissions made it impossible for the average citizen to understand its claims.

The computer modelling used to estimate emissions was also out of date and “recent decreases to projected 2030 emissions were not due to climate action taken by governments, but were instead because of revisions to the data used in modelling.”

DeMarco noted that aside from falling far short of its emission targets, Canada has the worst record of reducing emissions of any member of the G7, including the U.S.

The U.S. has cut emissions at almost double Canada’s rate, without imposing a national carbon tax.

In terms of getting value for money, auditor general Karen Hogan reported last year that in one of the government’s 149 climate programs – the now-disbanded $1-billion Sustainable Development Technology Fund – there were 90 cases where conflict-of-interest rules were ignored in awarding $76 million worth of government contracts and 10 cases where $56 million was awarded to ineligible projects.

DeMarco reported last week that despite spending over $6.6 billion on government programs to help Canadians adapt to more severe weather caused by climate change since 2015, the Liberals’ national adaptation strategy, released in 2023, lacked essential elements to make it effective and progress since then has been slow.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux last year estimated the cost of government subsidies to Canada’s auto sector to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries at up to $52.5 billion on 13 major projects – $31.4 billion, or 60%, paid by federal taxpayers and $21.1 billion, or 40%, paid by provincial taxpayers in Ontario and Quebec.

That’s $6.3 billion more than the announced investments of $46.1 billion the auto sector is contributing to these projects, with many now delayed due to slower than anticipated EV sales.

While Canada’s employment rate and economic growth are influenced by many factors, the Liberals have repeatedly promised since coming to power in 2015 that government spending on their climate policies would lead to significant increases in jobs and economic growth, which has not been the case.

Statistics Canada reported earlier this month that Canada’s unemployment rate rose to 7% in May, the highest it’s been since September 2016, excluding the 2020 and 2021 pandemic years, and a 12.9% increase from 6.2% a year ago in May.

When DeMarco reported in 2023 on the Liberals’ so-called “just transition” plan to assist energy sector workers to retrain for Canada’s new green economy, he concluded it didn’t exist, despite the government having promised it in 2019.

“We found that as Canada shifts focus to low-carbon alternatives, the government is not prepared to provide appropriate support to … workers in the fossil fuel sector,” DeMarco said.

“The transition was being handled on a business-as-usual basis, relying on existing program mechanisms such as the employment insurance program to deliver support.”

(Eventually the Liberals passed what they called the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act in 2024, with many of these concerns still outstanding.)

In terms of economic growth, Statistics Canada reported earlier this year that Canada’s real GDP per capita, which measures economic output per person, adjusted for inflation, and is a widely accepted metric for measuring the standard of living, fell by 1.4% in 2024, following a decline of 1.3% in 2023.

Over its near-decade in power, Canada’s economic growth under the Liberals has been the lowest since the government of R.B. Bennett during the Great Depression.

As the country strives to meet its ambitious targets, integrating energy storage solutions and smart grid technologies is becoming increasingly vital.

1. Solar energy storage: A critical enabler

Energy storage systems (ESS) are essential for addressing the intermittent nature of solar power. They store excess energy generated during peak sunlight hours and release it during periods of low generation or high demand, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.

Recent developments

Delhi’s 20-MW Battery Energy Storage System: In a significant move, Delhi inaugurated South Asia’s largest 20-MW ESS at the BRPL substation in Kilokari. This system, capable of delivering 40 MWh, will provide four hours of reliable power daily, benefiting over 100,000 residents in south Delhi’s densely populated Kilokari area. The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology ensures thermal stability, safety, and durability, operating efficiently under Delhi’s varied climates.

Kerala’s Battery Storage Initiative: The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) has set a 12-year lifespan for standalone ESS and introduced a streamlined registration process for renewable energy projects. This move aims to enhance the efficiency and adoption of ESS in the state.

Policy support

The Indian government has recognised the importance of ESS in the renewable energy sector:

Mandatory Co-location of ESS with Solar Projects: The Ministry of Power has mandated that all renewable energy implementing agencies and state utilities incorporate a minimum of two-hour co-located ESS, equivalent to 10 per cent of the installed solar project capacity, in future solar tenders. This requirement aims to mitigate intermittency issues and provide critical support during peak demand periods. The government expects around 14 GW/28 GWh of storage to be installed by 2030.

Financial Incentives: The government has allocated INR 19,500 crore for solar PV modules in the 2024 Union budget, a 143 per cent increase from the previous year. Additionally, a 10 per cent customs duty on solar glass imports is set to commence in October 2024, with exemptions for certain components to encourage domestic manufacturing.

2. Smart grids: The backbone of modern energy systems

Smart grids integrate digital technology into the electricity network, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and optimisation of the generation, distribution, and consumption of electricity. They play a crucial role in accommodating the variable nature of solar energy and enhancing grid resilience.

Key initiatives

Lakshadweep decarbonisation plan: The Central Electricity Authority is preparing a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy for the Lakshadweep islands, incorporating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, along with ESS, to ensure efficient energy storage and reliability.

Gujarat hybrid renewable energy park: Under construction in Kutch district, this park aims to be the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park, generating 30 GW from solar panels and wind turbines. The integration of smart grid technologies will facilitate efficient energy distribution and management across the vast area.

Challenges and solutions

Grid infrastructure: The existing grid infrastructure in many parts of India is outdated and ill-equipped to handle the influx of decentralised solar power. Upgrading and modernising the grid is essential to accommodate the growing share of renewable energy.

Data management: Smart grids generate vast amounts of data that need to be processed and analysed in real time. Investing in advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and grid optimisation.

The road ahead

India’s commitment to expanding its solar energy capacity is evident in its policies and initiatives. The integration of ESS and smart grid technologies is pivotal to achieving a reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy system. Continued investment in infrastructure, technology, and human capital will be crucial in realising the full potential of solar energy in India",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/06/14/Kamini-Gupta-Communication-Manager-AXITEC-Energy-India-Pvt.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 17:04:25.425906

The investment confirmed in the Spending Review is a major boost to the UK’s ambitions to become a clean energy superpower and to support industrial regions including Teesside, Merseyside, the Humber and Scotland.

The development of a hydrogen transport and storage network is essential for building a UK-wide market, connecting production with end users such as power stations and industrial clusters. This infrastructure is the foundation for scaling up both hydrogen produced with carbon capture and hydrogen produced with electrolysis, and for repurposing much of the UK’s existing natural gas infrastructure.

Today’s funding can help unlock long-term secure jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and the wider energy supply chain. OEUK’s members are already investing in carbon capture and hydrogen projects that could support thousands of skilled roles across the country, particularly in places where economic renewal is needed most.

But to make hydrogen competitive, early investments must be supported by a clear regulatory framework and investable business models.

That’s why OEUK is now calling on government to work with industry to ensure this funding has the best possible impact and accelerates enabling policies that reduce costs and de-risk private investment

Hydrogen will play a vital role in decarbonising sectors such as steel, glass, ceramics, and refining but it will only succeed if a stable market is created that attracts investors.

OEUK is ready to work with government and industry partners to deliver the next phase, turning this funding into real-world jobs, projects, and progress toward net zero.

Commenting, OEUK’s Head of Energy Policy, Enrique Cornejo, said:

'If we are serious about getting to net zero hydrogen must be a key piece of the puzzle for decarbonising heavy industry, power, and enabling energy storage but it must be made affordable and attractive to the companies that need to bring it to life.

'Because it is expensive the government is right to focus deployment in sectors where it offers most value. For hydrogen to become competitive there must be cost reductions which will only be achieved if we initiate early investments and learn from them.

'Developing a strong hydrogen sector is critical to our industrial future, and the UK’s oil and gas supply chain has the skills and capabilities to accelerate progress.'

Currently about $1.2 billion a year goes toward ocean protection globally.
Activists have been pushing the French government to announce a ban on bottom trawling in its marine protected areas.
This falls short of an existing European Union goal of placing 10 percent of its waters under “strict protection,” without commercial fishing of any kind.
John Kerry, the former special presidential envoy for climate under President Biden, said he didn’t know what role the United States would play in ocean protection now.","Remote coral atolls in the Caribbean. Habitat for threatened sharks and rays around a Tanzanian island in the Indian Ocean. And 900,000 square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean around French Polynesia.

These are some of the millions of acres of water now set aside as part of an international goal to protect 30 percent of the ocean by 2030. More than 20 new marine protected areas were announced at the third United Nations Ocean Conference, which ended on Friday in France.

Countries and territories pledging new areas included Chile; Colombia; French Polynesia; Portugal; Samoa; Sao Tome and Principe; the Solomon Islands; Tanzania; and Vanuatu.

“Protecting the ocean is beginning to become fashionable,” said Sylvia Earle, a marine biologist and oceanographer who served as chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the 1990s, at an event celebrating a network of protected areas around the Azores.

The new designations come at a time when the United States, which sent only two observers to the conference, has moved to reopen the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument to commercial fishing. The country is also seeking to unilaterally authorize mining of the seafloor in international waters.

France, which hosted the conference with Costa Rica, pushed for a moratorium on deep sea mining, with four new countries pledging their support this week, bringing the total to 37 countries.

Less than 3 percent of the ocean is currently fully protected from “extractive” activities like commercial fishing and mining, according to the Marine Protection Atlas.

In order to reach the goal, the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement, also known as the High Seas Treaty, needs to be enforced with at least 60 countries ratifying it. At the conference, 19 new countries ratified the treaty, bringing the total to 50 individual countries plus the European Union. Once active, the treaty would provide a pathway toward protecting stretches of the ocean beyond individual countries’ borders.

And in coastal waters within those borders, much remains to be done. A study published in May found that the average marine protected area today is about 10 square kilometers, meaning about 188,000 more areas of that size are needed — or 85 new marine protected areas a day.

These numbers are “super daunting,” said the report’s lead author Kristin Rechberger, who is chief executive of the conservation organization Dynamic Planet. She wants countries to break through the challenge by decentralizing marine protection and allowing coastal communities to create their own small protected areas at a faster pace.

A separate report published last week found that countries need to raise $15.8 billion a year in order to protect 30 percent of the ocean. Currently about $1.2 billion a year goes toward ocean protection globally.

Questions also remain about how meaningful existing protections are.

Activists have been pushing the French government to announce a ban on bottom trawling in its marine protected areas. President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would place 4 percent of its mainland waters under “strong protection,” limiting bottom trawling, a fishing process that drags nets along the seafloor. This falls short of an existing European Union goal of placing 10 percent of its waters under “strict protection,” without commercial fishing of any kind.

“Allowing destructive bottom trawling in most of France’s so-called ‘protected’ areas makes a mockery of ocean protection,” said Alexandra Cousteau, senior adviser to Oceana and granddaughter of the ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, in a written statement. “It’s like building a fence around a forest and then bulldozing it anyway.”

Even where protections from commercial fishing exist around the world, enforcement is often lacking.

Zafer Kizilkaya, president of the Mediterranean Conservation Society, has worked with local fishing communities to create and patrol a marine protected area at Gokova Bay in Turkey, allowing endangered monk seals to return. Community members — including former fishers — serve as marine rangers, reporting illegal commercial fishing to the Turkish Coast Guard, which follows up with fines.

Mr. Kizilkaya is not seeking greater percentages of protected marine areas at this point, but rather “serious enforcement and management,” he said. “That will make a huge difference.”

The United States did not send an official delegation to the conference. Two representatives from the the administration’s Environmental Advisory Task Force, including Ed Russo, the chairman, attended as what the State Department called “government observers.”

The day before the conference began, Mr. Russo wrote an opinion piece in Time magazine with Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce and owner of Time, outlining ideas for a “focused, global effort to restore coral reefs.”

“We believe that addressing coral-reef health is a smart place to focus — not because it is the only crisis,” they wrote, “but because it offers a clear, actionable, achievable goal that can unite governments and ocean advocates.”

Mr. Russo and Mr. Benioff did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Russo is chief executive of RussKap Water, president of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition and a board member of Reef Relief.

Mr. Benioff, who during the first Trump administration raised Republican support for an initiative to plant a trillion trees, has funded a center for marine conservation called the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Salesforce was a major sponsor of the U.N. ocean conference’s publicly accessible exhibits.

Highly treated wastewater has been pumped up from Lake and Sonoma counties to injection wells over the past decades to recharge that steam reservoir.
Because of depletion of that reservoir and concerns from environmental regulators about dangerous gases emerging from deep underground, some wells have been closed and steam production at some remaining wells has declined.
GreenFire officials said the results signal the system’s scalability to other low-output wells, a major step forward in revitalizing aging geothermal infrastructure.
Sonoma Clean Power has been spearheading a GeoZone program to attract next-generation geothermal projects to the North Bay.","California’s goal of producing more round-the-clock power from The Geysers may be in reach, as a demonstration there of next-generation geothermal energy technology has become operational and is said to be generating promising early results.

The project is part of a multipronged effort to increase electrical output for the North Bay and throughout California from what’s still the world’s largest geothermal energy field despite declining steam production at the plants in the Mayacamas range between Sonoma and Lake counties.

Oklahoma City-based GreenFire Energy last month announced that its first commercial demonstration system, installed in a low-output well at The Geysers, is now fully operational. The well, previously nearing idle status, is producing sustained flow rates of 300–350 gallons per minute with unexpectedly high-output temperatures of 310 degrees Fahrenheit, all within a closed-loop system.

GreenFire’s patented “GreenLoop” system relies on pipe-enclosed fluid that goes down into the well cool, gets heated then comes back up to release the heat into a electricity-generation system. This fluid has a lower boiling point than water, requiring less heat to produce steam.

Such closed-loop systems don’t rely on groundwater to infiltrate the hot rock to be turned into steam and captured at the surface. Highly treated wastewater has been pumped up from Lake and Sonoma counties to injection wells over the past decades to recharge that steam reservoir.

Because of depletion of that reservoir and concerns from environmental regulators about dangerous gases emerging from deep underground, some wells have been closed and steam production at some remaining wells has declined.

Generation at The Geysers peaked at about 2 gigawatts in 1987 and has been between 600 and 700 megawatts in recent years. A megawatt powers about 1,000 typical homes.

“This is a breakthrough — not just for our team, but for the future of geothermal,” said Rob Klenner, president of GreenFire Energy, in the announcement. “We’re delivering on our promises to show how next-gen technology can provide high-performance power with real commercial applications.”

The company’s stated goal is to bring 150 megawatts of geothermal capacity online by 2030, targeting sectors from manufacturing to data centers.

The Geysers project — hosted by Calpine Corporation subsidiary Geysers Power Company at its Bear Canyon Unit 2 plant in Lake County — is designed to test how efficient the energy transfer can be between the hot well and the loop liquid while preserving water mass in the steam-dominated reservoir.

Calpine and GreenFire didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Funded in part by a $2.7 million California Energy Commission grant, the demonstration includes two completed seven-day production tests and a nearly finished steady-state performance test. GreenFire officials said the results signal the system’s scalability to other low-output wells, a major step forward in revitalizing aging geothermal infrastructure.

GreenFire’s success arrives at a pivotal time. Sonoma Clean Power has been spearheading a GeoZone program to attract next-generation geothermal projects to the North Bay. GeoZone is a partnership with local counties and three energy company developers to create a renewable energy development zone focused on geothermal and other clean sources to serve Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties.

""We're trying to make California the place that developments can drive forward fastest,"" said Miles Horton, legislative policy and community engagement manager for the power agency.

The agency is backing two key bills aimed at creating a more competitive regulatory environment. Assembly Bill 527 would provide California Environmental Quality Act exemptions for geothermal exploration. AB 531 would allow geothermal projects of any size to use a streamlined permitting process, while the current cutoff is for plants above 50 megawatts.

""We have the demand here in California for clean baseload power,"" Horton said.

The ultimate goal remains expanding geothermal capacity by 600 megawatts in The Geysers, which Horton compared to 2 gigawatts of solar production capacity because it generates whether the sun is shinging or not.

“The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.” Naturally, when you kill the tax credits, you kill projects, you kill jobs, and you kill whole companies.
Just directly influenced manufacturing jobs alone, the bill puts nearly 300,000 jobs at risk.
“Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits,” the BlueGreen Alliance states.
“With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%.","For the past few weeks — or months — we’ve been covering the risks of Congress and Donald Trump repealing the the Clean Manufacturing Tax Credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In the past week, now that a Republican House bill repealing them has been passed to the Senate, a number of reports and press statements have come out highlighting how many jobs could be lost in different sectors and how much economic harm the repeals could do. Now we’ve got another big one to share.

The analysis from the BlueGreen Alliance shows that “more than two million jobs across the manufacturing employment footprint are at risk if the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives becomes law,” the Alliance writes. “The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.” Naturally, when you kill the tax credits, you kill projects, you kill jobs, and you kill whole companies.

Just directly influenced manufacturing jobs alone, the bill puts nearly 300,000 jobs at risk. Then, another one million plus indirect jobs related to the supply chains of these factories are also at risk. Going further (because that’s how the economy work), another ~643,000 induced jobs are also at risk. Therefore, in total, more than 2 million jobs are determined to be at risk.

Regarding the direct job losses, the Alliance notes: “These numbers are drawn directly from company announcements and exclude job creation connected to projects that have already been cancelled.”

Perhaps 2 million isn’t the actual number in reality. Perhaps some mistakes were made in the analysis. But, even if that was the case, without a doubt, numerous jobs will be lost. The economic harm will be immense.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

The BlueGreen Alliance also highlighted that there are seven states that have more than 100,000 jobs at risk from the Republican bill. Those are a mixture of “blue” and “red” states: California, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Arizona, and South Carolina. “Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election,” the BlueGreen Alliance adds. Here are more details on how those numbers break down:

California – 329,131

Georgia – 258,517

Michigan – 226,610

Tennessee – 140,985

Illinois – 138,214

South Carolina – 135,510

Arizona – 100,170

Manufacturing facilities aren’t built overnight. They require long-term planning and development. With Inflation Reduction Act only passed about two and a half years ago, we’re still at the baby stages of what could be created from it. Unfortunately, that also means that, because the big positive effects haven’t sprouted yet, it’s easier for Republicans to stomp on the seeds and prevent factories and jobs from being created rather than trying to shut them down in future years.

“Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits,” the BlueGreen Alliance states. “With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.”

To close, the Alliance puts out one more appeal for common sense, just as more than a dozen Republicans in the House have done (despite also letting the bill get to the Senate as it is). “The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”

It just doesn’t make sense that one of our major political parties would be so adamant about hurting the US cleantech industry and economy, but that’s where we are thanks to the party being slaves to the fossil fuel industry.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BlueGreen-Alliance-budget-bill-job-losses.png,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:17.744922

In 2022, solar energy offset over 140 million metric tons of CO₂ globally.
A single home solar system prevents around 3 tons of CO₂ every year.
In Q2 2024, solar power cost was 3–6 cents per kWh—cheaper than coal or gas.
About AM Global Solar AM Global Solar, based in the U.S., helps homes and businesses go solar.","In the U.S., the top reason people choose solar is to save money. A study from Ohio State found that cost savings are the biggest driver for homeowners choosing solar. On average, U.S. households save about $1,500 a year with solar power. Over time, that adds up to tens of thousands of dollars.

For example, if panels cost $18,000, a $1,500 annual saving means a system may pay for itself in 6 to 8 years. After that, those savings go straight to your wallet.

Ways Solar Lowers Costs:

Reduces or eliminates electricity bills

Locks in stable energy prices

Benefits from net metering—selling extra power back to the grid

Tax Credits and Incentives

Federal and state programs make solar more affordable. The U.S. offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under the Inflation Reduction Act. That means if your system costs $20,000, you could get a $6,000 tax credit.

Some states add extra rebates. California even allows solar systems to be exempt from property tax and offers fast permits. Common costs and incentives are shown below:

Cost Item Amount Benefit System cost $3–6 per watt 20-year lifespan Federal ITC 30% Reduces upfront costs Average annual savings $1,500 Up to 50% off energy bills

Solar Helps the Environment

Solar power creates clean energy and helps cut carbon pollution. In 2022, solar energy offset over 140 million metric tons of CO₂ globally. In the U.S., it now provides more than 40% of new electricity capacity.

A single home solar system prevents around 3 tons of CO₂ every year. Think of it as planting 100 trees annually.

Energy Independence and Grid Safety

The U.S. power grid faces aging equipment and extreme weather. Solar panels, along with battery storage, give homeowners more control. They reduce reliance on the grid. They also protect against blackouts and rising energy prices.

Adding battery storage means you have power at night or during storms. That builds energy independence.

Solar Industry Growth

Solar is booming in America. The U.S. had 239 GW of solar capacity by the end of 2024—enough to power millions of homes. In 2024, solar plants added 37 GW and utilities plan 26 GW more in 2025.

Even though federal incentives may change, experts say solar will still grow. Growth may slow, but it’s expected to bounce back as electricity becomes more expensive.

Community Solar: For Everyone

Not everyone can put panels on their roof. Community solar is changing that. It lets renters and low-income people share a local solar project. Many states support this model

Connects 6.5 GW of solar in 2024 (enough for millions of homes)

Credits appear on your bill

Helps renters and those with shaded roofs

This model is growing fast and helps build clean energy access for everyone.

Future Outlook

Experts expect solar to grow even more. The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) says solar could supply 40% of U.S. electricity by 2035. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) foresees big solar capacity additions in the next two years.

As solar prices drop and technology improves, it gets cheaper. In Q2 2024, solar power cost was 3–6 cents per kWh—cheaper than coal or gas.

He stated the aim to increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050 to help the U.S. become a global leader in nuclear energy.
However, as the U.S. relies heavily on nuclear fuel imports from Russia, it could limit the speed of expansion unless it can ramp up its domestic nuclear fuel production capabilities.
Following Trump’s announcement of his ambitious nuclear power aims, the U.S. nuclear fuel company Centrus Energy Corp. said that the domestic supply of enriched uranium must increase to ensure the future of U.S. nuclear energy.
The firm has an enrichment plant in Ohio that it expects could eventually provide a significant portion of the U.S. nuclear fuel demand.","One non-fossil fuel energy source that Trump is backing is nuclear power. The U.S. President recently announced plans to quadruple the U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050. However, several challenges must be overcome to meet this target. Firstly, building a new nuclear plant can take a decade or more, meaning that operators would have to apply for permits for new projects now to get them up and running in the coming decades. In addition, the U.S. continues to rely heavily on Russia for its Uranium, despite having introduced heavy sanctions on the country’s energy sector in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. would need to seek an alternative supply of enriched uranium, or significantly increase its domestic production, to fuel its power plants.

In May, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders entitled Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base, Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy and Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He stated the aim to increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050 to help the U.S. become a global leader in nuclear energy. He tasked the Department of Energy (DoE) with prioritising work “with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 GW of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030”. Trump also said that license decisions on the construction and operation of new reactors should be delivered in no more than 18 months.

However, as the U.S. relies heavily on nuclear fuel imports from Russia, it could limit the speed of expansion unless it can ramp up its domestic nuclear fuel production capabilities. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), In 2023, U.S. nuclear generators used 32 million pounds of imported uranium concentrate (U3O8) and only 0.05 million pounds of domestically produced U3O8. Imports contributed around 99% of the U3O8 used in the U.S. that year, mainly coming from Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

In 2023, around 27 percent of the enriched uranium used in U.S. nuclear power plants came from Russia. However, in May 2024, the U.S. banned the import of uranium products from Russia beginning in August, although companies can apply for waivers through January 1, 2028. In addition to cutting ties with Russia, the recent introduction of sweeping tariffs on imports from various countries around the globe could further hinder the country’s uranium supply chain.

As the U.S. moves away from a dependence on Russian energy, it has looked to other countries to fill the gap. Canada now contributes around 40 percent of the U.S. nuclear fuel supply, and the introduction of 10 percent tariffs on its northern neighbour could hinder this trade link. To mitigate the risk of slowing U.S. nuclear expansion due to a shortage of uranium, the U.S. must rapidly expand its domestic production capacity or face the consequences.

Following Trump’s announcement of his ambitious nuclear power aims, the U.S. nuclear fuel company Centrus Energy Corp. said that the domestic supply of enriched uranium must increase to ensure the future of U.S. nuclear energy. The firm’s CEO Amir Vexler said, “There’s barely enough Western enrichment, if at all, to satisfy existing operating plants… If the nuclear industry is to add all this generation capacity, there will have to be a tremendous amount of enrichment capacity that’s added.” Vexler added, “We don’t have any domestic fuel cycle capacity, almost at all… We don’t mine anything, we don’t convert anything. We don’t enrich anything. We rely on others. And others are all state-owned enterprises, maybe with a few minor exceptions.”

At present, France’s Orano and the British-Dutch-German consortium Urenco dominate Western enrichment capacity. While these suppliers have been historically reliable, the worsening trade war between the U.S. and the rest of the world is fuelling greater uncertainty and disrupting supply chains. Urenco owns the only domestic enrichment facility in the U.S. However, Centrus hopes to soon change this.

Centrus is the only company other than Urenco licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low-enriched uranium in the U.S. The firm has an enrichment plant in Ohio that it expects could eventually provide a significant portion of the U.S. nuclear fuel demand. Commercial operations have not yet been launched at the plant, which focuses primarily on producing a small amount of fuel for advanced reactors, known as high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, which it sells to the DoE for use in nuclear projects.

Scaling up operations to produce the more widely used low-enriched uranium, or LEU, will require some level of government support, according to Centrus. Vexler explained, “We’ve always said that it has to be a public-private partnership.” He added, “We’ve been raising our own funds. We’ve been raising our own financing. We will contribute significantly to this, but we have to have government support.”

President Trump is following in his predecessor’s footsteps with strong nuclear ambitions. However, achieving his nuclear power capacity increase target will require high levels of investment in the sector, as well as a more streamlined approach to licensing and a significant increase in the domestic production of enriched nuclear fuel.

This week, we’re focusing on how Audi is negotiating the twists and turns on the way to an electrified future.

EVs are here to stay at Audi, but a gasoline crossover SUV is still the automaker’s bestselling model, and it’s not ready to risk those sales just yet. That’s why the 2025 Audi Q5 received a top-to-bottom overhaul for this model year, bringing its tech features and styling up to date without altering the what has proven to be a very popular package. By maintaining parallel lineups of electric and internal-combustion cars, Audi hopes to give customers more choices. But that doesn’t completely level the playing field.

The new Q5 may have yesterday’s powertrain, but Audi isn’t holding back on tech. It features the same electrical architecture, operating system, and three-screen dashboard display as the latest Audi EVs, like the Q6 e-tron. So aside from a little engine noise, there’s little difference in what you can see and interact with from the driver’s seat.

It’s not just the infotainment systems. The Q5 and Q6 e-tron are close in size, with similar space for passengers across their two rows of seats. The Q6 e-tron has a bit more cargo space, but not as much as you’d think given the lack of a bulky engine, transmission, and driveshafts. The two SUVs also have similar styling but, having now driven both, we can say that the Q5 is the more pleasant of the two.

More than a difference of powertrain tech

The interiors may look similar, but the materials used in the Q5 felt nicer to the touch. And the gasoline SUV had a much more refined chassis, with crisper handling and plusher ride quality, than its EV counterpart. The base Q5 is also quicker than a base Q6 e-tron in a straight line (quicker versions of the EV are available), although the rough shifts from our test car’s dual-clutch transmission had us missing the smoother acceleration of an EV, even if it took a few more tenths of a second to reach 60 mph.

Recommended Videos

There’s also more differentiation between the Q5 and its sportier SQ5 counterpart than the Q6 e-tron and the SQ6 e-tron. The latter didn’t do much to justify its price premium over base models, but the SQ5 at least had a somewhat more vivacious character. The e-tron GT proves that Audi knows how to build a sporty EV, and there are plenty of other examples like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. But these SUVs show that it’s harder to build that level of differentiation into a mid-range electric offering like Audi’s “S” models than more extensively-engineered performance EVs.

And while some EVs have closed the price gap with combustion models, the Q6 e-tron’s $65,095 base price is a big step up from the $53,795 starting price of a Q5. Audi has done a great job of maintain parity on tech and features between gasoline and electric models, but that means the Q6 e-tron will likely appeal mainly to brand loyalists who specifically want an EV. It’s hard to imagine many powertrain-agonistic customers choosing it after driving a Q5 — or looking at its window sticker.

Policy uncertainty has automakers hedging their bets

Audi’s approach is typical of the current moment, though. In the United States, at least, automakers are settling into holding pattern on EV adoption as they look to balance unpredictable rates of EV sales and the fallout from Trump Administration policies with the need to capitalize on investments already made in EV production.

The industry is currently holding its breath as the Trump Administration undertakes a trade war with China that could affect the supply of rare earth minerals that are a key part of the EV supply chain. Automotive News reported earlier this week that automakers were “in full panic” over the rare earth situation. A framework was reportedly reached later in the week, but that’s subject to further negotiation and potential future reversals by the mercurial U.S. president.

Trump’s policies are ostensibly aimed at bringing more auto manufacturing back to the U.S., but as another big piece of news from this week shows, that doesn’t necessarily benefit EVs. General Motors announced that it would task its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan to build gasoline SUVs and pickup trucks, rather than the EVs previously planned.

The move, part of a $4 billion investment that will also bring production of the gasoline Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox to the U.S. from Mexico, was criticized by the Sierra Club, which accused GM of all but abandoning a previous “aspiration” to sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. But at an investor conference Wednesday, GM CFO Paul Jacobson defended the move as a necessary response to both Trump’s tariffs and strong demand for gasoline vehicles.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audi-sq5-grille.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:22.588479

2021 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary) This wide-open race with eight candidates — a record number for a statewide primary — narrowed in late April when then-Gov.","After Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her energy plan for the state this week, Virginia House GOP members wasted no time bashing it. Her plan emphasizes fair cost share, efficiency projects, and supporting a pilot program to handle peak energy consumption times.

“Her plan leans heavily on demand-side management: programmable thermostats, weatherization programs, utility subsidies, and incentives to reduce consumption during peak hours. That might sound reasonable in theory, but here’s the problem: managing scarcity isn’t a solution — it’s a symptom of failure,” an op-ed penned by House GOP leaders and members read.

The demand-side management they referenced is a recently-passed pilot program that requires utility companies to petition the State Corporation Commission to consider how to optimize energy use during peak times, by using virtual power plants, peak-shaving, and other incentives. Dominion is set to go before the Commission on July 15 to present its electric distribution grid plans for the pilot program.

The pilot allows homes and businesses to opt in to have their thermostats, appliances and solar arrays controlled during high-demand times. Spanberger’s plan also emphasizes weatherization of homes to limit energy waste and aims to reduce the need for additional power plants and transmission lines. Republican House lawmakers pushed back against those measures.

“No one wants to sit through a July heatwave hoping their A/C unit is grid-compliant, or that their A/C won’t be the one that someone in Richmond decides that it needs to shut off to save the grid. No one should have to worry that peak-hour surcharges or remote-control thermostats are going to make their daily life harder and more expensive,” the Republican legislators’ letter read.

Ten of the GOP House members who signed on to the letter voted in favor of Senate Bill 1100 in this year’s legislative session, which allowed the pilot program to move forward. Dels. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, Wren Williams, R-Patrick, Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, Paul Milde, R-Stafford, Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, Chad Green, R-York, and Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, added their signatures to House GOP Leader Del. Terry Kilgore’s.

Kilgore, recently selected as House Republicans’ caucus leader, sponsored a bill in 2023 that capped Dominion’s profit margin, and this year, will allow the SCC to manage the profit margin rates. The General Assembly has also recently passed legislation aimed at expanding the state’s market for Small Modular Reactors, a nuclear energy source that’s still being developed and hasn’t yet been deployed anywhere in the United States.

Virginia lawmakers pass competing proposals to encourage small modular reactor development

A House GOP spokesperson said the members who voted in favor of SB 1011 are more interested in ramping up energy production in the state to meet increasing energy needs.

Spanberger’s plan doesn’t rule out new energy projects coming to the state to help meet demand, and touts the use of “advanced energy technologies” like “modular nuclear reactors, fusion, geothermal, and hydrogen.” The framework also states her administration will “ensure regulatory agencies in Virginia such as DEQ and VDOT are adequately staffed to deliver timely responses to permit applications.” The GOP letter said they are in favor of speeding up permitting for all energy sources, not just renewable ones.

Spanberger’s energy outline doesn’t go into details on plans to expand natural gas, nuclear, wind, or solar energy sources. It does lay out ideas to ensure the SCC works with stakeholders on efficiency methods to cut back on energy use – something the GOP members took issue with.

“You don’t solve an energy shortage by asking people to get used to less. You solve it by building more power,” the letter said.

Utility rates in the PJM markets have steadily increased in recent years as brownouts in the summer months have become a growing concern. Virginia was rated as the state that received the most electricity from other states in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. GOP House members want to shift away from this heavy import of energy and boost Virginia as a player in the energy production market.

In 2020, the General Assembly passed the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that put the commonwealth into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Participating states can buy allowances of carbon emissions, and the proceeds are returned to the state for flood and energy projects. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled Virginia from RGGI, framing the additional cost to consumers for the program as a hidden tax. The withdrawal was later found to be unlawful by the courts. The state’s inclusion in the program is on hold while appeals play out in the legal system.

Spanberger’s plan suggests negotiating a deal to get the state back in on RGGI and use funding for efficiency projects.

Judge deems Youngkin’s actions to withdraw Virginia from RGGI ‘unlawful’

“Abigail consistently hears from Virginians who are facing high energy bills, and she knows affordable energy is essential for driving economic growth. That’s why her plan to make Virginians’ energy bills more affordable includes increasing local electricity generation and speeding up the timeline to bring new projects online,” a spokesperson for Spanberger said in a statement. “As Governor, Abigail will be focused on making Virginia more affordable — and she looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans alike to make it happen.”

Last week, Republican candidate for governor Winsome Earle-Sears said on the campaign trail that she wants to bolster the state’s energy profile through expanding fossil fuels and nuclear energy, according to the Prince William Times, to meet the state’s surging energy needs.

Data centers in Virginia have “substantially driven up energy demand in the state, and demand is forecast to continue growing for the foreseeable future,” a 2024 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission report found. Earle-Sears didn’t mention data centers specifically, but acknowledged that Virginia’s electricity demands have led the commonwealth to import 40% of its electricity from other states. Her administration, she said, would push for an all-of-the-above energy approach, an echo of Youngkin’s energy platform.

Earle-Sears did not respond to the Mercury’s request to elaborate on her energy platform.

As protests erupt again in Los Angeles over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and President Donald Trump’s deployment of U.S. Marines to back up the National Guard, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares isn’t blinking.

“It’s not unprecedented,” Miyares, who is seeking a second term as Virginia’s top law enforcement official, said of Trump’s decision to send troops to the streets. “President George H.W. Bush did it in 1992 during the L.A. riots. Twice the number of Marines were deployed then.”

In a wide-ranging interview at his office in Richmond earlier this week, Miyares, the son of a Cuban refugee and the first Hispanic Virginian elected statewide, insisted that what’s happening in California is the result of leadership failure.

“This is about protecting facilities and backing up law enforcement — not policing,” he said, emphasizing that peaceful protest is a hallmark of democracy, but violence is not. “When you cross the line … that is not protest, that is violence.”

In the interview, Miyares defended the use of force in Los Angeles, spoke at length about his office’s crime-fighting initiatives and touted settlements with corporate polluters and opioid makers. He also fielded questions on civil rights enforcement, voting access, utility regulation and his complex views on criminal justice reform.

Democrats, not surprisingly, remain deeply skeptical of Miyares’ record.

Carolyn Fiddler, spokeswoman for the Democratic Attorneys General Association, dismissed his claims of prioritizing public safety.

“Throughout his time as AG, MAGA Miyares continuously put politics before people,” Fiddler said in an email. “While he touts his ‘tough on crime’ stance, he’s failed to call out Donald Trump and Elon Musk for blatant violations of the law — including those actions with devastating impacts on the commonwealth. Virginians deserve better than Miyares, and we will take back the seat this year.”

And while critics accuse him of being more focused on punishment than reform, Miyares says his approach is guided by listening, law enforcement feedback, and a “victim-first” mindset.

From Virginia Beach to the statewide stage

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina and raised in Virginia Beach, Miyares, 49, earned his law degree from the College of William & Mary and worked as a prosecutor before running for office.

In 2015, he became the first Cuban American elected to Virginia’s General Assembly. Six years later, he unseated Democratic incumbent Mark Herring to become attorney general, winning on a platform centered around public safety.

Now, as he runs for reelection, Miyares is highlighting what he calls some of the biggest public safety and civil litigation wins in Virginia history. But he’s also navigating internal GOP rifts, pressure from both the right and the center, and a polarized electorate that’s increasingly skeptical of tough-on-crime rhetoric.

“I think one of the most important things for a leader to do is just listen,” Miyares said.

Since taking office in 2022, Miyares has zeroed in on violent crime. He calls Operation Ceasefire, a grant-driven program launched in 13 Virginia cities, one of his proudest achievements. The initiative funds a mix of prevention, intervention, and prosecution strategies aimed at repeat violent offenders.

“We saw a 66% drop in the murder rate across the 13 cities,” Miyares said. “Virginia’s statewide murder rate fell by a third. We also saw a decline in overdose deaths — because we’re getting fentanyl dealers off the street.”

The program, he insists, is based on listening tours he conducted with police and community leaders around the state. “Roughly 5% of felons commit over 50% of violent crimes. If you want to lower crime, you go after that small subset.”

Still, sustaining the initiative may prove difficult amid budget fights. “I wish we could expand Operation Ceasefire to more cities,” Miyares acknowledged, hinting that local buy-in has been mixed. “I wish more commonwealth’s attorneys would heed my call to listen to victims. Too many haven’t.”

When asked whether his office has done enough to address police misconduct, Miyares pointed to his 2023 settlement with the Town of Windsor, where officers had unlawfully stopped and threatened a Black Army lieutenant.

“You can be pro-law enforcement and still demand accountability,” he said. “They’re the only ones with a monopoly on violence in our society — they should be held to a higher standard.”

He added that oversight takes time. “We want to be thorough and systematic. And yes, if any other department crosses that boundary, we’ll get involved.”

That approach hasn’t stopped critics from accusing Miyares of being too soft on departments that violate civil rights — an accusation he flatly rejects. “The facts don’t support that claim,” he said.

Still, Miyares makes clear that his office prioritizes public safety above political fashion. “I will not support a criminal-first, victim-last mindset,” he said. “We’ve heard a lot about reform, but rarely do you hear the word ‘victim’ in those debates. That ends with me.”

Taking on corporations

Miyares has also overseen a wave of settlements that he says bring real change to communities.

“We’ve secured over $1.3 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors,” he said. Some of that money, he said, helped open a new inpatient treatment center in Abingdon — “the first of its kind within a 100-mile radius.”

He emphasized that the money is managed by Virginia’s Opioid Abatement Authority, not his office, to ensure transparency and local tailoring. “What works in Fairfax may not work in Galax. But this is the largest influx of treatment funding in state history.”

On environmental enforcement, Miyares points to an $80 million settlement with Monsanto over PCB pollution and multiple other actions, including prosecuting illegal landfills and forcing remediation of oil spills and raw sewage discharges. “Our environmental law section has been incredibly active,” he said. “We’re thorough, we’re relentless, and we’re the people’s protector.”

That populist posture extends to corporations. Miyares boasts of taking on utility giants and the Washington Commanders alike. “We got a bigger settlement from the Commanders than D.C. and Maryland combined,” he said, referring to the $1.3 million paid over unlawfully withheld ticket deposits.

And in 2023, his office negotiated changes to Dominion Energy’s offshore wind plan. “We got them to share $3 billion of the risk, instead of placing it all on the ratepayers,” he said. “Before us, Virginians were on the hook for 100% of that cost.”

But his critics say his record on housing and regulation is mixed. Miyares counters that protecting property rights doesn’t preclude enforcing civil rights.

“I don’t think those are mutually exclusive,” he said. “We secured the largest housing discrimination verdict in Virginia’s history — $750,000 to two families evicted because one member was Black. And we’re making sure bad actors are held accountable, without choking off affordable housing through overregulation.”

Elections, energy and political calculations

Early into his tenure, Miyares established an Election Integrity Unit, which he said ensures voter rolls are accurate. Launched in September 2022 with no new funding, the unit is tasked with investigating election-law violations and safeguarding voting integrity. It successfully issued a cease‑and‑desist against misleading mailers sent by Look Ahead America — an action upheld by a federal appeals court.

While Miyares touts the unit as crucial to preventing fraud, no actual voter fraud has been identified, leading watchdogs like the NAACP to criticize the unit as more reflective of political signaling than prosecutorial gain.

“I can cite several Virginia elections decided by a handful of votes. It should be easy to vote, hard to cheat,” he said, rejecting the notion that voter ID laws are a means of suppression. “I cannot get a library card without an ID. Voter ID is not controversial.”

In the interview, Miyares wouldn’t commit to refraining from prosecuting voters accidentally registered in error, noting that knowingly voting as a non-citizen could still result in legal action. “They’d have to fear prosecution if they go knowing they’re a non-citizen,” he said.

Miyares, along with Youngkin, has repeatedly challenged Virginia’s ties to California’s environmental standards, particularly on electric vehicles.

“Tying ourselves to California is a fool’s errand,” he said. “Their regulations are being dictated by an unelected air board. The average EV costs $68,000. That’s a tax on working-class Virginians.”

He said Virginia needs to expand its baseload energy capacity, not rely on intermittent sources like wind and solar. “I want electric bills to go down. Tying ourselves to California ensures they go up.”

Despite this skepticism, Miyares defended his record on climate enforcement, including recent court victories over solar and wind energy permits. “We are enforcing the law — just not surrendering to mandates that hurt working people.”

Miyares has also made “second chances” a talking point, holding job fairs for formerly incarcerated Virginians. But he remains skeptical of broader criminal justice reforms, including eliminating mandatory minimums.

“They’re an effective tool,” he said. “They help us go after repeat violent offenders and keep them off the streets.”

He argued that justice reform must be victim-centered.

“Too many of these conversations leave out the victims entirely. They’ve been through trauma, they’ve testified under oath in a courtroom full of strangers, and they deserve to know the system protects them.”

When asked if he supports GOP lieutenant governor nominee John Reid, whose campaign was embroiled in scandal earlier this spring, Miyares replied simply, “I support Republicans.” Despite Youngkin’s attempts to nudge Reid from the race, Miyares said he respects the governor’s judgment — but “John Reid is our nominee.”

Looking to the 2025 election, Miyares said he’s proudest of the state’s drop in fentanyl death — 46%, more than double the national average. “There are Virginians alive today because of our work,” he said.

If reelected, he said, he’d expand Operation Ceasefire and continue pressing commonwealth’s attorneys to prioritize victims.

“I have said before, I will not support a criminal first, victim last mindset. And I find it amazing that whenever we have these great discussions about criminal justice reform, the one word that you never hear is victims,” Miyares said.

“Denying the voice of victims is not something I’ll ever find acceptable.”

With six candidates on the ballot, the June 17 Democratic contest for lieutenant governor is the second most-crowded statewide primary in modern Virginia history.

If history is any guide, a congested primary can generate uncertainty and makes it possible that someone can claim the nomination with considerably less than a majority of votes cast.

Here’s a quick review of five statewide primaries since 1997 where the nominee won less than 40%. The races are listed in chronological order.

1997 Attorney General (Republican primary)

Political newcomer Gil Davis made a splash by representing a former Arkansas state employee who filed a sexual harassment claim against then-President Bill Clinton. A week before the primary, state Sen. Ken Stolle released a TV ad attacking Davis, who was shown, drink in hand, talking to a client about her desire to pose naked in Playboy magazine. As it turned out, Stolle should have saved his fire for his Senate colleague, Mark Earley of Chesapeake. The party’s ascendent anti-abortion base carried Earley to victory in a four-way race. Davis finished last.

Mark Earley 35.8%

Jerry Kilgore 24.6%

Ken Stolle 20.8%

Gilbert Davis 18.8%

In the 1997 general election, Republicans rode gubernatorial candidate Jim Gilmore’s “No Car Tax!” slogan to their first-ever trifecta of statewide offices. In the attorney general race, Earley captured 57.5% of the vote to defeat Democrat Bill Dolan.

With a quiet second place finish in the GOP primary, Jerry Kilgore of Scott County in far Southwest Virginia put himself in line to become the party’s consensus attorney general choice in 2001. Gil Davis never ran for office again, but one of his law associates, Bill Stanley, won a special election to the state Senate in January 2011.

2001 Lieutenant Governor (Democrat primary)

In the second year after the millennium, the candidates with the best name ID were two members of the House of Delegates. Alan Diamonstein, at 69, was part of the party’s old guard that had just lost its majority in the House of Delegates. Jerrauld Jones was a skilled lawmaker who headed the Legislative Black Caucus. Richmond Mayor Tim Kaine, with his yard signs an unusual green and yellow, was only one year younger than Jones, but presented himself as a new generation of Democratic leadership. Kaine, the son-in-law of former Republican Gov. Linwood Holton, rang up big majorities in the Richmond area.

Tim Kaine 39.7%

Alan Diamonstein 31.4%

Jerrauld Jones 28.9%

In the general election, Kaine landed just north of a majority (50.3%) in a three-way race against little-known Republican legislator Jay Katzen (48.1%) and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Reams (1.6%). Many Democrats had expected Charlottesville state Sen. Emily Couric to be their nominee. But Couric — a rising star who was as telegenic as her sister, Katie, the Today Show host — withdrew in July 2020 after a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Emily Couric died three weeks before Election Day.

2001 Attorney General (Democratic primary)

It’s hard to imagine a statewide Democratic primary where the populous suburbs of Northern Virginia do not play the kingmaker. But that is essentially what happened in June 2001, when Democrats went to the polls to select nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general. Without a single candidate from Northern Virginia, turnout was driven by candidates from Richmond and Tidewater. In the lieutenant governor’s race, twice as many votes were cast in Henrico County (7,528) than in Loudoun and Prince William combined (3,012).

Downstate candidates — state Del. Whitt Clement of Danville and state Sen. John Edwards of Roanoke — put up dazzling favorite-son margins in their respective home bases, but the turnout worked to the advantage of Donald McEachin, a state legislator from Henrico who won majorities in core urban cities like Richmond, Hampton and Newport News.

Donald McEachin 33.6%

John Edwards 29.5%

Whitt Clement 26.9%

Sylvia Clute 10.0%

Source: Virginia Department of Elections Database

In the general election, McEachin lost his bid to become the first Black attorney general in Virginia history. McEachin’s social justice agenda was ignored by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner, who ran a centrist campaign with crossover appeal to gun-loving, NASCAR-crazy rural Virginia. McEachin managed only 39.9% of the vote, falling below Mary Sue Terry’s previous record for the all-time worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide general election.

2005 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

From the standpoint of geography and ideology, the four candidates who sought the lieutenant governor nomination in 2005 seemed handpicked to splinter the state’s Democratic coalition. Leslie Byrne and Chap Petersen were from Northern Virginia, Viola Baskerville was from Richmond and Philip Puckett was from Southwest Virginia.

They ran the gamut from unabashed liberal (Byrne), diligent policy wonk (Baskerville), contrarian (Petersen) and conservative (Puckett). None were slouches; all were legislators who could point to achievements. In the end, party loyalists opted for Byrne, a familiar name who had served in both chambers of the state legislature and one term in the U.S. House, making her the first woman from Virginia to serve in Congress.

Leslie Byrne 32.9%

Viola Baskerville 26.1%

Chap Petersen 21.7%

Philip Puckett 19.4%

Source: Virginia Department of Elections Database

In the general election, Republicans nominated state Sen. Bill Bolling of Hanover County and figured they would make quick work of Byrne, arguably the most left-leaning statewide Democrat nominated since populist Henry Howell in the 1970s. Even though Bolling held a 2-to-1 ratio fundraising advantage, Byrne made it a close race. The final tally was Bolling 50.1%, Byrne 49.3%.

2021 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

This wide-open race with eight candidates — a record number for a statewide primary — narrowed in late April when then-Gov. Ralph Northam endorsed Hala Ayala. She was a little-known state legislator from Prince William County who had been swept into the House of Delegates as part of a massive anti-Trump backlash in 2017. Her story of financial struggle as a woman of color who lacked health care when her first child was born resonated with party faithful still celebrating Medicaid expansion in Virginia. Her multiethnic lineage (a father with Northern African roots who emigrated from El Salvador and a mother who was Irish and Lebanese) offered something for an increasingly diverse Virginia electorate.

Hala Ayala 37.6%

Sam Rasoul 24.3%

Mark Levine 11.2%

Andria McClellan 10.6%

Sean Perryman 8.1%

Xavier Warren 4.1%

Elizabeth Guzman* 4.1%

*Withdrew from race, but her name appeared on the ballot

The general election was a historic one in which Virginia would elect its first female lieutenant governor – and the first woman of color. The GOP nominated Winsome Sears, a native of Jamaica who emigrated as a child to the United States with her family. Sears won 50.7% of the vote as part of a GOP sweep of the three statewide offices. Also of note: Democratic Del. Mark Levine took the risky path of running in two primaries on the same day – one for lieutenant governor and the other to retain the party’s nomination for his legislative seat in Alexandria. He lost both.

Senate Democrats rejected several appointees to Virginia’s governing boards at various colleges on Monday, including former Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.

The Monday vote by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee removed all eight appointees made by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The move, which Democratic leaders attributed to differences in political values, now puts the decision to find replacements in the governor’s hands once again.

“The work and the oversight that we have and as chairman of this committee is to provide accountability and oversight to our prestigious institutions to ensure that those bodies align with our values and what we see in the political climate today, especially coming out of Washington, trying to make their way into our commonwealth,” said Senate Privileges and Elections Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. “It is our job to stand up and protect those values, and that is what we are doing today.”

In a statement after the meeting, Rouse referred to Cuccinelli and the other seven appointees as “MAGA extremists” and “Project 2025 supporters,” who are opposed to Democrats’ progressive ideals.

Cuccinelli’s “extreme” position on reproductive rights, his work Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate under Republican control — and his “hateful attacks” on LGBTQ Virginians prevented Rouse from lending his support to the governor’s appointment for Cuccinelli to serve on the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors, the Democratic senator said.

“He’s a Trump crony who is simply too extreme to have a role in shaping one of our commonwealth’s flagship universities,” Rouse, who is running for lieutenant governor and facing five Democratic contenders, said of Cuccinelli.

Merrick was slated to serve at George Mason University under the governor’s appointment.

The remaining seven nominees were to serve at Virginia Military Institute and George Mason, but they were all denied by the Democratic-controlled committee in an 8-4 vote. Three Senate Republicans were missing from the meeting.

In response to their colleagues’ action, Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, and Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, defended the governor’s appointees, highlighting that the group is made up of former public servants on the state and federal levels, military service members, and private sector leaders.

“There is nothing about any of these individuals that makes them unqualified to serve the commonwealth of Virginia in any of these positions,” Sturtevant said at Monday’s meeting. “These are all highly qualified appointees.”

DeSteph and Sturtevant also questioned why a joint subcommittee made up of members from both the Senate and House Privileges and Elections Committees had not met to review the statements and economic interests of the appointees, per state code. Rouse directed the question to the subcommittee’s attorney who said he was not aware of if the subcommittee is active.

“We have to follow the law and what the law says,” Sturtevant said, adding that any motion on the appointees moving forward would be “out of order,” “improper” and “not in compliance” with state law.

DeSteph, who was uncertain if the committee was properly formed, added that the state law says that there “shall” be a subcommittee.

“This isn’t a ‘may.’ This isn’t a ‘you can ignore this.’ This is a ‘shall,” DeSteph said. “Normally, when something is in code that strict we kind of do it. Otherwise this is Step A before Step B.”

Staff was unable to determine when the subcommittee last met or how many of the governor’s appointees have been confirmed. Rouse estimated hundreds.

Earlier this year, Democrats also blocked nine of Youngkin’s appointees, including two Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors nominees.

Leader sends letter to rectors

In a June 9 letter, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote to all the heads of Virginia’s public universities that state code requires all governing body members to be confirmed by the General Assembly, stating that they “will not confirm individuals who do not possess the judgment, character, or willingness to follow the principles” he outlined in the letter.

Some of those principles require board members to understand their fiduciary duties, to commit to the independent governance of such institutions, and to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.

“The General Assembly takes seriously its oversight responsibilities regarding Virginia’s public universities,” Surovell wrote. “Should any Board of Visitors fail to exercise appropriate independent judgment or allow external influences to compromise their fiduciary duties, the General Assembly will not hesitate to examine the situation and take whatever legislative action may be necessary.”

The letter went on to remind university heads that they are accountable to the General Assembly and that the boards must exercise independent judgment and are not obligated to the directives of the governor.

“Virginia is proud to maintain one of the strongest public higher education systems in America,” the letter states. “Our commonwealth is home to some of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious institutions, and they deserve governance that is independent, principled, and focused solely on their academic mission and service to the commonwealth.”

State legislators are now considering other university BOV nominees, a process that is slated to continue through the end of the year.

If Youngkin plans to appoint new members to fill expiring seats, he has until the end of his term in January.

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined a bipartisan group of attorneys general from across the country in urging Congress to pass the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act, a measure designed to shield homebuyers from aggressive and misleading marketing tactics tied to their mortgage credit data.

At the center of the issue is the use of “trigger leads,” a legal but controversial practice in which credit bureaus sell consumer data to third-party lenders and marketing firms the moment someone applies for a mortgage. These companies then flood prospective homebuyers with unsolicited phone calls, text messages, emails, and sometimes fraudulent offers—often before the borrower even hears back from their own lender.

“Too many hardworking Virginia families have been harassed and misled by aggressive telemarketers the moment they begin the homebuying process,” said Miyares. “It’s time to stop turning the American dream of homeownership into a marketing free-for-all.”

While allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), these practices have triggered growing concern nationwide. State attorneys general say they have long attempted to protect consumers from the abuse of trigger leads, only to be blocked by federal preemption clauses in the FCRA. Now, with bipartisan support and a renewed push in Congress, officials are calling for lasting change.

The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act would limit the sale of trigger leads only to companies that already have a relationship with the consumer or that have received explicit consent to access the data. Supporters say the bill strikes a balance—protecting consumer privacy without shutting down healthy competition among lenders.

In 2023, a similar version of the bill passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous support, indicating strong bipartisan backing for the measure. The current version continues to gain traction, with support from both lawmakers and industry leaders who want to end deceptive marketing and restore trust in the mortgage process.

For many home buyers, especially first-time buyers, the barrage of unexpected offers can be overwhelming and confusing. In some cases, misleading solicitations have caused borrowers to mistakenly abandon secure, affordable mortgage offers in favor of more costly options. Others have become targets of scams.

By curbing the misuse of consumer data and restoring clear privacy boundaries, the bill would help protect the personal information of millions of Americans during one of the most important financial decisions of their lives.

Virginia joins a broad coalition of support that includes 49 states and territories, including Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C., all pressing Congress to act swiftly.

“Congress has an opportunity to protect the personal information of millions of Americans by passing this commonsense, bipartisan-backed bill,” said Miyares.

Driving the news

Tesla received licensing to deploy EV charging stations, solar panels, battery storage systems, and sell electricity directly to consumers.

The big picture

Morocco is already a global leader in renewables, generating 38% of electricity from clean sources in 2024, with a goal of 52% by 2030. Projects like the Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex showcase the country’s solar ambitions.

Tesla’s presence could:

Accelerate solar-powered EV charging infrastructure

Boost local battery storage solutions

Support the decentralization of Morocco’s national grid

Talent pipeline

Morocco produces 10,000+ engineering graduates annually. Institutions like Mohammed VI Polytechnic University are grooming talent in clean energy and smart grid systems—key for Tesla’s workforce needs.

“Tesla can play a catalytic role in job creation and tech transfer,” said an official familiar with Morocco’s industrial policy.

Between the lines:

Youth unemployment (ages 15–24) stood at 17% in 2024. Tesla’s arrival could align with state efforts to create high-tech jobs.

The government’s National Electric Mobility Strategy targets 10,000 public EV chargers by 2030 and 20% EV share of new vehicle sales.

Zoom out

Tesla’s expansion to Morocco offers a springboard into both European and sub-Saharan markets. With EU trade ties and a strategic geographic location, Morocco could serve as Tesla’s logistics and manufacturing base for North Africa.

Reality check:

Affordability gap: With average urban salaries around $350/month, Tesla cars priced at $40,000+ are out of reach for most Moroccans.

Grid transition lag: As of 2024, 45% of Morocco’s electricity still came from coal and gas, per ONEE.

Incentives and local manufacturing may be key to lowering EV costs and boosting adoption.

What’s next

Trump's Bill Would End EV Subsidies: Could That Bankrupt Lucid Group?","Key Points

Lucid Group has limited capital and is burning through its cash rapidly.

Eliminating EV tax credits could affect Lucid's competitiveness.

10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›

Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) is growing its electric vehicle (EV) sales rapidly right now. In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.

The American Midwest is home to some of the richest, most productive farmland in the world, enabling its transformation into a vast corn- and soy-producing machine—a conversion spurred largely by decades-long policies that support the production of biofuels.

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of US biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that US biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage, and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—has long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy-efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the US Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is, by far, the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, but it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest, and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 14:07:35.613483

They've spotlighted that the potential rolling back of federal tax credits, birthed from the Inflation Reduction Act, might put Arizona's recent economic gains at risk. These incentives have been pivotal in the state's success in attracting business investments and creating jobs within the renewable energy sector.

Stressing the importance of bipartisan effort, Kelly emphasized that Arizona's status as a business hub is due to a collaborative approach over the years. According to a press release by his office, Kelly said, ""Because of this we've benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits."" He pointed out that the Republican plan to snip these programs could potentially increase energy prices and lead to thousands of job losses. Senator Gallego also echoed the urgency, stating in the same press release, ""This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families.""

The implications of repealing these tax credits are considerable, with projections hinting at an 11.4% hike in annual electricity bills for households by 2029, as mentioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association. Rep. Ansari, in a statement disseminated by her office, branded the Trump administration's strategy as chaos, insisting that further cuts would jeopardize Arizona's economy and represent ""bad policy.""

On the business front, the stance is clear: keeping these tax credits intact is crucial. Danny Seiden, President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry, highlighted the importance of targeted tax credits in sustaining Arizona's manufacturing momentum. Furthermore, Richard Ra, President of LG Energy Solution Arizona, told Senator Kelly's office, ""We are investing billions of dollars in Queen Creek and look forward to creating high quality jobs in Arizona as we bring our advanced manufacturing expertise and experience to the United States.""

Meanwhile, Governor Hobbs is backing strategies that seem to advance the Arizona Promise by creating opportunities for the working class and fostering economic growth. Her office released figures showing Arizona's economy has attracted 134 projects, representing more than 69,000 jobs and $58 billion in investments, all of which stand to be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. Added to these voices, Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority, noted the jeopardy faced by projects in their pipeline should these financial programs be phased out or eliminated.

Maren Mahoney, Director of the Arizona Governor’s Office of Resiliency, insisted, ""Without these federal investments in clean energy technology, Arizona families stand to lose out on good-paying jobs in manufacturing and construction, and risk even higher energy bills.""

The Set 2 Rule proposes the biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel (BBD), advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has unveiled a significant proposal aimed at enhancing American energy security and supporting domestic agriculture. The agency is proposing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume targets for 2026 and 2027, marking a pivotal step forward for the program, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.

Under the leadership of President Trump, the EPA’s “Set 2” proposal seeks to uphold the original intent of the RFS program, expanding the use of American-made biofuels, bolstering domestic energy production, and aiding rural economies.

“This new approach supports U.S. farmers while helping to stabilize fuel prices and preserve the role of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We must stop relying on foreign competitors at the expense of American consumers and producers.”

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins emphasized the impact on agricultural producers, stating, “President Trump understands the vital role the RFS plays for corn and soybean growers. Administrator Zeldin’s proposal is the most ambitious to date, providing much-needed market certainty for producers and reducing costs for consumers at the pump. The USDA and EPA are now more aligned than ever in promoting American-grown biofuels.”

Rollins also highlighted recent trade successes, including a deal with the U.K. that secured tariff-free access for over $700 million in ethanol exports. “This is part of our strategy to expand American energy leadership globally,” she said.

If finalized, the proposed rule would set the highest Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) in the program’s history, reinforcing the Trump Administration’s commitment to energy independence and rural development.

Key elements of the proposal include:

Ambitious growth targets for core renewable fuels.

A revised valuation system that favors domestically produced biofuels and feedstocks over foreign imports.

The elimination of electricity (eRIN) as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS, aligning with the President’s goal to roll back electric vehicle mandates.

Traditionally, the RFS operated as a single-variable system, adjusting only fuel volumes. The new proposal introduces a second factor—adjusting the value of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) based on the fuel’s origin. Under this system, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would receive only half the RIN value compared to domestic equivalents.

The proposed rule is expected to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil by about 150,000 barrels per day during 2026 and 2027. In 2024, nearly 45 percent of biomass-based diesel (BBD) feedstocks and fuels were imported. By reducing the RIN value for these imports, the EPA aims to stimulate domestic production and further enhance national energy security.

The Set 2 Rule proposes the biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel (BBD), advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027. The volume targets are as follows:

Table 1: Volume Requirements 2023 – 2027 (billion RINs)a

One RIN is equivalent to one ethanol-equivalent gallon of renewable fuel.

This proposal is a central piece of President Trump’s broader strategy to reinforce American energy independence, expand agricultural markets, and push back against unfair international trade practices. Finalizing these requirements would secure investments made by U.S. farmers, processors, and fuel producers—industries critical to the nation’s energy stability and the vitality of rural communities.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ethanol-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 18:07:23.507267

With electricity bills soaring, New Jersey lawmakers are exploring alternative renewable energy sources — including the untapped potential of ocean wave and tidal power — as part of a broader strategy to reduce costs and meet clean energy goals.

On June 12, the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee advanced A-1478, a bill directing the state Board of Public Utilities to study the viability of ocean-based energy. Supporters say New Jersey’s extensive shoreline positions it to be a national leader in marine renewable technology.

Custom-designed buoys, converters and other equipment could be used to harness energy from tides and waves for consumer use.

“Due to our vast shoreline and offshore resources, New Jersey could be a pioneer in exploring and evaluating wave energy from economic as well as environmental perspectives on the Northeast coast,” said Jasmine Mettelus of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

Mettelus said ocean-based energy could complement more established renewables like solar and wind. The state has committed to 100% clean energy by 2035, but progress has been slowed by the rollback of federal environmental policies under former President Donald Trump.

Electricity prices in New Jersey jumped as of June 1, driven by a regional transmission auction that set new rates. According to state regulators, the average household can expect to pay about $20 more per month. PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, cites increased demand from artificial intelligence data centers and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing as contributing factors.

Some Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism about the feasibility of ocean energy.

“In theory, this sounds like it could be good, but some of the parallels to offshore wind are concerning to me,” said Assemblyman Paul Kanitra, a Republican from Point Pleasant Beach. “How much is this going to industrialize the ocean? How is it going to affect our marine and fishing industries?”

Assemblyman Christian Barranco, a Republican from Pompton Lakes, voted against the bill and called for a focus on immediate solutions.

“This is not going to help us in any way with the freight train that we’re facing of electrical costs in New Jersey,” Barranco said. “Everything that takes away from the fact that we need generating assets, turbines spinning right now, is getting in the way of what we need to do to make sure we don’t go broke paying our electric bills.”

The same day, the Senate Environment and Energy Committee advanced S-4530, which would significantly expand New Jersey’s community solar program. The bill proposes opening registration for up to 3,000 megawatts of additional capacity — enough to power more than 500,000 homes.

Community solar projects allow neighborhoods to benefit from shared solar installations, offering access to residents who rent or live in multi-unit buildings without rooftop space.

“Solar is critical because it allows for a just transition and equal access to clean energy, including … New Jerseyans who may rent their homes and not have access to their own roofs,” said Jesse Sutherland of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

Not everyone is on board with the scale of the proposed solar expansion. Maura Caroselli, managing attorney for gas and clean energy at the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, warned about potential costs to ratepayers.

“While we appreciate the goals of this bill, we are concerned that it is too much, too fast,” Caroselli said. “We need to make sure there is sufficient generation to meet this goal, and that the subsidies to be paid by ratepayers are not over-burdensome.”

Ben Dziobek, founder of the Climate Revolution Action Network, supported the bill, citing the urgent need for energy alternatives.

“We are in an extreme time of energy need, with expanding usage from AI and other industries,” Dziobek said. “Right now we also have lost the majority of our wind industry in New Jersey. We’re going to need to find ways to get that energy from somewhere else.”",https://mercerme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/electric_costs_increase.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 14:07:22.270134

CLASSIFYING FENTANYL: The House has passed the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (S. 331), sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to register fentanyl-related substances as schedule I controlled substances, with no medical value, a high danger of being abused, and accordingly strict legal penalties. A bill supporter, Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the permanent schedule I classification “will strengthen law enforcement’s ability to prosecute fentanyl traffickers and act as a deterrent.” An opponent, Rep.

Murphy said the drone sale appeared to be tied to Qatar’s gift of a luxury airplane that amounted to a personal present to President Trump, and “if we start to endorse and grease the wheels of this kind of corruption, then there will be no end” to such corruption. A bill opponent, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, said it sought to turn a security partnership with Qatar into a partisan political issue.

REGULATING CRYPTOCURRENCY STABLECOINS: The Senate has passed a substitute amendment sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (S. 1582). The bill would establish procedures for federal regulation of stablecoins, which are digital cryptocurrencies intended to have a relatively static value by tying them to another asset, such as gold or the dollar. Thune called it a needed resolution of a situation in which “stablecoin issuers are operating in a legal gray zone. Companies that want to follow the rules can’t be sure what rules to follow.” A bill opponent, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said it “exposes taxpayers, consumers, and the financial system to unacceptable risk and creates venues for criminals, terrorists, and rogue governments to finance their illicit activities.” The vote, on June 12, was 67 yeas to 30 nays.

Report examines how this dominance shapes global electric vehicle (EV) markets, creating strategic challenges for the free world, specifically the United States and India.

While examining the EV dynamics of US, the report analyses Leftist Biden-Harris Autopen Administration’s promotion measures for “other-than-Tesla” EVs, EV tax credit and Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” and other actions against EVs.

This report examines Indian developments around EVs. Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, infamous for a “secret” MoU with the CCP, has repeatedly and openly promoted EVs. The report takes note of India’s EV producers (Tata, Mahindra, and others) and India’s efforts to counter CCP-occupied China’s mineral dominance.

CCP-Occupied China’s Control Over Critical Minerals

CCP-occupied China dominates EV supply chains:

Lithium: Mines 17% of global lithium, refines ~65-70%. Australia (43%) and Chile (25%) lead mining, but CCP firms like Ganfeng Lithium control refining.

Cobalt: Congo produces ~70% of cobalt, with Chinese Communist Party firms (e.g. CMOC) controlling ~60%. CCP-occupied China refines ~80% of battery-grade cobalt.

EVs require ~200 kg of critical minerals against ~35 kg required for ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles, amplifying vulnerabilities.

REEs: Mines ~60-69% of REEs, processes ~90-92%, including 99.9% of heavy REEs (e.g., dysprosium) in 2024 due to a Vietnamese facility outage.

As part of its unfair trade practices and trade war, CCP-occupied China has imposed export restrictions (e.g. April 2025 ban on seven heavy REEs and magnets).

Impact on Global EV Markets

Despite EVs being heavier by 30 % by weight, impacting fuel efficiency and road infrastructure, thanks to climate propaganda, Global EV sales hit 17 million in 2024 (CCP-occupied China: 11.3 million, Europe: 3.2 million, U.S.: 1.5 million).

CCP-occupied China’s dominance creates risks:

Supply Disruptions: REE magnet bans imposed by CCP-occupied China threaten EV motor production (~520g REEs per vehicle) in other countries, thereby thwarting diversification and competition.

Cost Pressures: Indian firms like Tata face delays due to end-user certificate requirements and other intentional delays by CCP-occupied China firms, risking halts by June 2025.

Geopolitical Leverage: CCP-occupied China’s 65% lithium and 80% cobalt refining share creates bottlenecks. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 500% demand rise by 2050.

Global EV markets are facing uncertainties due to technical, servicing-related and geopolitical factors.

The US and India, the Big Two, are in retaliation mode in response to unfair trade practices and the trade war of CCP-occupied China.

U.S. Retaliation, Political Dynamics and Elon Musk’s Tesla - the American EV producer

To comprehend the domestic, at times CCP-backed, political dynamics around EVs in a big democracy like US; the background of EV policies and politics across last few years may be viewed first.

The U.S. federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, incentivises new electric vehicle purchases or leases to reduce emissions and support domestic manufacturing. Introduced in 2008 under President Barack Hussein Obama, it was expanded via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) under President Joe Biden.

This tax credit applies to SUVs/trucks under $80,000 and sedans under $55,000, assembled in North America, with battery materials meeting sourcing rules (e.g. excluding CCP-occupied China). Eligible Buyers must earn ≤$150,000 (individuals) or ≤$300,000 (couples). The incentives also cover $4,000 credit for used EVs (≤$25,000) and a 30% credit (up to $7,500) for commercial EVs.

In 2024, ~3.4 million households claimed over $8 billion in these credits, reducing prices for models like the Tesla Model Y ($7,500 cheaper) and Ford F-150 Lightning (from $62,995 to $55,495).

This incentive supposedly boosts EV adoption, supports U.S. EV automakers. Critics say this favours high-income buyers and firms like Tesla ($2.7 billion in carbon credits).

Elon Musk opposed EV subsidies in 2021, claiming Tesla succeeded without them, though Tesla benefited a lot from them. After Biden’s 2021 EV summit excluded Tesla, Musk aligned with nationalists led by Trump in 2024, criticising leftist Democrats.

Elon Musk’s Republican alignment and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) role polarised Democrats. The Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report poll 2025 showed Democrat support for EV mandates fell to 78% from 85% in 2023, citing Musk’s Trump ties and Tesla’s $2.7 billion carbon credits as elitist.

In 2025, Musk favoured the continuation of incentives as Tesla’s sales dipped (1.8 million vehicles, down 1% from 2023). Elon Musk also claims credit repeal would hurt GM and Ford more, but Tesla, too, could lose 100,000 U.S. sales annually. Some environmental activists see Musk as a climate ally but distrust his ties with CCP-occupied China (Shanghai Gigafactory).

Tesla’s Supply Chain: Tesla likely relies on CCP-occupied China’s minerals.

Lithium: Sourced from Australia and the U.S., but CCP’s ~65% refining share implies indirect, if not direct, dependence.

Cobalt: Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery (LFP) LFP batteries (Model 3/Y) avoid cobalt; NMC batteries use CCP-occupied China refined cobalt (~80% of supply).

REEs: Model Y motors use ~520g of REEs. CCP-occupied China’s 90% processing dominance suggests reliance, somehow via CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited), a CCP-occupied China company in Shanghai.

Reportedly, Tesla mitigates this dependence on CCP-occupied China companies by using LFP batteries, REE-free motors (announced 2023, impacting CCP-occupied China companies’ stocks by 5.9-10%), and North American sourcing.

Democrats’ Perspective: Democrats view EVs as vital for climate goals (Biden’s 50% EV sales target by 2030). Democrats frame EV credits as job creators. But their excluding of Musk from policy discussions alienated Tesla.

Trump’s Actions Against EVs

Trump’s anti-EV stance, based on climate scepticism and self-reliance, includes serial actions:

Trump Campaign (2024): Pledged to “cancel the EV mandate” (officially tactfully projected as emission targets by the Biden Administration) and repeal the $7,500 credit, claiming EVs would kill 40% of auto jobs. Promised increased oil production (“drill, baby, drill”).

Transition Planning (November 2024): Trump’s team proposed for repeal of the EV tax credit to compensate for proposed tax cuts, offsetting $921 billion.

Executive Orders (January 2025): Unleashing American Energy, the Presidential orders halted funding worth $7.5 billion in EV charging infrastructure (NEVI/CFI programs). The orders rescinded Biden’s 50% EV sales goal by 2030 and signalled relaxing EPA tailpipe emissions rules.

Legislative Support (Feb-May 2025): Backed Sen. John Barrasso’s S. 541 (Eliminating Lavish Incentives to Electric Vehicles Act), repealing the $7,500 credit, $4,000 used EV credit, and charging incentives, effective 30 days post-passage. Supported Sen. Deb Fischer’s bill for a $1,000 one-time EV purchase fee, citing road damage from EV weight, as previously stated, EVs are far more heavier compared to equivalent petrol vehicles.

Big Beautiful Bill (May 2025): Trump secured near-unanimous Republican support for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (1,116-page Republican tax and budget proposal) passed by the House, curtailing EV incentives. The bill eliminates the $7,500 new EV tax credit, the $4,000 used EV tax credit, and charging station credits effective December 31, 2025 (originally expiring in 2032).

The bill imposes new fees - a $250 annual EV owner fee and $100 for hybrids to offset gas tax losses, managed by the Federal Highway Administration. The bill extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), offering a $10,000 deduction for interest on U.S.-assembled vehicle loans (≤$100,000 income) but excludes EVs from this. The Senate is reviewing the bill. The bill aims to reduce reliance on CCP-occupied China’s minerals and rare earths.

California Emissions Waiver (May 2025): Supported Senate Republicans blocking California’s 2035 fossil fuel car phase-out, affecting 12 states and 30% of the U.S. market.

Tariffs (April, May, June 2025): Imposed 25% import tariffs on cars, parts, and semiconductors.

Distancing from Musk: In June 2025, Trump criticised Musk, accusing him of flip-flopping on EV credits: “Elon knew the bill’s inner workings… now he has a problem.”

President Trump unplugged California’s EV mandates by signing three Congressional Review Act resolutions into law in second week of June 2025.

These serial actions are likely to cut U.S. EV sales by 40% by 2030 and aim to protect 1.5 million auto jobs and reduce mineral reliance on CCP-occupied China. Trump’s actions protect immediate U.S. interests. Diversifying supply chains is a more strategic long-term objective that which Trump Administration is yet to spell out.

India’s Retaliation, Domestic EV Players and Political Dynamics

India is also a big democracy and deals with adversarial half front within similarly to the US.

India’s 100% import dependence for lithium and cobalt (82% lithium, 60% graphite from CCP-occupied China) and REE magnet bans pose risks for which it has promulgated mitigation plans.

National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM): Launched in 2025 with Rs. 34,300 crore; it targets exploration (e.g. 5.9 million tonnes of lithium in Jammu & Kashmir), recycling, and acquisitions via KABIL (Khanij Bidesh India Ltd, a joint venture company promoted by reputed Indian mining companies) of lithium blocks in Argentina and Australia as well as copper blocks in Zambia.

Allied Partnerships: Joined the U.S.-led Mineral Security Partnership (2023), exploring REEs from Kazakhstan, Vietnam and Australia’s Lynas. A $1 billion Australian deal for lithium and cobalt is underway.

Refining Capacity: Public Sector company IREL’s Vizag plant produces 3,000 kg of samarium-cobalt magnets (aerospace-focused). A 20,000-tonne REE plant in Odisha by 2028 challenges CCP-occupied China’s 200,000-tonne capacity.

Policy: The 2024 EV policy cuts import tariffs to 15% for $500 million local investments, attracting Tesla but challenging domestic firms. Rs. 1,000 crore provision in public spending supports charging infrastructure for 100,000 EVs by 2030.

Innovation: Funds cobalt-free LFP batteries and REE substitutes, with IIT Mumbai developing tetrataenite magnets.

India’s indigenisation efforts align with its broader goal of reducing reliance on CCP-occupied China.

Indian EV Producers

India’s EV sales reached 100,000 units in 2024 (2.5% of 4.3 million car sales), targeting 30% by 2030.

Tata Motors: Leads with Nexon EV and Tigor EV, investing $1 billion. Opposes tariff cuts to protect its 60% market share.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Offers eVerito and XUV400 EV, with $500 million invested.

Maruti Suzuki: Launched e-Vitara in 2025, scaling up.

MG Motor India: A China-India joint venture company (SAIC-JSW), sells ZS EV.

VinFast: Vietnam’s entrant showcased EVs in 2025.

Telsa’s India investments ($2-3 billion) include Mumbai and Delhi showrooms, and also possibly a manufacturing facility in India for its selected cars.

CCP-occupied China's REE magnet bans and other unfair trade practices threaten indigenous and “Make in India for the World” production (~550g REEs per EV vs. 140g for ICE Vehicle). Domestic firms seek tariff protection against CCP-occupied China's EVs until 2029.

India is dealing with the CCP-occupied China threats by short term measures and long term plans for own production as stated above.

Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi’s EV Advocacy

Rahul Gandhi’s propaganda of EVs is notable. In interactions with Naga students and in an important parliamentary speech as leader of opposition, he raised concerns that were in alignment with CCP-occupied China’s interests.

Naga Students Interaction (February 2025): In a discussion with Naga students, Rahul Gandhi “emphasised EVs as part of a mobility “revolution”, stating, “Future of mobility will change everything”. He “urged” educational reforms to prepare for EV-driven industries, framing it as “economic progress”. This aligns with CCP-occupied China’s EV dominance, given India’s mineral import reliance.

Parliamentary Speech: Responding to the President’s Inaugural Address for the Budget 2025 session, Rahul Gandhi highlighted EVs, advocating for EV manufacturing to “create” jobs. He criticised Modi government’s “slow” progress on EV infrastructure. His focus on EVs without addressing supply chain risks fuels debate. His 2008 MoU with the CCP highlights transparency concerns, amplifying suspicions about his EV advocacy.

Strategic Considerations & Recommendations

Demoting CCP-occupied China linked EVs by US and India would impact CCP-occupied China’s 11.3 million EV sales and monopoly over supply chains.

Apropos, these recommendations are made.

U.S.: Expand MP Materials Corporation operations, fund LFP batteries, develop tetrataenite. Tariffs to protect domestic EVs producers.

India: Accelerate NCMM, secure KABIL assets, scale refining. Support Tata, Mahindra and other producers like Tesla if they focus on developing indigenous technology and supply chain diversification as well as resilience.

Global: Partner with Australia, Canada and Vietnam to diversify.

Conclusion

CCP-occupied China’s ~65-80% control over lithium, cobalt, and REE processing threatens EV markets. Trump’s anti-EV actions serve the immediate interests of the US. India’s robust efforts counter CCP-occupied China’s dominance. Rahul Gandhi’s EV advocacy in Nagaland and Parliament lacks a take on supply chain nuance. Diversifying supply chains and innovation can counter CCP-occupied China while also advancing alternative energy and more importantly self-reliance.",https://myind.net/sites/default/files/field/image/77ef6bf3_untitled.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 16:07:09.117941

Are electric minicars the future?: Smaller electric vehicles could be poised to fill the space between bikes and cars as people look for more space and energy efficient alternatives to driving a car or truck. 80% of trips in the United States are under ten miles so a 25 mph limited neighborhood electric vehicle could make sense for some of them. Could lower prices and new technology usher in a minicar future? (Michael J. Coren | Washington Post)

Emissions reductions from active transportation: Much of the literature and research about emissions reduction in transportation is from mode shift, not addressing the potential for changes in frequency and length of trips. New research suggests that mode shift alone only accounts for 1/5th of the potential for emissions reductions. Only changing modes reduced emissions 37% while allowing for changes in destinations and frequency reduced them 51%. (Guo, Bigazzi, Chen | Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment)

Gas stations getting bigger: With many gas stations set to build more charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, they are also getting bigger to accommodate people waiting for people to fill up their batteries. These mega stations, many over 7,000 square feet, had mostly been waystations on interstate highways. But now they are also moving into suburban and urban spaces, conflicting with local land uses and policies. (Kevin Williams | New York Times)

Give communities good design: Basic public sector design including logos and public websites is often maligned as boring and ineffective. That’s mostly because many design decisions are afterthoughts. But good design need not be ignored by public officials and should be more than just aesthetics and “style” argues John Pobojewski.

Expanding the street traffic academy: Indiana non-profit health by Design is partnering with the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute to hold regional workshops to teach safe systems thinking on traffic safety to local planners, staff, and residents. Additionally, Health by Design will provide customized crash analysis and technical assistance to high risk areas on how to identify the solutions to these problems.

The event has prompted concern about rising autocracy in the US. It will also produce more than 2m kilograms of planet-heating pollution – equivalent to the amount created by producing of 67m plastic bags or by the energy used to power about 300 homes in one year, according to a review by the progressive thinktank Institute for Policy Studies and the Guardian.

The military parade is meant to celebrate the US army’s 250th anniversary on 14 June – which will also coincide with the president’s 79th birthday. It will feature 150 military vehicles including 60-ton tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and more than 50 helicopters and aircraft such as a Mustang fighter aircraft and a B-25 Mitchell bomber, which were both used widely during the second world war. These vehicles burn dozens or even hundreds of gallons of fuel per hour.

Institute for Policy studies quantified the emissions that will result from the use of those vehicles, using data from the International Energy Agency and publicly available information. The researchers calculated emissions from not only the parade route itself, but also the transport of the vehicles to the event and the upstream impact of producing fuel for the parade.

The large quantity of emissions this activity is estimated to produce is equivalent to those from flying 4,700 people from North Carolina – where the parade helicopters are based – to the nation’s capital in first class.

The calculation is probably an understatement as it does not include pollution from transporting thousands of people, horses and equipment to the parade, or other energy used for the event.

Hanna Homestead, research analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted the same kinds of vehicles deployed for the parade have also been used to transport napalm and other supplies to Vietnam, and are now being used by Israel in its siege on Gaza.

“So we’re spending money to glorify a gas-guzzling equipment used for war, genocide and planetary destruction,” she said, “at the same time as critical services for populations at home and around the world are being slashed.”

Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Anna Kelley, said the parade “will honor all of the military men and women who have bravely served our country, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom”.

The president reportedly sought to throw a similar tribute during his first term, inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, but was thwarted by the then secretary of defense, James Mattis. Trump’s parade this year has inspired “No Kings” protests across the country.

Lindsay Koshgarian, program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, said that the parade’s emissions were “egregious” and the event itself was a “wake-up call” about Trump’s priorities.

“This parade comes alongside proposals for a $1tn Pentagon budget, along with massive cuts to healthcare, food programs, and an ideological attack on climate programs both in the Pentagon and across government,” she said. “The more we spend on sending these fuel-guzzling tanks and helicopters around the world, the less we have to protect our people, communities and the planet.”

The Institute for Policy Studies’ National Priorities Project, which focuses on budget analysis and which Koshgarian directs, found that the $45m it will cost to hold the military parade would be enough to fund programs Trump has put on the chopping block, such as the two offices enforcing endangered species protection or the development of an HIV vaccine in South Africa.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec89c41a75199f1855a14ff7b934534e0e31ce6/535_0_5329_4264/master/5329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e848f8fc30bee37eeae5cfc97b35fe7c,N,,2025-06-14 14:08:12.635991

As retirees living on a fixed income in Carson City, we’ve had growing concern watching energy costs continue to rise across Nevada. But nearly two decades ago, we made a decision that has provided us with both financial stability and peace of mind: we installed solar panels on our home.

The very tax credits that made our solar journey possible — and that have helped thousands of families across the state — are now on the chopping block.

Installing solar has allowed us to save thousands. The federal tax credits make solar more accessible to Nevadans—allowing them to save 30% on the cost of the project. Families have only just gotten started using them, and now, Congress wants to pull the plug. If Congress rolls them back, the next generation of Nevada homeowners could be locked out of the solar savings.

We first installed solar in 2006 when NV Energy offered a 50% rebate, and our 36 panels covered nearly all our energy use — shielding us from rising rates. Over time, they lost efficiency, but the savings fully paid for a new roof and the upgraded system we’re now planning. Now, thanks to today’s 30% federal tax credit, we’re installing just 17 high-efficiency panels that will meet 100% of our needs for the next 25 years — something we couldn’t afford without that incentive. If that tax credit disappears, as the House has proposed, our ability to afford this upgrade—and the clean energy future it represents—would have vanished with it.

Across Nevada’s second congressional district, represented by Congressman Mark Amodei, federal renewable energy incentives have generated $11 billion in investment. Already, more than 41,000 Nevada families have benefited from over $151 million in tax credits to lower costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency home upgrades during 2023 alone. Despite these proven benefits to constituents, lawmakers have moved to eliminate the very credits that enable homeowners to invest in solar energy.

These aren’t partisan issues—they’re economic ones. Solar energy puts money back in the pockets of families like ours while strengthening local businesses and creating high-quality jobs with strong wages. Nevada now ranks first in the nation for solar jobs per capita, with over 8,500 people employed in the industry statewide.

As we watch NV Energy repeatedly request rate increases—attempting to pass more costs onto consumers in ways that frankly seem obscene to us—we’re grateful for the energy independence our solar provides. When utility prices go up, our fixed income doesn’t have to stretch further, and our solar panels keep producing.

The solar tax credits make a huge difference between who will or will not be able to install solar on their roof, as we’ve seen firsthand. These credits are named by where they are located in the tax code – this specific credit is 25D. Without these incentives, many Nevada families simply couldn’t afford the upfront investment, despite the long-term savings that come with going solar.

That’s why we’re concerned about efforts to roll back these successful federal renewable energy provisions. We are counting on Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen to support the solar tax credits and oppose any attempts to weaken investments that are already delivering for Nevadans across the political spectrum. We also urge Representative Amodei to support any Senate fix when it comes back to the House.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” from the House has already cast uncertainty over homeowners, contractors, and local clean energy businesses. However, the Senate now has the opportunity to rework the bill in ways that center everyday Americans’ economic well-being by preserving 25D.

Our message to fellow Nevadans is straightforward: solar saves money. Our message to our representatives in Washington is equally clear: support the tax incentives that make solar accessible to more families like ours.

When we installed our first panels nearly 20 years ago, solar was still considered experimental by many. Today, our state produces enough solar energy to power more than 1.3 million Nevada homes. Solar provides over 30% of our state’s electricity. This progress is worth protecting.

For retirees like us—and for working families feeling the pinch of rising costs—solar tax credits are delivering real benefits to real Nevadans every day. This is the success we should continue to build on.

Beyond merely laying out annual quotas, the agency’s blueprint advances changes meant to deter imports and spur more US biofuel production instead.
“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a release.
Those groups had also pushed for a higher overall biofuel-blending quota of 25 billion gallons in 2026.
The proposed target falls under that level the next two years, with the EPA proposing an overall 2027 quota of 24.46 billion gallons.","The Trump administration is proposing oil refiners blend more biofuels into gasoline and diesel next year, while seeking to discourage the use of imported supplies.

The plan unveiled by the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday would require refiners to mix a record 24.02 billion gallons of biofuels into conventional diesel and gasoline — nearly 8% higher than the 2025 target.

The proposal comes as President Donald Trump seeks to revamp aspects of the Renewable Fuel Standard program created by Congress two decades ago to bolster domestic demand and support rural communities. Beyond merely laying out annual quotas, the agency’s blueprint advances changes meant to deter imports and spur more US biofuel production instead.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a release. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

It’s the first major milestone for renewable fuel policy under Trump this year, helping shed light on how the president will approach an issue that proved especially controversial during his first term in office, when he struggled to balance demands from then oft-warring oil refiners and ethanol producers.

The proposed quotas boosted ethanol and soybean interests. Ethanol producer Green Plains Inc. jumped 20%, the most on a closing basis in five years, while Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. gained 4.7% and Bunge Global SA climbed 5.7%.

The proposal also lifted soybean oil futures in Chicago, which climbed as much as 6.2%. Renewable identification numbers, or RINs, tracking compliance with biomass-based diesel targets, gained 20% to $1.16, the biggest increase since last July. Credits tracking conventional ethanol climbed 18%.

The administration is so far dodging one of the thorniest issues — whether to grant some small refineries’ bids to be exempted from past years’ quotas and how to account for any waived volumes. The EPA said it was still determining how to address the matter but expected to make that clear before 2026 and 2027 quotas are finalized.

For biomass-based diesel typically made from soybeans and used cooking oil, the EPA is proposing a 2026 credit-based target it says would amount to 5.61 billion gallons, representing a 67% jump from the 3.35 billion gallons required this year. That’s broadly in line with what had been sought by a coalition of some large oil and biofuel interests, including the American Petroleum Institute and Clean Fuels Alliance America.

Those groups had also pushed for a higher overall biofuel-blending quota of 25 billion gallons in 2026. The proposed target falls under that level the next two years, with the EPA proposing an overall 2027 quota of 24.46 billion gallons.

The EPA plan was lauded by ethanol and biodiesel producers as well as lawmakers from soybean- and corn-heavy states, with Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, calling it a sign the “administration is committed to championing rural America.”

Integrated oil companies have increasingly linked arms with biofuel interests to champion the mandate, as more of them convert refineries to produce renewable diesel and generate the RINS used to show quotas have been fulfilled.

Yet the proposed quotas were decried by refiners that lack enough blending capacity to independently generate sufficient RINs and are uniquely exposed to higher credit costs. They had lobbied the agency for far more modest targets, warning aggressive quotas could outpace production, hiking the cost of compliance credits and putting domestic refining capacity in peril. The Fueling American Jobs Coalition that represents independent refiners and union workers called it “a gut punch.”

“These unrealistic mandates do not just threaten the future of independent refining; they endanger our existence today,” the group said by email. “EPA’s proposal would threaten many of America’s last remaining refineries, deepening our nation’s reliance on foreign fuel imports and sending consumer energy costs soaring. This stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s energy agenda.”

Discounted Credits

The EPA is proposing to halve the number of RINs awarded to biofuels that are imported or made in the US using foreign feedstocks, so each gallon generates half the credits awarded to domestic rivals. Roughly 45% of biomass-based diesel and its ingredients came from other countries last year.

The administration cast the proposed shift as promoting “national energy independence” and aiding American farmers, already on the front lines of Trump’s effort to rebalance trade flows with widespread tariffs. But it will come at the expense of biofuel producers with international footprints, potentially lowering the value of their foreign-made feedstocks.

The EPA also is proposing to lower the number of credits awarded to renewable diesel, jet fuel and co-products from 1.7 per gallon to 1.6, a shift meant to account for fossil-fuel based hydrogen found in most of the supplies. That compares with 1.5 for biodiesel, a similar yet chemically different product. The planned shift responds to criticism from biodiesel advocates who said some fuels have been unfairly discounted.

Companies would also be compelled to keep additional records on their purchases or transfers in a bid to thwart the use of fraudulent cooking oil and foreign supplies wrongly labeled as domestic.

The EPA is moving to set biomass-based diesel quotas as RINs, not on a per-gallon basis, and it is seeking to close an opening for electricity to count as a renewable fuel under the program. That would prevent generating credits from charging electric vehicles with power made from sources such as woody biomass.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order that says the deal can go through so long as the Japanese company complies with a “national security agreement.”

The order, posted on whitehouse.gov, did not provide terms of the agreement.

However, the companies said in a joint statement that the agreement establishes about $11 billion in new investments that will be made by 2028.

Investments include a greenfield project.

The agreement also reportedly includes an American CEO, an American-majority board and a “golden share.” which requires U.S. government approval of a number of the board members that allows the U.S. to ensure that production levels aren’t cut.

“We thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,” the joint statement read.

“This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.”

The companies have completed a U.S. Justice Department review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, according to the joint statement.

Clairton Mayor Rich Lattanzi, a retired U.S. Steel employee who spent decades at the Irvin Works, took a moment from being out with family Friday evening to share his thoughts.

“This has been a long, drawn-out process and I and some other mayors contributed to the ongoing process of meetings, support letters and media influence,” Lattanzi said. “Nippon, from day one, presented the best deal possible that provided a detailed plan to invest, honor good-paying jobs and provide environmental improvements.”

Lattanzi said he looks forward to seeing what impact the combined efforts of Nippon and U.S. Steel will have on the area.

“For towns like mine, Clairton and the Mon Valley, this will provide the tax base necessary to ensure that our town can survive and grow,” Lattanzi said. “More important, as a third generation steelworker this will provide good jobs and benefits for my kids, grandkids and their kids. This is a blessing and, actually, a bit of history.

“We were at a turning point for steelmaking,” Lattanzi said. “Trump came through and stuck his neck out, and this will be a time in history that cultivates the strength of steelmaking and helping America build its future. I am so proud to be a part of US Steel/Nippon and the mayor of the town with the largest coke plant in America.”

West Mifflin Mayor Chris Kelly said Friday he hosted countless meetings of local, state and federal officials as well as union leaders, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel upper management in his garage.

“It’s been an unbelievable roller coaster,” Kelly said. “We thought we had the deal locked up several times, then something would throw a roadblock in it.

“As mayors we had very little power, but we supported it through state and federal individuals and hosting a lot of events. … It is the single largest investment in commonwealth history.”

Kelly highlighted the professionalism and courteousness of Nippon leaders during those visits.

“They are absolutely wonderful people to host,” he said. “It’s just been very pleasurable, and I can see the commitment and the same concerns that U.S. Steel had about our communities. … You can imagine the size of the document when you’re talking about almost $15 billion. It is estimated that this transaction is going to save and create almost 100,000 jobs.”

Kelly said he was on the phone with union leaders earlier in the day.

“They’re ecstatic,” Kelly said. “They are busy notifying all their membership that this has been finalized. It’s a big sigh of relief.”

Trump hosted a rally May 30 at U.S. Steel Irvin Works. It was called a victory lap by some attendees for supporters of the company’s $14 billion partnership with Nippon.

How can I make public comments?","The public now has until June 18 at 5 p.m. to send the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency their comments on the draft renewal permit for plastics-to-oil company Alterra Energy. This extension follows a May 28 public hearing at the Akron-Summit County Public Library, where residents expressed their concerns and requested more time to provide their perspectives.

At the hearing, representatives from the Akron Regional Air Quality Management District (ARAQMD) and OEPA shared details about Alterra’s operations and the draft permit, which will allow work to continue while providing limits on the company’s emissions.

Here are some things to know.

What does Alterra do?

Alterra transforms post-consumer plastics into synthetic oil, which can be used to make new plastics or other products. At the East Akron site, located at 1200 E. Waterloo Road, the plastics are fed into an extruder and melted, then heated in a kiln with no oxygen. The material is then sent through a condenser, where it is cooled and the oil is produced.

The oil is stored in tanks, and any non-conductive material (which does not easily conduct electricity) is directed to a vapor combustor unit, where the material is burned using a flare. The facility is required to destroy a minimum of 98% by weight of the volatile organic compounds, the gases that are emitted through this process. Any remaining emissions from the vapor combustor unit are released into the atmosphere.

Why does Alterra need a permit?

Alterra’s first permit was issued in 2012 and was valid for 10 years; the company began operations in 2015. The initial permit was modified a few times, so the permit renewal was delayed, an EPA spokesperson told Signal Akron.

This renewed permit, if approved, will allow Alterra to continue its operations. It would also reduce the maximum amount of plastic the company can feed into its kiln each hour from 6,250 pounds to 5,000 pounds — this change was made because Alterra could not meet the maximum, the EPA spokesperson said.

Some of the concerns at the public hearing were the lack of independent monitoring of Alterra’s production, the plant’s proximity to residential areas and the health impacts of the pollutants released into the air.

The permit is intended to limit the amount of pollutants Alterra can emit and set standards for control measures, operational restrictions, monitoring and recordkeeping, reporting and testing.

What are the requirements for the permit?

Some of the key permit requirements include:

Emission limitations on carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, fugitive volatile organic compounds and particulates.

A leak detection and repair program to identify and address potential emissions.

Restrictions ensuring only end-of-life plastics (plastics that can no longer be used/ plastic waste) from materials recovery facilities, recycling facilities and industrial facilities are processed.

Requirements for monitoring and reporting the amount of plastic processed, the amount of feed materials produced and marketed and the purchaser of the feedstock.

Quarterly reports of the amount of plastic processed and the amount of oil produced and annual evaluations of permit compliance.

An emissions test must be conducted by May 22, 2026, for pollutants including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and particulate emissions.

Under the permit, the facility is allowed to emit up to 34.7 tons of volatile organic compounds, 35.2 tons of nitrogen oxides, 13.4 tons of carbon monoxide, 10 tons of sulfur dioxide and 10 tons of particulate matter.

What happens when there is a violation?

If any violation occurs, the ARAQMD will issue a notice of violation and allow Alterra to respond and take corrective action. The notice of violation is also the first step toward escalated enforcement, such as fines or permit suspension, depending on the violation.

The notice of violation letters are public and can be found through the OEPA’s online records system by searching the facility ID (1677011258) or permit number (P0133062).

How does the permit process work?

When the OEPA receives a permit application, it issues a public notice and reviews the application for completeness. Once the permit terms and conditions have been prepared, the OEPA reviews and issues the draft notice and gives public notice.

For cases of what are called significant public interest, like Alterra’s permit, the OEPA holds a public hearing.

After reviewing the public comments made in person and online, the ARAQMD will make a recommendation to the EPA to issue or deny the permit. The OEPA director will take final action on the permit.

How can I make public comments?

Comments may be submitted online or by mail to Laura Miracle, ARAQMD, Summit County Public Health, 1867 W. Market St., Akron, OH 44313.

While the 100-crore project for the second BIM campus has seen a slight delay, officials remain optimistic about completing it by Nov this year. Governor R N Ravi laid the foundation for the project in 2024. With environmental sustainability at the core, officials said steps are being taken to ensure green standards on the new campus. Director of BIM Asit K Barma said water conservation forms a crucial part of the 19-acre green campus. ""The institute will have vayu jal machines in the hostels. The machines, developed by IIT-M PhD scholars, harness atmospheric moisture to produce potable water. By 2030, we expect 50% of our drinking water needs to be met by these atmospheric water generators (AWG),"" he said. The institute, an autonomous business school established and affiliated to Bharathidasan University, will have a small artificial pond for rainwater harvesting and the beautification purpose. Landscaping is also done in such a way that trees would need less water. Besides, only electric vehicles, bicycles, and electric buggies will be allowed for intra-campus travel. ""We want to promote bicycle usage, but EVs will not be restricted. EV charging stations will be installed at the entrance and four other locations, where users can pay through e-wallets to charge their vehicles,"" he said. The new campus is coming up along the Trichy-Pudukkottai highway, which is emerging as a knowledge hub. ""However, taxi services are scarce in the area. So, we plan to have two taxis on the campus,"" Barma said. The institute also plans to set up solar power plants starting with 140kW unit on the administration block and two hostels for about 300 students. As part of its expansion plans, the institution aims to increase its intake from the current 120 to more than 200 students. Besides the five specialized courses that are being offered at the campus in Thuvakudi inside the Bhel complex, officials are considering launching new courses in areas such as executive education, faculty development, management development, and healthcare management. According to sources, if everything goes by plan, the transition of first-year students to the new campus will begin in Jan next year and full-fledged operations of the campus are expected by June. The campus at Thuvakudi may function as a heritage campus offering only major programmes. ""Retaining the existing campus also allows us to preserve the rich legacy of our association with Bhel,"" a source said.

“And once again, I’m highly in opposition to offshore drilling.” “Since 1989, the Town of Kill Devil Hills Board of Commissioners has stated its strong opposition to offshore drilling, seismic testing, and leasing,” according to a call-to-action email sent Wednesday.
“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” the town stated.
“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” according to Southern Shores council members.
“Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion,” Southern Shores councilors stated.","From SamWalkerOBXNews.com

Dare County, Kill Devil Hills, Nags Head and Southern Shores leaders have reaffirmed their opposition to the Trump administration’s plans to open leasing of offshore sites for oil and natural gas drilling as a comment period on the proposal comes to a close on Monday.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management published in the Federal Register on April 30 a request for comments on the preparation of the 11th National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

The publication initiated a 45-day public comment period and served as the initial step in the multi-year planning process, according to the Interior Department.

Among the 42 executive orders Trump signed on his first day in office in 2025 was an attempt to repeal Former President Joe Biden’s Jan. 6 order to protect most U.S. offshore waters from leasing for oil and gas.

The order applied to federal waters in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Alaska, and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, though it allowed oil and gas production to continue in the western and central Gulf.

There has been considerable bipartisan pushback from local, state and federal elected officials against attempts by the previous administrations to allow offshore drilling along the North Carolina coast.

In 2019, nearly all of the state’s coastal counties, with the exception of Brunswick, passed resolutions opposing East Coast offshore oil and gas leases and leaders from Outer Banks towns and Dare County also actively lobbied in Raleigh and Washington.

The Dare County Board of Commissioners unanimously adopted a resolution Monday opposing the inclusion of North Carolina’s coast in the federal government’s proposed 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

“But the threat…the risk to our community from an economic perspective and environmental health perspective, has not changed,” said Dare County Department of Health and Human Services Director Sheila Davies at the Board of Commissioners meeting on Monday.

Davies said she attended a meeting in recent weeks with other coastal and environmental group leaders that included Kill Devil Hills Mayor Ivy Ingram and Nags Head Mayor Ben Cahoon to discuss the renewed offshore drilling efforts.

“This is critical. Any oil spill off our coast would certainly play havoc with our economic engine, and that’s tourism and our beaches,” said Board Chairman Bob Woodard. “And once again, I’m highly in opposition to offshore drilling.”

“Since 1989, the Town of Kill Devil Hills Board of Commissioners has stated its strong opposition to offshore drilling, seismic testing, and leasing,” according to a call-to-action email sent Wednesday.

“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” the town stated. “Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion.”

“An oil spill would devastate this vital sector, jeopardizing jobs and revenue while harming the pristine marine ecosystem that attracts visitors,” KDH officials stated.

The Nags Head Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on Wednesday also voicing their opposition.

“The Outer Banks region would assume disproportionate environmental and economic risks associated with OCS development while receiving minimal long-term benefit,” the Nags Head resolution states. “Energy companies would profit from resource extraction, while coastal communities bear the consequences of potential spills, degraded tourism, fisheries loss, and the costs of emergency preparedness and response.”

“There is no equitable mechanism currently in place that ensures local communities share in financial returns or have adequate resources to manage increased risks,” Nags Head’s resolution added.

“For the most part, these things do fly under the radar,” said Mayor Ben Cahoon, who also encouraged the public to submit comments. “Thanks to Oceana and similar organizations who watchdog this, we were given a heads up.”

In an email newsletter sent Friday afternoon, the Southern Shores Town Council echoed their colleagues on the north beach.

“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” according to Southern Shores council members.

“Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion,” Southern Shores councilors stated. “An oil spill would devastate this vital sector, jeopardizing jobs and revenue while harming the pristine marine ecosystem that attracts visitors.”

“Even the perception of environmental risk associated with offshore drilling can negatively impact tourism, investment, and business development in coastal areas,” said Southern Shores Mayor Elizabeth Morey in her written comments submitted to BOEM.

“The protection of our coastal environment and economy is a priority for Southern Shores, and the long-term well-being of our community outweighs any short-term benefits that expanded offshore drilling might offer to the oil and gas industry,” Morey said.",https://islandfreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dont-Drill.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 13:05:39.366414

That skews blue, but only by a hair, suggesting that EV infrastructure is one subject where Texans can find common ground regardless of political leaning.
Renewable Energy Is A Key Part Of The Texas Economy According to the Texas Comptroller's office, solar power generated 14,830 jobs for Texas in 2022 alone.
In 2023, Texas produced 108,000 GWh from wind power, and 32,000 GWh from solar, according to the EIA.
Florida came in second, at around a quarter million registrations, and Texas came in third by a nose, at just over 230,000 registrations.","When you think about electric vehicles, the first American state that comes to mind is probably California. Indeed, folks on the Golden Coast buy up more EVs than people in any other state in the country, and California has some of the most, well, let's say forward-thinking emissions laws in the world. But Tesla is actually headquartered out of Austin, Texas, and a new study, coming to us courtesy of Prepaid Electricity (check the link in our sources to read the whole thing) suggests that the Lone Star State could be ready to take the lead in the shift towards a fully-electric American highway.

Here's the headline grabber: Only around a quarter of Americans are ""very likely"" to consider purchasing an EV, according to a J.D. Power study. By and large, Americans are still resisting the shift to electric. But, when we limit the respondents to Texans, according to the Prepaid Electricity poll, nearly half of those in the market for a new car are looking to buy an electric vehicle. Here's what else the study turned up.

The following is based primarily on a study provided by Prepaid Electricity. Additional research has been conducted via government and statistical databases. Any opinions offered thereupon are those of the author unless otherwise attributed.

Texans Are Ahead Of The Curve On Electric

So, here's the thing about electric vehicles; automakers may have pushed a little too hard, too fast, over the last few years, toward a fully battery-powered future. Meaningful change takes time, it's gradual. Old ways are phased out and new ways are phased in. So, sure, you have brands like Ford and Volkswagen retracting their most enthusiastic promises and deciding to let the revolution happen at its own pace. But, that doesn't mean electric cars aren't the future, it only means that it won't happen overnight.

Public support is a big part of that change. If we want infrastructure support for more EV charging stations, if automakers want to sell these things in the first place, you need drivers, and voters, on your side. And the battle for hearts and minds seems all but won in Texas, based on the fact that:

Three in four Texans support expanding infrastructure across the state.

Gen Z and Millennial Texans are especially supportive of infrastructure expansion, at four in five, but Baby Boomers are surprisingly enthusiastic, as well, with two in three voicing support for EV infrastructure.

Of Texans planning to buy a new car in the next year, 44% of Baby Boomers, and 43% of Gen X, are planning to buy an electric vehicle. The number jumps to an even 50% for younger drivers.

EV infrastructure expansion is fairly non-partisan in Texas, earning approval from 84% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans. That skews blue, but only by a hair, suggesting that EV infrastructure is one subject where Texans can find common ground regardless of political leaning.

The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area showed the most support for EV expansion, at 79%. This is followed by the Austin and Houston areas, at 78% and 74%, respectively.

There's Still Plenty Of Resistance And Suspicion

Texans are the poster boys and girsl for American principles of rugged individualism, so you're naturally going to see some distrust and resistance, even among those who are, in theory, fully on board with electric cars.

Two in five Texans feel that the federal government is pushing EV adoption a little too aggressively, and the consensus is that big corporations, plus wealthy and middle-class families, will reap the greatest benefits of clean energy policies, with only 6% of respondents believing low-income households will claim the lion's share of savings. 53% of Texans feel that the state's power grid will need to be upgraded if it's to support expanded EV infrastructure, which sounds like a reasonable concern.

Ultimately, 64% of Texans feel that gas-powered vehicles are a part of Texas culture, and that includes 59% of Gen Z respondents. Honestly, that's a hard point to disagree with, no matter your personal feelings on the matter. Texas produces 43% of the nation's crude oil and 27% of our natural gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. It's the land of full-size pickups, like the Silverado and the F-150. This isn't necessarily an anti-EV thing, it's just an acknowledgment of gasoline's unshakable place in Texas culture.

Texas Is One Of The Greenest States In The US

If you know a bit about Texas, there's nothing too surprising about this study (other than the fact that 5% of EV owners are against expanded infrastructure, for some reason). Texas littering fines start at a cool five hundred bucks, and can rack up five figures in penalties, plus several months of jail time, for repeat offenses. The state has nearly 73,000 miles of beautiful highway, and they intend to keep it beautiful.

Renewable Energy Is A Key Part Of The Texas Economy

According to the Texas Comptroller's office, solar power generated 14,830 jobs for Texas in 2022 alone. In 2023, Texas produced 108,000 GWh from wind power, and 32,000 GWh from solar, according to the EIA.

The state is home to initiatives like the Clean Energy Fund of Texas, pumping much-needed funding into green energy projects, and, according to the Comptroller, the state boasts more than 15,300 wind turbines (more than any other state) across 100,000 acres of wind farms.

This is all to say that it's unsurprising to find that Texas is on board with the shift toward electric vehicles, and for reasons of principle, as much as practicality. California gets all the credit, but Texas is right there on the frontline with them, pushing for more environmentally-friendly, sustainable energy sources.

Texas Is Already Claiming Its Share Of The EV Market

According to the EIA, California still holds the lead for most electric vehicle registrations by state, as of the end of 2023, with more than one million in total. Florida came in second, at around a quarter million registrations, and Texas came in third by a nose, at just over 230,000 registrations.

If 230,000 units doesn't sound like a whole lot (remember, that's the grand total, not annual registrations), bear in mind that fourth place goes to Washington state with barely more than 150,000 registrations. From there, the gap just gets wider, with New York and New Jersey both accounting for just over 130,000 registrations, and all remaining states not even cracking six figures.

There's no denying that the future is electric, but we won't get there until the public is on board. Any automaker looking to sell more EVs might be wise to look at Texas and see what makes the product so attractive in the Land of the Midnight Sun.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vlcsnap-2025-04-15-16h18m00s992.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:10:03.511624

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific. Even EVs from the same brand can use different types of batteries, each containing numerous components,"" Kumara said.

As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is currently attracting numerous international EV automakers and nickel miners.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citron, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer. For this reason, ""It's interesting because China is known for its strong EV component industry. We encourage our local companies to learn from Chinese firms."" Kumara said.

Now, they are being reimagined as hubs for clean energy innovation.
Scotland’s Acorn project and the Viking initiative in the Humber are further examples of clean energy development being rolled out nationwide.
It can also be used for long-duration energy storage, helping to stabilise the grid during periods of high demand.
Britain is investing in clean energy not just to meet its net-zero targets but also to revitalise its economy, build strategic resilience, and create meaningful employment.","The UK government has announced over £500 million in funding to expand the country's hydrogen infrastructure. This investment is part of the broader Plan for Change, an initiative designed to position Britain as a global leader in clean energy.

At the heart of this funding package is the creation of the nation’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network. For the first time, hydrogen producers will be directly linked to major end-users such as power stations and industrial plants. This is a milestone moment that signals a shift toward a more self-reliant and decarbonised energy future.

Thousands of skilled jobs are expected to emerge in key industrial areas like Merseyside, Teesside, and the Humber. These are communities that have long been defined by heavy industry. Now, they are being reimagined as hubs for clean energy innovation.

The economic impact will not be limited to the borders of these regions. The broader supply chain will also benefit, creating opportunities in manufacturing, logistics, engineering, and maintenance. In short, this investment is designed to ripple across the entire economy while reducing our reliance on international fossil fuel markets.

The announcement builds on a series of job-creating initiatives confirmed in the recent Spending Review. At Sizewell C in Suffolk, 10,000 new jobs are expected as part of a major nuclear power project. Meanwhile, a new fusion reactor is set to be constructed on the site of a former coal station in Nottinghamshire, bringing high-tech energy production to the region.

The small modular reactor programme is also gaining traction. This initiative is projected to create up to 3,000 additional jobs and is receiving dedicated funding support. Scotland’s Acorn project and the Viking initiative in the Humber are further examples of clean energy development being rolled out nationwide.

Many of these projects are designed to support industrial sectors that are likely to be among the first to adopt hydrogen solutions. Think iron and steel manufacturing, glass production, chemical processing, and ceramics. These are the sectors that form the backbone of the UK’s industrial legacy, and they are being positioned for a cleaner, more resilient future.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain.

“By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.”

Hydrogen plays a special role in Britain’s evolving energy system. It is not just a fuel. It is a flexible energy carrier that can help decarbonise the toughest sectors, from refineries to long-haul freight transport. It can also be used for long-duration energy storage, helping to stabilise the grid during periods of high demand.

Government support is already accelerating production. The continued rollout of Hydrogen Allocation Rounds builds on the early success of the first funding wave, which committed over £2 billion to 11 pilot projects.

“Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition,” explained Brett Ryan, Head of Policy and Analysis at Hydrogen UK.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, added: “By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.”

These efforts have helped attract £400 million in private sector investment so far, with activity concentrated in locations such as Milford Haven and High Marnham.

This public-private collaboration is essential to scaling the sector. With it comes a surge in employment opportunities, not just for senior engineers and executives but also for apprentices, graduates, and skilled tradespeople. Roles will open up for welders, pipefitters, construction workers, and operations technicians, offering long-term career paths in a future-facing industry.

The goal is clear. Britain is investing in clean energy not just to meet its net-zero targets but also to revitalise its economy, build strategic resilience, and create meaningful employment. This is not just about switching to a different fuel. It is about transforming communities, modernising infrastructure, and ensuring that the next generation of workers has a place in the global energy transition.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_ea68647437274045824844bcf0eb01fa~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_ea68647437274045824844bcf0eb01fa~mv2.webp",N,,2025-06-14 14:07:26.886974
,Texas American Energy ,2025-06-14 15:24:56+00:00,The Hill,The decline of coal isn't a conspiracy — it's the market reality,"Benji Backer, opinion contributor, Benji Backer, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5347638-coal-decline-not-political-vendetta/,"Coal’s decline in the U.S. did not start with asset managers or so-called “environmental, social and governance” or ESG investment policies.
Asset managers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their investments, as their fiduciary duty to their clients demands.
We know this because coal’s decline happened in both public and private coal companies.
Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports.
Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients.","A core misunderstanding fuels a recent lawsuit that has made headlines. The Republican attorneys general of Texas and 10 other states have accused some of the nation’s largest asset managers of “colluding” to harm coal companies, claiming falsely that the decline of coal is the result of some coordinated political vendetta rather than simple, demonstrable market economics.

With the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission joining the conversation, it is important to delve into the details and consider market trends over the past few decades.

Coal’s decline in the U.S. did not start with asset managers or so-called “environmental, social and governance” or ESG investment policies. It started decades ago, with the shale gas revolution, when fracking technology unleashed an abundant, cheap and cleaner-burning alternative. U.S. Energy Information Administration data show that U.S. coal production was 1.13 trillion short tons in 2001, but by 2020 that number had declined to 535 billion short tons — its lowest level since 1965.

Natural gas outcompeted coal because it made economic sense. It has lower operating costs, fewer regulatory burdens and, perhaps most importantly, reduced environmental impact. Add in the drop in the cost of renewables, and coal’s decline was predictable. Asset managers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their investments, as their fiduciary duty to their clients demands.

This is about economics, not ideology — business decisions, not politics.

Power utilities, manufacturers and even global markets have made decisions based on price, efficiency and reliability. We know this because coal’s decline happened in both public and private coal companies. Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports. Capital flows based on competitive advantage, not political talking points.

What these attorneys general attempt to frame as “coal collusion” is, in fact, a textbook example of fiduciary responsibility and following industry direction.

Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients. When coal projects increasingly face uncertain demand, regulatory headwinds and operational volatility, it is prudent investing to limit exposure. The lawsuit itself notes that coal production increased (incrementally) in 2021, the first year of the supposed “conspiracy.” This further shows the inconsistency of the argument, raising questions about whether the lawsuit is really about coal or about weaponizing an economic trend — a dangerous precedent to set.

We must be honest about what’s happening to coal, and to energy more broadly. Rather than distort reality for short-term political gain, let’s focus on developing solutions that respect our economic system, support innovation and ensure energy security.

The real conversation we should be having is about ensuring energy abundance through all means. Let’s talk about how to accelerate nuclear energy, streamline permitting for cleaner domestic production, invest in resilient grid infrastructure, and maintain American leadership in next-generation energy technologies. Allowing for a truly “all of the above” energy strategy enables investments in diverse, dependable and secure energy sources.

Climate, energy and market decisions are complex and intertwined. They deserve meticulous debate. It’s time to refocus the conversation on pragmatism and opportunity — not partisan politicking.

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

The Shire of Narrogin, about 180 kilometres south-east of Perth, has been considered prime territory for wind, solar and battery because of its open farmland and proximity to the state's grid.

Projects proposed for the Narrogin Renewable Energy Zone include a $2.4 billion, 168-turbine wind farm of 1209 megawatts, a $400M solar farm and a $400M battery project.

Narrogin Shire President Leigh Ballard said the council had welcomed the projects for their economic benefits but wanted a community fund created so residents could benefit.

The shire recently requested the battery project include a community fund or public art funding, which was rejected.

Mr Ballard said the growth of the projects was putting stress on the community and its infrastructure.

""It's an issue we, as a shire, are trying process, comprehend and plan for,"" he said.

""Each individual project has a small impact, but when you put all these projects together it's a huge impact for the region.""

He said pressure points included housing, roads, general resources, procedures and baseline community functions.

Community fund draft

The WA government released draft guidelines on Thursday which said it would ensure ""all Western Australians benefit from the energy transition"".

It said community arrangements on projects differed and a lack of consistency created uncertainty for communities and proponents.

The proposed guidelines include $500 to $,1000 per megawatt per year for wind projects and $150 to $800 for solar projects.

Under the proposal, a 200-megawatt wind farm project would contribute between $100,00 to $300,000 each year, the government said.

It said the final benefit could differ depending on the size of community and whether multiple communities were affected.

""In sparsely populated areas, a lower … amount may be appropriate compared to areas of higher population,"" it said.

The draft proposed community funds could be administered through local governments or a community trust fund.

Need for legislation

Mr Ballard said the situation required clear-cut legislation from the Cook government.

""Our community is getting told what's happening, they're not getting brought along with the process or involved with it,"" he said.

""We look at it as a bit of social license from these projects, coming into the community and changing our landscape.""

WA Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said the government had listened to industry and communities to develop the concept.

""The draft guideline provides support for the community and renewable energy developers to achieve sensible arrangements that balance benefit for the local community with the affordability of energy,"" she said in a statement.

Planning Minister John Carey said WA was in a ""critical moment in the state's history"" with large renewable projects proposed and under construction.

""It's a significant opportunity in terms of economy, for jobs, and meeting the renewable energy transitions but we understand there are concerns in local communities and what the community benefit will be,"" he said.

Seeking balance

Energy analyst Ray Wills said baseline payments per hour or megawatt per project were a sensible starting point.

He said the direct benefits of farmers and other landholders hosting projects needed to be balanced against the indirect impact on the wider community.

""Because otherwise all of the expenditure that company will look to do will be captured by one person, rather than being more broadly available,"" Mr Wills said.

""On the other hand, not having any of those payments made to the community is going to see a restriction of projects going forward.""

Solar tax credits can take thousands of dollars off the cost, making solar energy more viable for the average American.
What's being done to save solar incentives?","Solar energy experts are worried for the state of solar — here's why.

What's happening?

Solar panels are a great way to save money on energy bills while reducing your household's carbon footprint, but valuable incentives allowing homeowners to affordably access panels are at risk.

The loss of these incentives could be disastrous for customers and the industry, as detailed in a YouTube short by EnergySage.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded the Residential Clean Energy Credit, allowing eligible homeowners to claim a tax credit on solar panel installation.

Over 750,000 Americans were able to install home solar in 2023 thanks to the IRA credits, according to The New York Times.

However, the House of Representatives has passed the reconciliation bill, which includes expediting the end of the 30% residential solar tax credit.

The tax credit originally had a phase-out date of 2034, but if the Senate passes the bill, the solar tax credit will end in 2025 — nearly a decade early.

The effects of this bill could be catastrophic for homeowners and local businesses. Kyle Elpel, the owner of Serv Solar in California, warned that ""a dramatic drop-off will literally kill the industry in about a dozen states,"" per an EnergySage YouTube short.

Why are solar tax credits important?

Going solar is one of the best ways to save money on home energy while helping the environment, but one of the biggest barriers to accessing the benefits of solar is the upfront installation cost.

Prices vary, but the average system is around $33,000 before incentives. EnergySage has quick, easy-to-use, free tools to help you find estimates and compare quotes, and access the incentives available to you.

Solar tax credits can take thousands of dollars off the cost, making solar energy more viable for the average American. Without available incentives, many homeowners would be unable to install solar, and with fewer customers, many solar companies could go out of business.

""We are now 100% running our house off solar with a battery backup, and I don't think we would have been able to do that without tax credits,"" solar customer Sam Potasznik told EnergySage.

What's being done to save solar incentives?

EnergySage urged Americans to contact their local representatives and ask them to save Section 25D, also known as the Residential Clean Energy Credit.

The fate of the incentives is uncertain; it could be valuable to act quickly now and potentially save yourself thousands.

If the Senate passes the bill, homeowners only have until the end of the year to make the switch to solar. If you're interested in solar panels but aren't sure where to start, EnergySage offers tools and resources that make installation easier than ever. With installation quotes, savings estimates, and verified contractors, EnergySage will help you get the lowest price on the best system, potentially providing up to $10,000 off the total cost.

The cost of installation varies by state, as do the incentives. EnergySage's mapping tool can show you each state's average installation cost and specific incentive offerings.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-tax-creditimage-recfrrhtRTgXRf572.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:09:59.201923

The administration also planned an analysis of how to meet the region’s energy needs without sacrificing salmon.
When Trump took office and slashed thousands of jobs from the Department of Energy, the commitment for new energy sources died too.
But some Columbia River hatcheries are nearly a century old.","Less than two years ago, the administration of President Joe Biden announced what tribal leaders hailed as an unprecedented commitment to the Native tribes whose ways of life had been devastated by federal dam-building along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest.

The deal, which took two years to negotiate, halted decades of lawsuits over the harm federal dams had caused to the salmon that had sustained those tribes culturally and economically for thousands of years. To enable the removal of four hydroelectric dams considered especially harmful to salmon, the government promised to invest billions of dollars in alternative energy sources to be created by the tribes.

It was a remarkable step following repeated failures by the government to uphold the tribal fishing rights it swore in treaties to preserve.

The agreement is now just another of those broken promises.

President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Thursday pulling the federal government out of the deal. Trump’s decision halted a government-wide initiative to restore abundant salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake rivers and signaled an end to the government’s willingness to consider removing dams that blocked their free flow.

Thursday’s move drew immediate condemnation from tribes and from environmental groups that have fought to protect salmon.

“The Administration’s decision to terminate these commitments echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes,” Yakama Nation Tribal Council Chair Gerald Lewis said in a statement. “This termination will severely disrupt vital fisheries restoration efforts, eliminate certainty for hydro operations, and likely result in increased energy costs and regional instability.”

The government’s commitment to tribes, however, had been unraveling since almost when the deal was inked.

Key provisions were already languishing under Biden. After Trump won the presidency, his administration spiked most of the studies called for in the agreement, held up millions of dollars in funding and cut most of the staff working to implement salmon recovery. Biden’s promise to seriously consider the removal of dams gained little traction before it was replaced by what Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, called “passionate support” for keeping them in place.

The chair of the White House task force to implement the agreement quit in April because of what he saw as Trump’s efforts to eliminate nearly everything he was working on.

“Federal agencies who were on the hook to do the work were being destroyed through untargeted, inefficient and costly purges of federal employees,” Nik Blosser, the former Columbia River Task Force chair, told ProPublica and OPB. “When I left, most things were on hold or paused — even signed contracts were on hold, which is a disgrace.”

Trump’s White House announcement called the Biden administration’s commitments “onerous” and said the president “continues to deliver on his promise to end the previous administration’s misplaced priorities and protect the livelihoods of the American people.”

“President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy dominance, reversing all executive actions that impose undue burdens on energy production and use,” the announcement read.

But the decision could also have some unintended consequences, experts say.

Trump signed an executive order in April to “restore American seafood competitiveness” but in revoking the Columbia River agreement has canceled millions of dollars to support the programs that seed the ocean with fish to catch. He signed a separate executive order on his first day in office to “unleash American energy dominance” but has now reversed a commitment, made under the Biden salmon deal, to build new sources of domestic energy. This week’s action has sent federal agencies back to court, where judges have repeatedly shackled power production at hydroelectric dams because of its impact on the endangered fish.

“It’s tempting to comment at length on the absurdity of the President’s order, including the fact that what he says he wants — stability for power generation — is in fact put more at risk by this action,” Blosser wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “Instead, I’ll look for inspiration to the mighty salmon, who don’t stop swimming upstream when they get to a waterfall.”

Back to court

Before they began negotiating the Columbia River Basin agreement in 2021, federal agencies had been losing in court over the hydropower system for more than 20 years. Judge after judge ordered the federal government to use less water for making electricity and instead let more of the river spill through the dams’ floodgates so that fish could more safely ride the current past them.

The accord with states and tribes guaranteed up to a decade without those lawsuits. Trump canceled that.

The Bonneville Power Administration, which sells the hydroelectricity from federal dams, had more at stake than the rest of the agencies in the deal. When the government signed it, Bonneville Administrator John Hairston said it provided “operational certainty and reliability while avoiding costly, unpredictable litigation in support of our mission to provide a reliable, affordable power supply to the Pacific Northwest.”

In its most recent annual report, Bonneville credited the agreement for giving it the flexibility to increase hydropower production during times of high electricity demand, which helped stem the losses in an otherwise difficult financial year.

A major component of the agreement was the acknowledgment of the region’s dependence on hydropower and the need to build new sources of energy before removing the dams. It offered no guarantee of dam removal.

The Biden White House had pledged to help tribes develop enough renewable energy sources to replace the output of four dams on the Snake River, which salmon advocates have long wanted to remove. The administration also planned an analysis of how to meet the region’s energy needs without sacrificing salmon.

The Biden administration never followed through. Even tribally backed energy projects that were already in progress ran into bureaucratic quagmires. When Trump took office and slashed thousands of jobs from the Department of Energy, the commitment for new energy sources died too.

Proponents of Columbia River dams, including the publicly owned utilities that buy federal hydroelectricity, criticized the Biden administration for leaving them out of the negotiations that led to the agreement.

“I want to thank the President (Trump) for his decisive action to protect our dams,” Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Central Washington, said in a statement on Thursday. He said the Biden administration and “extreme environmental activists” would have threatened the reliability of the power grid and raised energy prices with dam removal.

Even critics of the Biden deal, however, acknowledge they do not want the issue to return to court, where judges’ orders have driven up electricity rates. When Bonneville can’t generate as much hydropower to sell, but still has to pay for hatcheries and habitat fixes for salmon, it has to charge utilities more for its electricity.

“I’m hoping that we avoid dam operations by injunction, because that doesn’t help anybody in the region,” said Scott Simms, executive director of the Public Power Council, a nonprofit representing utilities that purchase federal hydropower.

Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin, who represents the environmental advocates who signed the agreement, said the Trump administration’s actions would force a return to courts.

“The agreement formed the basis for the stay of litigation,” Goodin said, “so without the agreement there is no longer any basis for a stay.”

More fish will die

The White House said that Trump’s revoking of the Columbia River deal shows that he “continues to prioritize our Nation’s energy infrastructure and use of natural resources to lower the cost of living for all Americans over speculative climate change concerns.”

Shannon Wheeler, chair of the Nez Perce Tribe, said the damage on the Columbia River is anything but speculative.

“This action tries to hide from the truth,” Wheeler said in a statement. “The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now.”

Wild salmon populations on the Columbia and its largest tributary, the Snake River, have been so sparse for decades that commercial, recreational and tribal subsistence fishing are only possible because of fish hatcheries, which raise millions of baby salmon in pens and release them into the wild when they’re old enough to swim to the ocean.

In some years, an estimated half of all the Chinook salmon commercial fishermen catch in Southeast Alaska are from Columbia River hatcheries, making them critical for “restoring American seafood competitiveness” as Trump aimed to do.

But some Columbia River hatcheries are nearly a century old. Others have been so badly underfunded that equipment failures have killed thousands of baby fish.

As ProPublica and OPB previously reported, the number of hatchery salmon surviving to adulthood is now so low that hatcheries have struggled to collect enough fish for breeding, putting future fishing seasons in jeopardy.

The Biden administration promised roughly $500 million to improve hatcheries across the Northwest. His administration never delivered it, and Trump halted all the funds before eventually canceling them with this week’s order.

Mary Lou Soscia, former Columbia River coordinator at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the administration’s dismantling of salmon recovery programs amounts to “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

“We’re losing decades of accomplishments,” said Soscia, who spent more than 30 years at the agency.

“When the fish managers aren’t there to make real time river decisions, more fish will die,” she said. “Or the watershed restoration work will take a lot longer to happen because you won’t have funding, and more fish will die.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e95a571/2147483647/strip/true/crop/767x403+0+78/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fbb%2Fb7ded6764f3b91d4ad2af098271f%2Fsalmon-viewing-area-bonneville-dam-opb.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:53.154891

As governments introduced financial incentives for EV uptake alongside emissions fees and eventual bans on ICE vehicles, automakers expected the sale of EVs to soar. However, due to a range of factors, EV sales are lower than they were expected in many parts of the world, with no sign of increasing significantly any time soon. This has encouraged many automakers to reassess their strategies, with some turning their attention back to hybrid vehicles that offer the best of both worlds.

EV sales are gradually increasing, but not at anywhere near the rate previously anticipated for most automakers. Some of the main reasons cited for the slowdown in the growth in EV sales include the high cost of EVs, difficulties in charging – from the high cost of installing a home charger to the lack of public charging infrastructure, and the low range of many existing EV models. Fears over the inability to charge an EV on a journey, the time wasted at a charging station, and the low range of EVs, as perceived by consumers, have led many to view EVs as a supplement rather than a replacement for ICE vehicles.

In 2023 and 2024, the growth in sales of hybrid vehicles increased while EV sales growth slowed, suggesting that many consumers are looking to make the switch but are more open to a compromise than to taking the leap to fully electric. In the U.S. market, several automakers have increased their hybrid vehicle production capacity over the last year in response to the growing market demand. The global sale of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 29 percent year-on-year in April, with growth in both China and Europe. However, North America recorded the first decline since last September, amid growing economic uncertainty.

One type of vehicle that is gaining increasing attention is the extended-range electric vehicle (EREV). This is a type of plug-in hybrid that is positioned between conventional hybrids and wholly electric vehicles, relying on battery-powered motors for propulsion and containing a small gas engine that can be used as a generator to charge batteries. The batteries are bigger than those of a traditional hybrid vehicle, while the gas engines are smaller.

EREVs appeared to go out of fashion, or perhaps were never in fashion, with low sales figures for the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma in the U.S. when they entered the market in 2011. GM did manage to sell around 157,000 of its Volt over nine years, making it the best-selling EREV in the U.S., but it is still comparatively low compared to other types of vehicles. Since BMW’s i3 was discontinued in 2022, there have been no new EREVs in the U.S. market, but that is soon expected to change.

There are several EREVs in the pipeline, including a version of the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, as well as Volkswagen models under the Scout brand name. Hyundai and Nissan are also reportedly planning to develop their EREV models in response to increased market demand. Some of these models could offer over 560 miles of range, making them much more appealing to consumers concerned about charging restrictions. Because they use smaller batteries than conventional EVs, they are also generally cheaper to produce, bringing the sales price down.

Eric Anderson, the associate director of Americas light vehicle powertrain forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, explained that hybrids, including EREVs, are a “relatively affordable way for consumers to move up the electrification ladder without a significant monthly payment increase.”

And it’s not only in the U.S. that automakers are turning their attention to hybrid vehicles, as Chinese automakers are seeing a rising demand for hybrids at the international level. In 2024, Charles Lester, a data manager at Rho Motion, said China-based EV makers were continuing to increase domestic sales of battery EVs while responding to growing demand for plug-in hybrids offshore. Lester stated, “The plug-in hybrids have almost doubled year to date in the rest of the world, but the main reason for that is the Chinese exports.”

However, hybrid vehicles even appear to be becoming more popular among Chinese consumers. The Chinese automaker BYD announced in January that it had sold around 4.3 million passenger cars in 2024, almost 2.5 million of which were hybrid vehicles. Joe McCabe, the president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, said, “We still see growth in the Chinese market in terms of battery electric, but we see it sort of capping.” McCabe expects that by 2031, there will still be demand for ICE vehicles, including hybrid vehicles.

As consumers worldwide battle growing economic uncertainty, particularly in the wake of the U.S. sanctions on a wide range of foreign goods, many are reluctant to invest in a wholly electric vehicle. Meanwhile, EV makers have failed to provide consumers with the confidence needed to invest in EVs, such as ensuring a lower price tag, adequate access to charging infrastructure, and a long range. This has driven many consumers to invest their money in a hybrid vehicle, seeing it as the best of both worlds and showing their openness to gradually shifting away from fossil fuels to electric.

US President Donald Trump vaulted into his second term in office on a mission to boost US coal, oil, and gas production. As promised, all three resources were tapped for priority status under the “National Energy Emergency” declaration issued by the White House on January 20. Geothermal energy was included as well, and the US geothermal industry is ready to answer the call. New Mexico alone, for example, is sitting on 163 gigawatts worth of geothermal energy according to a new assessment.

Geothermal Energy Gets A Big Thumbs-Up

The National Energy Emergency declaration of January 20 launched with this observation: “We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.”

Two of the most readily accessible and affordable energy resources in the US — wind and sunshine — failed to make the Energy Emergency cut, but these ones squeezed through (emphasis added):

The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).

Reading through the list, you’ll see that geothermal is not the only renewable resource to be embraced under the national emergency tent. Biofuels and hydropower (“the kinetic movement of flowing water) are also included.

However, the emergency declaration did not automatically protect every item on the list. Congress also had to pick up the ball, which it has not. At least, not yet. Last month the Republican-controlled House of Representatives sent the BBB — the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” aka the federal budget bill — to the Senate without the tax provisions needed to support the nation’s hydropower and geothermal industries.

A New Era For Geothermal Energy

That’s not the end of either industry. The members of the Republican-controlled Senate are entitled to tweak the BBB to make it make sense before sending it back to the House. Perhaps they will, perhaps they won’t. If you know where your Senators stand on the matter, drop a note in the comment thread.

Meanwhile, the US geothermal industry is finally shaking off a decades-long coating of dust to spread its wings and fly. If geothermal tax credits go away under the final BBB, the timing is not ideal for a geothermal renaissance in the US, but the data center construction boom could provide the industry with a supportive environment for rapid expansion. The US Department of Defense is also pursuing the prize of 24/7 clean power at or near its facilities.

The fact is that the US is sitting on a mother lode of geothermal energy, but until now it has barely been tapped for power generation. That’s because only a few, scattered locations west of the Rocky Mountains provide the right combination of naturally occurring water, heat, and rock to produce electricity. A commercially viable business model is another ingredient that has been missing from the picture.

Well, that was then. All throughout the first Trump administration and into the Biden years, the US Department of Energy was pushing forward with R&D programs supporting new, enhanced geothermal systems, which borrow drilling methods from the oil and gas industry to fabricate the necessary underground conditions for geothermal heat and/or power generation, enabling the industry to spread into many more parts of the US (see more EGS background here).

New Mexico Is Sitting On 163 Gigawatts Of Geothermal Energy

As for how much geothermal energy is suddenly available, the US Geological Survey has begun deploying new mapping tools to assess the power generation potential, beginning with the Great Basin region covering much of Nevada. Earlier this year USGS issued a preliminary determination of 135 gigawatts, which is the equivalent of about 10% of the nation’s overall generating capacity. In contrast, the nation’s current supply of geothermal generating capacity barely registers, at less than 1%.

The Williston Basin in North Dakota is next on the US Geological survey to-do list, but the state of New Mexico, for one, is not waiting around to see what happens next.

The New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources has partnered with the The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the non-profit organization Project InnerSpace to assess their own state’s geothermal energy resources. They came up with a total of 163 gigawatts. To put that into perspective, that’s more than 15 times the existing power generation capacity in New Mexico as in 2023.

The findings are described in a report titled, “The Future of Geothermal in New Mexico,” released to the public on June 12 by Project InnerSpace.

Giving credit where credit is due, Project InnerSpace credits the oil and gas industry with lending its technology to the effort.

“A new report made public today finds that New Mexico’s particular combination of abundant subsurface heat, well-developed technical expertise from the oil & gas and traditional geothermal industries, and support from political leaders make it exceptionally well suited to exponentially grow its geothermal development,” Project InnerSpace explained in a press statement.

According to the findings, geothermal power, heating, and/or cooling potential exists everywhere in New Mexico, not just in a few places. “Almost all of the western half of the state has enough subsurface heat potential for power generation,” Project InnerSpace notes.

For the record, New Mexico currently has just one geothermal power plant on its roster.

Data Centers And The DoD

The new report also outlines policy recommendations to get the geothermal energy wheels in motion, while underscoring the potential for transferring oil and gas employment into the geothermal industry. That’s a key consideration because New Mexico currently bills itself as the second-largest producer of oil and gas in the US.

“The report also noted that New Mexico could be a top state for the development of geothermal-powered data centers,” Project InnerSpace concludes.

As if on cue, on June 12 Meta (the parent company of Facebook) let word slip that a new 150-megawatt geothermal energy project is in the works in partnership with the startup XGS Energy., aimed at supporting its data center operations in New Mexico.

XGS has come up with its own variation on advanced geothermal technology, with a focus on eliminating water from the equation. “XGS Energy’s proprietary geothermal technology, which enables geothermal power production with zero operating water use, will be deployed to the PNM electric grid and support Meta’s data center operations in New Mexico, demonstrating that energy demand can be met with clean, water-independent baseload power,” XGS explains.

XGS also emphasizes that the Meta project alone will increase geothermal electricity capacity in the state by a factor of 10. That will happen by 2030, once the two-phase construction timeline is completed and the project is fully built out.

Keep an eye out for more news from XGS. Earlier this year, the company joined a select group of geothermal energy firms to earn pre-qualification status from the US Air Force, entitling them to bid on contracts for new USAF geothermal projects as well as other branches of the US Department of Defense.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/geothermal-energy-us-doe-enhanced-systems-.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 15:05:04.607141

The seventh and eighth films in the franchise revolve around a rogue artificial intelligence (AI) entity taking over cyberspace, with different nations racing against the clock to capture this entity and dominate the rest of the globe. The plot today may be different, but the emerging battle for AI-supremacy seems similar.

Recently, President Trump issued four executive orders aimed at unleashing nuclear energy to establish America’s “energy dominance” and maintain national security amid a potential global AI arms race. These orders could lead to the repeal or reform of burdensome regulations that have constrained the American nuclear industry in past decades. Did I expect national security to be a key driver of nuclear energy reform? Not exactly, but this is not an unprecedented scenario.

From the battlefield to the home front

At the height of World War II, nations began working to apply atomic physics to wartime technology. This led to America achieving the world’s first self-sustaining nuclear reaction under the stands of Stagg Field in Chicago. While nuclear technology’s first use was in the atom bomb, its debut as an energy source came soon after with the launch of the USS Nautilus in 1954.

Since then, the technology has had a prominent role in both military and civilian affairs. Nuclear reactors are used to power submarines and aircraft carriers, and 19% of the United States’ electricity generation comes from nuclear power plants. National security had a role in its origin story — and now, it may be a factor in the nuclear industry’s resurgence as well.

An opportunity for Missouri

To win an AI arms race, speed and time are of the essence. Missouri could position itself as a strategic partner by finding ways to more quickly connect new nuclear power to energy-intensive AI data centers.

One policy that could shorten the time of construction of nuclear power plants and also protect Missouri consumers from price hikes is consumer regulated electricity (CRE).

In theory, CRE would allow private investors to create new, independent electric power systems (encompassing both generation and transmission) using their own capital. These private grids would be scaled to meet new demand growth from large consumers. In order for a CRE entity to operate appropriately, it would need to be free from restrictions placed by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC). That means CRE systems would need to be unconnected to the regular grid and serve only new industrial and large commercial customers — like AI data centers.

While CRE could accelerate the deployment of new nuclear power, it could be used with natural gas plants, newly built or reactivated coal plants, solar farms, and other generation sources. The key is enabling private developers to respond directly to the energy demands of large customers.

CRE could not only attract investment but also relieve strain on the primary grid and ratepayers. Rather than relying on ratepayers to fund new power plants to accommodate rising electricity demand (driven by large consumers), CRE could provide a targeted solution. New Hampshire passed a CRE measure this year, and Missouri may benefit from evaluating how its statutes could be amended to allow for such innovation.

By connecting it directly with national security, the Trump administration has made the development of nuclear-energy infrastructure an urgent priority. The mission for Missouri — if our policymakers choose to accept it — is to position the state to take part in the revitalization of nuclear power and reap the accompanying economic benefits. Adopting CRE is one important way in which Missouri could help meet the nation’s needs while benefiting in the process.

The numbers that matter An operating nuclear plant lives or dies on capacity factor: how steadily it sends power to the grid.","Plant Vogtle’s newest unit did something no American reactor had managed since the 1990s: it came online. On April 7, Georgia Power flipped Vogtle Unit 4 to commercial operation, adding 1,114 megawatts of carbon‑free power to the Southeast grid.

The project blew past every budget prediction —roughly $35 billion for two new units— but the payoff is real and humming. The reactor’s debut closes a long drought in U.S. nuclear construction and opens a new chapter built on safer designs, deeper climate goals, and fresh investor interest.

What makes Vogtle 4 different from your parents’ gen reactor

Vogtle 4 uses the Westinghouse AP1000, a Generation III+ pressurized‑water design loaded with passive‑safety features. Massive gravity‑fed water tanks sit above the reactor vessel; if power dies, valves pop open and natural convection keeps the core cool for three days without a pump or operator. Fewer pipes and valves (about half as many as older Gen II plants) leave less chance of leaks.

The thick containment shell can shrug off an airliner strike or a hefty Georgia tremor. And the entire system comes with a 60‑year license that regulators can extend to 80, giving one reactor a career that spans three generations of engineers.

All that engineering didn’t come cheap. The expansion started in 2013 with a $7 billion estimate for both units. Then came first‑of‑kind component hiccups, post‑Fukushima rule changes, contractor swaps, and pandemic supply snarls. The final bill makes Vogtle the priciest power‑plant build in U.S. history. Supporters respond that every weld, inspection, and lesson learned is now baked into Westinghouse’s playbook. Poland, Ukraine, and at least one Midwest utility are already lining up their own AP1000 projects.

The numbers that matter

An operating nuclear plant lives or dies on capacity factor: how steadily it sends power to the grid. Existing U.S. reactors average 92 percent. If Vogtle 4 pulls the same, it will output about one gigawatt around the clock… enough to light 500,000 typical homes. Paired with Vogtle’s three other units, the site now produces almost five gigawatts, making it the largest generating station in America.

Georgia regulators calculate the two new reactors will displace six million tons of carbon dioxide every year compared with a modern gas plant, the equivalent of pulling 1.3 million cars off the road.

Money flows too. Unit 4 keeps 800 permanent, high‑skill jobs on site and supports thousands more in maintenance, security, and supply. Local counties anticipate $3 billion in tax receipts over the reactor’s life: funding schools, fire departments, and roadwork in towns that used to rely on timber and farming.

The next wave: smaller, faster, and flexible

Vogtle proves America can still erect gigawatt‑scale reactors, but it may also be the last of its kind. Engineers have shifted to nimble designs that tuck into retiring coal sites.

In Wyoming, Bill Gates‑backed TerraPower broke ground on a 345‑MW Natrium reactor cooled by liquid sodium and paired with molten‑salt thermal storage. That storage lets the plant ramp to 500 MW at sunset, exactly when solar output dips. In Tennessee, the Tennessee Valley Authority plans a BWRX‑300boiling‑water SMR at its Clinch River site. Factory‑built modules could roll off assembly lines like wind‑turbine hubs, cutting on‑site work to a fraction of Vogtle’s.

Lessons from Georgia already lubricate these projects. Supply chains are lined up earlier, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews module designs instead of bespoke blueprints, and federal loan guarantees trim borrowing costs that once sank earlier nuclear proposals.

Renewable synergy, not rivalry

Clean energy no longer feels like a zero‑sum game. Georgia’s solar capacity has surged over the past decade; Vogtle’s steady output lets grid operators back off fossil peakers when clouds roll in. Analysts compare the mix to a hybrid car: solar for the zip around town, nuclear as the efficient highway engine. With battery costs inching lower but still pricey, firm nuclear watts keep wholesale prices stable and cut the need for oversized storage.

Surveys from the Pew Research Center show support for nuclear climbs when respondents learn reactors emit no greenhouse gases and new designs rely on passive safety. Vogtle’s clean startup adds a concrete example to that abstract idea.

The vehicle was a 2025 Toyota Sienna Platinum in Wind Chill Pearl.

Production of the Toyota Sienna at the Princeton plant began in 2003, and the plant currently hosts 7,650 employees. The current model is an all-hybrid version.

The vehicle was recently honored in the 2025 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study as the leading model in the minivan segment.

“It’s a significant achievement to reach this milestone and something our team members should be proud of,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Indiana. “The all-hybrid Sienna demonstrates our commitment to electrification and remains a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.”

Sienna is one of many electrified powertrain options at Toyota. In May, sales of the Sienna increased by more than 95% compared to the previous year. Electrified vehicles comprised nearly half of Toyota’s total monthly sales during the same period.

Since its establishment in 1996, Toyota Indiana has received approximately $8 billion in total investment. The plant has contributed over $54 million to local organizations.

“Many people were acting on the assumption that it was going to be the Democrats continuing in power,” she said.
But a dozen other states are signed on to California’s targets, and they have been slower and less generous with incentives and EV charging infrastructure.
California had 12 other states signed on to follow its lead as of last year, but it now has 10, after Republican-led Virginia dropped out and Vermont delayed enforcement by 19 months.
(California and the other 10 states immediately sued Thursday to preserve the emissions standards.)","It’s those same automakers who lobbied Trump to “rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” as Trump put it Thursday.

It didn’t have to get to this point. California officials had been in talks with automakers prior to the November election about how to keep them on board, but the state overplayed its hand, Nichols said.

“Many people were acting on the assumption that it was going to be the Democrats continuing in power,” she said. “So the state felt like they had all the cards in their hand, and then after the election, it was pretty hard to reset the conversation.”

To hear Nichols tell it, California may have gone too far this time in nudging the industry to ever-higher sales of zero-emission vehicles. The rules would have required automakers to hit increasing percentages — 35 percent by model year 2026 and 68 percent by model year 2030 — before reaching 100 percent of new-car sales in 2035.

Maybe that would have worked if it were just about California. But a dozen other states are signed on to California’s targets, and they have been slower and less generous with incentives and EV charging infrastructure. Where California has more than a quarter of its new car sales coming from EVs, New Jersey is at 15 percent, and New York is under 12 percent, according to the industry’s latest figures.

“They were definitely having issues with the California program because they didn’t think they could meet the sales numbers in the mandate, especially [Gov. Gavin] Newsom’s target of nothing but ZEVs with a deadline attached to it,” Nichols said. “That was scary, and even the interim targets were going to be hard to meet.”

The pendulum has swung against California before: The George W. Bush administration was the first to attempt to deny California’s permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to require automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles, and Trump went further in his first term by attempting to revoke the state’s already-issued authority.

But Republicans had never resorted to doing it through Congress, via an untested maneuver that congressional watchdogs have warned is likely illegal but that still drew 35 Democratic votes in the House and one in the Senate (Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), in the tradition of Detroit’s John Dingell).

It’s a far cry from the bipartisan consensus that reigned when President Richard Nixon famously signed the Clean Air Act, which set federal air pollution levels for the first time but gave California permission to continue going further, owing to its decade-plus of vehicle emissions rules aimed at the smoggy Los Angeles basin.

The automakers have been steadily lobbying against the rules since then, with a brief ceasefire from 2009-16, when ten automakers and the United Auto Workers signed a nonaggression pact in President Barack Obama’s Rose Garden with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the EPA.

That it happened at the same time that the federal government was taking an equity stake in General Motors was no coincidence, said Nichols, who helped broker the pact. “They saved them from bankruptcy,” she said.

California has less recourse this time around. Where Newsom signed deals in 2019 with Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, BMW and Volvo to abide by the state’s rules even in the event of federal cancellation, he now only has Stellantis, which signed a separate agreement last year that goes through model year 2030.

And several of the state’s allies are peeling off. California had 12 other states signed on to follow its lead as of last year, but it now has 10, after Republican-led Virginia dropped out and Vermont delayed enforcement by 19 months. And Democrats are getting cold feet, too: Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April delaying enforcement, and Democratic lawmakers in New York introduced a bill this year to delay their participation by two years. (California and the other 10 states immediately sued Thursday to preserve the emissions standards.)

“If it was only California, I think [automakers] wouldn’t have been as eager to jump in on the federal level and work with the Republicans, but it’s the fact it’s the other states that had the California standards that were killing them, especially New York,” Nichols said.",https://static.politico.com/4b/f9/2ee48f70483ba82b7ae0341bc125/trump-03834.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:17.884654

The sector is poised to generate a record level of electricity in 2025, while global investment in nuclear power has increased rapidly over the past four years, with a compound annual growth rate of 14%. That's up from 1% prior to 2020.

The surge is less about meeting climate goals with low-carbon energy sources than about the massive power demands of AI and data centers as the global economy undergoes seismic shifts.

The Nuclear Energy Market's Critical Mass

The nuclear renaissance isn't happening in a vacuum. Data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure that's expected to grow to about 12% by 2028. That expected increase is driven by the growth in AI, which requires enormous amounts of reliable, 24/7 power.

Major tech companies are responding by signing nuclear power purchase agreements. Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (META) recent deal with Constellation Energy for an Illinois nuclear plant follows similar moves by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). (For price and fundamentals on any shares listed on this page, click on their market page.)

These aren't feel-good sustainability gestures, but strategic moves in the AI race. ""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, in a press release.

Core Holdings in Nuclear Energy

Nuclear Stocks

Cameco: The world's second-largest uranium producer offers the most direct exposure to gains from nuclear fuel supplies. In May 2025, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rated Cameco as a ""buy"" with a price target of $65, suggesting an 11% upside. Beyond uranium mining, the company owns a 49% stake in Westinghouse, giving investors exposure to reactor construction as well.

Constellation Energy: The largest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S. that are not rate-regulated. Unlike rate-regulated utilities, where state regulators control profits, Constellation can benefit more responsively from rising electricity prices and growing demand.

GE Vernova (GEV): As a spinoff from General Electric's energy business, Vernova offers exposure to multiple energy technologies.

Nuclear ETFs for Diversified Exposure

Nuclear ETFs provide more diversification than single stocks:

Global X Uranium ETF (URA): With 51 holdings and $3.6 billion in assets under management, it provides ample exposure to uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers, and service providers. Cameco is the fund's largest position, accounting for about a quarter of its holdings.

Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): Focuses specifically on uranium mining companies, with 38 holdings and $1.7 billion in net assets. This fund targets companies dedicating at least 50% of their assets to uranium mining.

The Small Modular Reactor Revolution

Perhaps the biggest gains are to be found in small modular reactors (SMRs). Over 80 SMR designs are in development, with key competitors including NuScale, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (RYCEY), and Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy company that controls over 40% of the global uranium market and 17% of international reactor fuel. These smaller, factory-built reactors promise faster deployment and lower costs than traditional large nuclear plants.

NuScale Power: The only company with SMRs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), giving it a significant first-mover advantage. The company says it expects NRC certification for its higher-output 77-megawatt reactors soon, which would make them cost-competitive with coal-fired plants.

Oklo: Backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, the company said it plans to bring its first reactor online by 2027.

The Half-Life of Nuclear Investments

Nuclear investing isn't without significant risks:

Construction and development risk: Nuclear power plants have the highest construction risk among all energy infrastructure, with average cost overruns of 102.5%. This risk extends to SMR developers, most of whom still need to show they can build and operate their technologies economically.

Highly concentrated supply chain: Uranium production is highly concentrated in four countries, with Kazakhstan accounting for 43%, and enrichment capacities are concentrated in only four suppliers.

Political support: Nuclear projects are subject to extensive regulatory oversight and can be vulnerable to shifting political winds.

The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said.","The multiagency group that coordinates oversight of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System needs an update to better operate in changing conditions, said a federal report released on Thursday.

The Joint Pipeline Office, a consortium of federal and state agencies with various regulatory duties, has scaled back its operations over the past several years, leading to possible gaps in oversight of the system that has delivered North Slope crude oil since 1977, said the report, issued by the Government Accountability Office, an independent nonpartisan agency that conducts audits and investigations for Congress.

To meet current conditions, the joint office should clarify its desired outcomes and resume what was once communication with the public about regulation, enforcement and other issues, the GAO report said.

“Redefining and documenting the intended outcomes of JPO’s oversight activities, including those aiming to inform the public of its oversight efforts, would enable JPO agencies to work toward shared goals and ensure accountability,” the report said. It is important to document the expectations, the report said. “Clarifying roles and responsibilities would enhance coordination among JPO agencies and help JPO identify any potential gaps in oversight.”

The GAO report was requested by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

The JPO, led by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, was established in 1990 in response to the prior year’s Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. The purpose was to better regulate the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which comprises the 800-mile pipeline that carries crude oil from an intake station at Prudhoe Bay and the Valdez Marine Terminal, where the oil is loaded onto tankers.

Other agencies participating in the JPO are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

Much has changed since the JPO’s startup, the GAO report points out.

North Slope oil production has dwindled. Pipeline throughput that averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day in 1990, close to the peak of 2 million barrels a day hit in 1988, is at an average daily flow of 482,495 barrels for the year to date, according to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the system.

Lower oil volume affects Alyeska operations because the oil flowing through the line cools faster, moves slower and drops more solids, leading to more corrosion risks, the report noted.

Permafrost thaw, which undermines infrastructure through much of Alaska, has also affected the system’s integrity and prompted Alyeska to do some special maintenance and protective projects in slumping areas.

Alyeska in the early 2000s launched what it called a “strategic reconfiguration,” later renamed as “electrification and automation,” that increased automation, consolidated facilities — notably for pump stations along the 800-mile line and at the Valdez marine terminal — and relocated workers.

The agencies that are part of the JPO have also changed over time, with shifts in responsibilities and structure.

The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said. But since 2004, there has no longer been a common physical office, and JPO staffing has been reduced. The JPO no longer issues regular activity reports to the public; Its last Comprehensive Monitoring Program report was issued in 2007 and its last annual report in 2005, the GAO report said.

There are now concerns about oversight gaps, particularly at the Valdez terminal. The report cited one example of a troubling incident, the 2022 discovery of vapor leaks at 12 of the thermal’s 14 oil storage tanks. That event led to a report commissioned by the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council that criticized the safety culture at the terminal.

The GAO has issued other reports in the past about TAPS regulation and the JPO. A 1995 report lauded the joint office for improving oversight of the pipeline and terminal.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30 percent of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10 percent each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

Fuel cells vs. batteries

One of the most frequently asked questions in the sustainable transport debate is whether hydrogen fuel cells can outperform traditional lithium-ion batteries. Battery-powered EVs have made significant strides in range, affordability, and infrastructure but still face challenges in long-distance travel and commercial applications due to longer charging times and weight constraints.

FCVs offer faster refuelling, comparable to conventional gasoline vehicles, and a longer range, making them highly suitable for buses, trucks, trains, and even maritime vessels. Fuel cell systems are also less sensitive to temperature variations, providing better performance in extreme weather conditions.

The fuel cell market is leveraging these advantages to position FCVs as a practical alternative for applications where battery technology may fall short. Industry leaders argue that rather than competing, hydrogen fuel cells and batteries can coexist, each serving different niches within the broader clean mobility ecosystem.

The role of policy

Policy frameworks and government incentives play a critical role in accelerating the adoption of fuel cell vehicles. Countries like Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States have introduced national hydrogen strategies aimed at promoting hydrogen infrastructure, R&D, and deployment of FCVs. For instance, South Korea plans to put 6.2 million hydrogen vehicles on the road by 2040 and build 1,200 refuelling stations. The European Union is also investing heavily in the Hydrogen Roadmap Europe, aiming to establish hydrogen as a central component of its decarbonization strategy.

While consumer adoption of fuel cell cars has been gradual, commercial fleets are showing strong interest in the technology. Hydrogen-powered buses, delivery vans, and long-haul trucks are being deployed in several cities worldwide. Companies like Toyota, Hyundai, and Nikola are investing heavily in developing fuel cell trucks, with Toyota’s Mirai and Hyundai’s NEXO among the few FCVs available to the public today.

A future built on innovation and collaboration

The future of the fuel cell vehicle ecosystem depends largely on cross-industry collaboration, government backing, and technological breakthroughs. Advances in hydrogen storage, fuel cell efficiency, and infrastructure development are already underway, and companies are exploring innovative solutions like mobile hydrogen stations and hybrid fuel cell-battery systems to enhance performance and convenience. As costs decline and awareness increases, FCVs are likely to become a more mainstream solution in the global transportation matrix.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/06/14/fuel-cell-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 15:05:18.092103

U.S. consumer sentiment jumped for the first time in monthsAMD is going after NvidiaAmazon and Walmart might get their own cryptocurrencies

The measure from the Environmental Protection Agency would compel refiners to blend biofuels into diesel or gasoline. Those refiners would have to mix about 24.02 million gallons in 2026, a new record. It's a step to discourage foreign imports from reaching the sector.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a release. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

Soybean oil prices jumped after the announcement. It leapt 6.3% during Friday's market trading.

Still, other aspects remained unclear, such as whether small refineries would be exempt from the quotas, given the sheer blending capacity that's necessary to meet the Trump-backed standard. The measure falls under the Renewable Fuel Standard program, which was set up by Congress two decades ago to help boost rural communities.

President Donald Trump's megabill that's currently in the Senate includes a four-year extension of a biofuel tax credit, known as 45Z. But it undoes most other green energy tax credits that were unilaterally approved by Democrats in 2022 under their Inflation Reduction Act.

Katie Hobbs is part of a group warning that the congressional reconciliation bill will harm jobs and investments in Arizona.

The caution comes after the Arizona Commerce Authority’s new figures show the state could lose 69,000 jobs and $58 billion in investments if the bill does away with tax credits from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

Since IRA’s passage, “Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits,” said the Democratic governor in a news release. “These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries.”

Hobbs added that the “federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success” instead of undermining the growth in Arizona.

U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, both Democrats from Arizona, agree with Hobbs.

“We’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits,” said Kelly. “We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.”

Gallego said President Donald Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. But instead, Gallego said, the GOP is cutting jobs and hurting people.

“Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state,” said Danny Seiden, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. “Preserving them is critical to sustaining Arizona’s manufacturing momentum and keeping us at the forefront of next-generation industries.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/a1/9a113f91-667a-4e4d-ba75-07238f8384e8/684ad9eb4aefb.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:56.039266

As Net Zero Investor reported, experts believe it's now a ""buyer's market"" in renewable energy stocks.

Tancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told the publication that stock prices for renewable energy developers are lower than expected, meaning it's an excellent time to invest, as the green energy market is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming years.

While renewable stocks have taken a significant hit due to high interest rates and inflation, experts say the market has reached the end of a downward trend and will soon start to reverse.

Fulop explained that prices for power purchase agreements and construction costs for onshore wind are steady, while solar project costs continue to drop. These factors have contributed to a favorable renewable energy market; however, a drop in interest rates would likely facilitate more development, thereby providing additional opportunities for investors.

Due to uncertainties in the geopolitical outlook over the next several years, Chris Berkouwer, equity portfolio manager at Robeco, told Net Zero Investor that investors should stick with companies that have a proven track record of financial and operational success, rather than taking excessive risks.

Although the clean energy market has experienced fluctuations recently, investing in sustainability-focused companies is a wise decision for the future, as the green energy economy continues to grow rapidly.

According to Statista, the renewable energy market is expected to reach over $2 trillion by 2030, with the International Energy Agency predicting that global renewable electricity generation will ""be enough to meet the combined power demand of China and the United States"" by then.

The expansion of renewable energy is also spurring massive growth in clean energy jobs. A Department of Energy report found that green careers are growing at a rate more than twice that of overall employment in the U.S.

As more clean energy comes online, it will not only benefit the economy but also the planet by replacing the dirty fuels that are contributing to rising global temperatures and more extreme weather.

Because of the positive developments in green stocks, Berkouwer told Net Zero Investor that ""expectations have been reset"" and the ""hunting ground for climate transition investors looks attractive once again.""

Despite the declining share of coal in China's power generation since 2007, the expansion of renewables has not kept pace with electricity demand, meaning renewables supplement rather than replace coal-fired generation.
From 2020 to 2024, electricity demand in China grew faster than GDP — averaging 7% against GDP growth of around 5%.
Between 2021 and 2024, coal still comprised 55%–61% of total electricity generation.
Direct local supply of green electricity—such as building renewables near industrial zones or large-scale rooftop solar—is also expanding rapidly.","China accounted for more than half of global growth in electricity demand in 2023, mainly due to its industrial sector, which represents approximately 60% of national electricity consumption. A significant share of this growth is being driven by the production of the ""new three"" industries—solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs)—which together contributed about one-third of the industrial demand increase. In coming years, additional demand is anticipated from increased air-conditioner adoption, EV charging, rapid growth in data centers, and the expansion of 5G infrastructure [para. 1][para. 2].

Despite the declining share of coal in China's power generation since 2007, the expansion of renewables has not kept pace with electricity demand, meaning renewables supplement rather than replace coal-fired generation. In response, China has introduced policies requiring energy-intensive sectors to source a portion of their power from renewables, as a way to encourage compliance and engagement with greener power use [para. 3][para. 4].

From 2020 to 2024, electricity demand in China grew faster than GDP — averaging 7% against GDP growth of around 5%. Notably, manufacturing of EVs, PV modules, and batteries saw output rise ninefold, fourfold, and twelvefold respectively over this period, while general industrial output increased by only 24%. By comparison, traditional heavy industry segments (like steel and cement) grew much less or even contracted. Industrial demand was also spurred by burgeoning infrastructure such as AI data centers, with electricity use in internet-related services jumping 31% in 2024, and EV charging/switching services rising 51%. Projections suggest that by 2030, data centers alone could account for nearly 6% of China's electricity usage [para. 5][para. 6][para. 7][para. 8][para. 9].

However, coal-fired power remains dominant, supported by concerns over economic efficiency and grid security. Between 2021 and 2024, coal still comprised 55%–61% of total electricity generation. In 2024, coal accounted for 54.8% of generation, and renewables about 35%. Notwithstanding record renewables expansion—356 GW of wind and solar installed (equivalent to the entire US wind and solar capacity)—coal capacity also grew, with 94.5 GW of new projects started and total approvals reaching 66.7 GW in 2024, the most since 2015. While renewables’ share in the mix is up 15 percentage points since 2014, coal has fallen 16. The IEA projects coal’s share will decrease to 50% by 2027, with fossil fuels increasingly acting as backup as variable renewables are integrated [para. 10][para. 11][para. 12][para. 13][para. 14][para. 15][para. 16][para. 17][para. 18][para. 19][para. 20][para. 21][para. 22][para. 23].

To encourage renewable adoption, China uses Green Electricity Certificates (GECs), which companies can purchase to claim use of green energy. From March 2024, companies in heavy industries are required to use renewable electricity for a set percentage of total consumption, matching national averages by 2030. Currently, provincial targets are around 35% (20% excluding hydropower), and there is an oversupply of GECs due to a lack of firm sectoral mandates [para. 24][para. 25][para. 26][para. 27][para. 28][para. 29].

Direct local supply of green electricity—such as building renewables near industrial zones or large-scale rooftop solar—is also expanding rapidly. Incentives include zero-cost installation and discounts; for example, distributed (mainly rooftop) PV capacity reached 370 GW (42% of national installed PV capacity) by the end of 2024, up 121 times from 2013. Some industrial users, such as parts suppliers for German automakers, are contractually obligated to use 100% renewables for production and supplement local supply with purchased certificates. Such practices highlight China’s move toward locally sourced and direct supply of renewable power as both policy and economics drive further green transformation [para. 30][para. 31][para. 32][para. 33][para. 34][para. 35][para. 36][para. 37][para. 38][para. 39][para. 40][para. 41][para. 42].

Studies along these lines, using remote control of air conditioners to support the grid, have for many years explored theoretical possibilities like this.
The benefits include increasing the reliability of the power grid, which makes it easier for the grid to accept more renewable energy.
Our goal is to turn air conditioners from a challenge for the power grid into an asset, supporting a shift away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy.
The way power plants know what real-time power adjustments are needed is by closely monitoring the grid frequency.","As summer arrives, people are turning on air conditioners in most of the U.S. But if you’re like me, you always feel a little guilty about that. Past generations managed without air conditioning – do I really need it? And how bad is it to use all this electricity for cooling in a warming world?

If I leave my air conditioner off, I get too hot. But if everyone turns on their air conditioner at the same time, electricity demand spikes, which can force power grid operators to activate some of the most expensive, and dirtiest, power plants. Sometimes those spikes can ask too much of the grid and lead to brownouts or blackouts.

Research I recently published with a team of scholars makes me feel a little better, though. We have found that it is possible to coordinate the operation of large numbers of home air-conditioning units, balancing supply and demand on the power grid – and without making people endure high temperatures inside their homes.

Studies along these lines, using remote control of air conditioners to support the grid, have for many years explored theoretical possibilities like this. However, few approaches have been demonstrated in practice and never for such a high-value application and at this scale. The system we developed not only demonstrated the ability to balance the grid on timescales of seconds, but also proved it was possible to do so without affecting residents’ comfort.

The benefits include increasing the reliability of the power grid, which makes it easier for the grid to accept more renewable energy. Our goal is to turn air conditioners from a challenge for the power grid into an asset, supporting a shift away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy.

Adjustable equipment

My research focuses on batteries, solar panels and electric equipment – such as electric vehicles, water heaters, air conditioners and heat pumps – that can adjust itself to consume different amounts of energy at different times.

Originally, the U.S. electric grid was built to transport electricity from large power plants to customers’ homes and businesses. And originally, power plants were large, centralized operations that burned coal or natural gas, or harvested energy from nuclear reactions. These plants were typically always available and could adjust how much power they generated in response to customer demand, so the grid would be balanced between power coming in from producers and being used by consumers.

But the grid has changed. There are more renewable energy sources, from which power isn’t always available – like solar panels at night or wind turbines on calm days. And there are the devices and equipment I study. These newer options, called “distributed energy resources,” generate or store energy near where consumers need it – or adjust how much energy they’re using in real time.

One aspect of the grid hasn’t changed, though: There’s not much storage built into the system. So every time you turn on a light, for a moment there’s not enough electricity to supply everything that wants it right then: The grid needs a power producer to generate a little more power. And when you turn off a light, there’s a little too much: A power producer needs to ramp down.

The way power plants know what real-time power adjustments are needed is by closely monitoring the grid frequency. The goal is to provide electricity at a constant frequency – 60 hertz – at all times. If more power is needed than is being produced, the frequency drops and a power plant boosts output. If there’s too much power being produced, the frequency rises and a power plant slows production a little. These actions, a process called “frequency regulation,” happen in a matter of seconds to keep the grid balanced.

This output flexibility, primarily from power plants, is key to keeping the lights on for everyone.

Finding new options

I’m interested in how distributed energy resources can improve flexibility in the grid. They can release more energy, or consume less, to respond to the changing supply or demand, and help balance the grid, ensuring the frequency remains near 60 hertz.

Some people fear that doing so might be invasive, giving someone outside your home the ability to control your battery or air conditioner. Therefore, we wanted to see if we could help balance the grid with frequency regulation using home air-conditioning units rather than power plants – without affecting how residents use their appliances or how comfortable they are in their homes.

From 2019 to 2023, my group at the University of Michigan tried this approach, in collaboration with researchers at Pecan Street Inc., Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.

We recruited 100 homeowners in Austin, Texas, to do a real-world test of our system. All the homes had whole-house forced-air cooling systems, which we connected to custom control boards and sensors the owners allowed us to install in their homes. This equipment let us send instructions to the air-conditioning units based on the frequency of the grid.

Before I explain how the system worked, I first need to explain how thermostats work. When people set thermostats, they pick a temperature, and the thermostat switches the air-conditioning compressor on and off to maintain the air temperature within a small range around that set point. If the temperature is set at 68 degrees, the thermostat turns the AC on when the temperature is, say, 70, and turns it off when it’s cooled down to, say, 66.

Every few seconds, our system slightly changed the timing of air-conditioning compressor switching for some of the 100 air conditioners, causing the units’ aggregate power consumption to change. In this way, our small group of home air conditioners reacted to grid changes the way a power plant would – using more or less energy to balance the grid and keep the frequency near 60 hertz.

Moreover, our system was designed to keep home temperatures within the same small temperature range around the set point.

Testing the approach

We ran our system in four tests, each lasting one hour. We found two encouraging results.

First, the air conditioners were able to provide frequency regulation at least as accurately as a traditional power plant. Therefore, we showed that air conditioners could play a significant role in increasing grid flexibility. But perhaps more importantly – at least in terms of encouraging people to participate in these types of systems – we found that we were able to do so without affecting people’s comfort in their homes.

We found that home temperatures did not deviate more than 1.6 Fahrenheit from their set point. Homeowners were allowed to override the controls if they got uncomfortable, but most didn’t. For most tests, we received zero override requests. In the worst case, we received override requests from two of the 100 homes in our test.

In practice, this sort of technology could be added to commercially available internet-connected thermostats. In exchange for credits on their energy bills, users could choose to join a service run by the thermostat company, their utility provider or some other third party.

Then people could turn on the air conditioning in the summer heat without that pang of guilt, knowing they were helping to make the grid more reliable and more capable of accommodating renewable energy sources – without sacrificing their own comfort in the process.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/air-conditioner-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:07:39.254316

The removal of the requirement for the traditional UPS infrastructure can significantly change how data center energy issues are addressed. According to Pasi Taimela, Chief Innovation Officer of FlexGen:

Partnership Benefits

By the end of 2024, over 6400 MW of new data center capacity was under construction, just in the US, and with the growth of AI and HPC workloads, global demand could double by 2028, potentially reaching 325–580 TWh annually.

Yet these facilities face increasing stress on grid capacity, long interconnection queues, and rising ESG expectations. And regardless of the stress level, reliability is non-negotiable. Even seconds of downtime cost $100k–500k/hour.

Tier 0 power security hinges on instantaneous, high‑quality backup—typically via UPS and diesel generators, which are increasingly seen as outdated, noisy, polluting, and too slow for evolving demands.

As local communities begin to legislate controls over data center development, the traditional backup power system, primarily diesel generation, is squarely in their sights as something that requires external controls.

One of the goals of this product partnership is to help define new architecture templates, procurement guidelines, and deployment strategies for BESS as UPS replacements, setting benchmarks for future deployments and potential long-term positive impact on data center targets for net-zero growth.

Why this BESS?

This partnership marks the first utility-scale BESS deployment explicitly designed to replace UPS for data centers. By placing the BESS outside the facility at medium voltage, it changes the perspective, circumventing the complexity and cost of indoor power system rewiring.

The system integrates Rosendin’s patented BESSUPS and FlexGen’s Soft-Grid Interconnect & Island-Grid Frequency Stabilization technologies. The goal is to enable deployment without costly electrical redesign inside the data facility.

The system delivers a utility-scale, medium-voltage system providing high-density, high-quality power sufficient for mission-critical data center loads. Overall, the solution is managed by FlexGen’s HybridOS energy management software, enabling real-time monitoring, intelligent dispatch, and precise transitions between operating modes.

BESS Is the Best (for AI)

This system, deployed outside the data center, on the medium-voltage side, can eliminate complex indoor UPS systems. This not only reduces capex, but also simplifies design, reduces fire and acoustic risks, and improves modularity.

It is also designed to accommodate the energy demands of fast-shifting workloads, such as AI training and HPC, that can quickly scale to tax the limits of existing power infrastructure already installed in existing data centers.

This BESS system is designed to support bi-directional dispatch, enabling data centers to act as virtual power plants by feeding power back during peak demand or grid instability. Selling power back to the grid, supporting utility services, and providing fast frequency response, even while continuing to act as a UPS, transforms the data center into a grid asset, not just a load.

With more locations requiring data center deployments to work with the existing utility grid, this capability is one that can help assure project approval and data center deployment.

Sustainability Cred

To further enhance sustainability and the drive toward net-zero, the BESS reduces dependency on backup diesel power generation and makes for a cleaner grid profile.

The BESS system itself delivers CEBMA-level power quality at scale, meeting Continuous, Evolvable, Black‑Start, Micrologic Aligned (CEBMA) standards, delivering clean, uninterrupted, high-performance power crucial for mission-critical data center, without onsite generators.

According to a FlexGen press release, real world, grid-connected validation is in process with the partners conducting live field tests to demonstrate:

· Existing grid-forming PCS technologies supporting waveforms and response.

PCS firmware upgrades enabling full UPS replacement.

Seamless switching between grid-connected and island mode.

This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.
Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, commented, “Achieving OMC status is a pivotal moment for TruAlt.
This creates value at the grassroots level while supporting the clean energy transition through solutions like ethanol and Bio-CNG.
This development coincides with a period of transformation in India’s fuel economy.","In a major step for India’s energy transition, TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, the nation’s leading ethanol producer and a top integrated biofuels company, has received official authorization as an Oil Marketing Company (OMC). This approval enables TruAlt to directly distribute clean fuels like ethanol and Bio-CNG, as well as market traditional fuels such as petrol and diesel throughout India, marking its significant entry into the fuel retail industry.

TruAlt becomes one of the first private biofuel firms in India to be granted this status, joining a select group licensed to market and retail petroleum products across the country. This achievement reinforces the company’s manufacturing capabilities and its leadership in advancing India’s clean energy future. It also allows TruAlt to provide a smooth retail experience, combining both biofuels and conventional fuels under one roof.

The timing of TruAlt’s foray into retailing is both strategic and transformative. With its strong foundations in ethanol and Bio-CNG production, the company aims to offer a distinctive retail model that combines traditional and renewable fuels, including petrol, diesel, E93, Bio-CNG, along with EV charging points and battery swapping services. This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.

As part of its OMC authorisation, TruAlt is committed to improving fuel access in underserved areas, planning to establish at least 5% of its outlets in remote regions as part of its contribution to the government’s last-mile connectivity initiative. In the initial phase, the company plans to roll out over 100 fuel stations in key areas of Karnataka and Maharashtra, creating a strong network that serves both conventional and next-generation blended fuels, such as ethanol and Bio-CNG. This expansion is set to generate over 2,000 jobs across urban and rural areas, driving local economies and supporting the broader energy transition.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?
There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid.
Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.
But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully.","Lucid Group (LCID -2.78%) is growing its electric vehicle (EV) sales rapidly right now. In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/821167/gettyimages-1330888912-1201x655-4b46871-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:06:36.952385

The patent describes a layered electrode structure that improves ionic conductivity and energy density—two critical barriers to commercialising this next-generation battery technology.

The core of the design integrates a current collector with multiple electrode material layers composed of active materials, conductive agents, binders, and a solid electrolyte made of polymers and metal salts. The electrolyte penetrates the electrode layer along its thickness, shortening ion transport paths and enhancing performance. Xiaomi also notes that this approach is compatible with existing lithium battery manufacturing lines, potentially easing future mass production.

Xiaomi claims its prototype supports a Cell-to-Body (CTB) design with a 77.8% volume efficiency. The battery pack, measuring only 120 mm in height, including the vehicle floor, offers better space utilisation and improved weight distribution. Claimed figures include a CLTC-rated range exceeding 1,200 km and a fast-charging capability of 800 km in 10 minutes.

This development aligns with a broader industry push toward solid-state batteries. Global players, including CATL, BYD, Toyota, SAIC, and BMW, are advancing similar technologies. BMW has begun road testing a prototype i7, while CATL and SAIC target small-scale production by 2027. Toyota also aims to launch its first solid-state battery models between 2027 and 2028.

Solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolyte in conventional lithium-ion cells with solid materials, promising improvements in energy density, safety, and thermal stability. However, significant hurdles persist, such as limited ionic conductivity, interfacial contact issues, and lithium dendrite formation. Three types of solid electrolytes—sulfide, oxide, and polymer—are being explored, each with conductivity, stability, and manufacturability trade-offs.

Xiaomi’s patent indicates progress in addressing ion transport challenges within thick electrodes, a key bottleneck in fast-charging applications. Analysts suggest this could give Xiaomi a path toward integrating in-house solid-state batteries into future EVs, such as a successor to the SU7, reducing reliance on third-party suppliers like CATL and BYD.

While widespread adoption is unlikely before 2030, Xiaomi’s entry signals growing momentum. With increasing investment from automakers and battery firms, solid-state batteries are inching closer to commercial reality.",https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/xiaomi-su7-gt-3-large-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:06:41.068636

What is Battery Rebalancing?

Patent Applications

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' first patent application, method and system for battery pack adjustment, introduces a novel solution to address the common issue of imbalanced battery cells within a battery pack - an issue that leads to reduced capacity, safety concerns, and shortened lifespan. In most battery packs, cells charge and discharge at different rates due to variations in manufacturing, internal resistance, and temperature, which causes some cells to reach full charge or depletion before others. As a result, traditional battery management systems (BMS) cut off charging or discharging based on the weakest cell, wasting the remaining potential of other cells. This invention solves that problem through a smart system that continuously monitors and adjusts the state of charge (SOC) of each group of cells (referred to as ""strings""). The system includes a display controller (which manages operations), a charger and discharger (handling overall energy flow), and an equalizer (which precisely adjusts each string). By allocating charge and discharge intelligently across the cells, the system ensures they all reach full capacity and deplete evenly, thereby maximizing usable energy, detecting early signs of degradation, enhancing safety, and extending the overall life of the battery pack.

The second patent application, for two-wire charging and remote voltage detection, presents a streamlined method to charge a battery and measure its voltage using only two wires-significantly reducing system complexity and hardware costs. In conventional battery systems, separate wires or sensors are typically required to monitor voltage during charging, which adds material costs and design challenges, especially in large-scale applications like electric vehicles or grid storage. This invention enables both functions over the same wire pair by briefly pausing the charge current, opening a switch, and using that moment to measure the battery's voltage through the same lines. A pulse isolation drive circuit is used to manage this operation safely and reliably, even when voltage levels are floating or unstable. The result is a simplified yet highly accurate system that maintains the integrity of voltage readings while eliminating the need for redundant hardware. This two-wire approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern battery systems that demand reliability, safety, and scalability.

News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' next-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine achieves 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity in a Nissan Leaf and recovers 37.7% of Rated Capacity in a severely imbalanced Class 3 commercial EV battery pack.

Trial results confirm the real-world effectiveness of innovations covered in the Company's provisional patent applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), validating both hardware and software components of its next-generation rebalancing platform.

Ongoing validation efforts span additional EV battery platforms, supporting full utility patent filings and positioning Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in the EV battery reconditioning and lifespan extension market.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W) (""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated April 11, 2025-wherein the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies"") submitted provisional patent applications (the ""Patent Applications"") with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"") for its next-generation battery rebalancing hardware and software platform-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has now successfully validated the core innovations described in the filings through multiple real-world preliminary trials (the ""Preliminary Trials"").

In a Preliminary Trial disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies tested its second-generation, patent-pending rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") on a 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack (the ""Nissan Battery Pack""), representative of the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States. The Nissan Battery Pack exhibited minor voltage imbalances typical of real-world use. Prototype 2.0 successfully rebalanced all 96 cells to 4.20 volts - the commonly recognized full charge state in the industry1 - achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity and restoring 1.95 ampere-hours, representing a 3.9% increase in usable capacity. The trial demonstrated the precision of Prototype 2.0 in restoring performance even on a relatively well-balanced battery pack, and supported its scalability across high-volume electric vehicle (EV) battery platforms.

In a subsequent Preliminary Trial, as disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025, Prototype 2.0 was tested on a significantly imbalanced 144-cell battery pack from a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""). The Preliminary Trial was conducted on a battery pack exhibiting significant real-world imbalance and resulted in the recovery of 66.3 ampere-hours, representing a 37.7% recovery of the Rated Capacity, and 100% recovery of imbalance-induced capacity loss. The Electric Truck Preliminary Trial demonstrated the robustness of the technology under more demanding conditions and expanded Prototype 2.0's proven applicability to commercial vehicle platforms.

""The trials are confirming exactly what we filed with the USPTO,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""To see both passenger and commercial electric vehicle battery platforms respond with full imbalance-related capacity recovery proves our technological innovations work-and it works where it matters most: in real-world environments with real-world degradation caused by battery cell imbalance.""

Prototype 2.0

Together, these initiatives underscore Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' commitment to demonstrating the adaptability, precision, and commercial readiness of its rebalancing platform across a wide range of EV battery platforms. By validating performance on both passenger and commercial electric vehicles - with varying chemistries, architectures, and states of degradation - Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is building the foundation for broad-based adoption. These efforts reinforce its mission to deliver a scalable, software- and hardware-enabled solution capable of correcting imbalance-related degradation that affects millions of lithium-ion battery packs worldwide.

Importantly, the Preliminary Trial results not only validate the technical functionality of Prototype 2.0, but also demonstrate its ability to recover substantial usable capacity otherwise lost to cell-level imbalance. This has clear implications for extending driving range, improving battery health, and reducing lifecycle costs for electric vehicle owners. The significance is amplified in the case of the Electric Truck, where nearly 40% of the pack's Rated Capacity was recovered, reinforcing Prototype 2.0's relevance in fleet and commercial contexts where battery degradation can severely impact performance, uptime, and asset value. The results support a broader opportunity to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in battery lifespan extension and reconditioning, targeting the rapidly growing segment of electric vehicles anticipated to fall outside of their manufacturer's warranty, which is estimated to be nearly 40 million vehicles worldwide by 20312,3.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to continue its validation phase, which includes additional testing on a range of electric vehicle battery platforms and high-volume vehicle models. These efforts are designed to support the Company's progression from provisional to full utility patent applications, while also verifying system compatibility across multiple lithium-ion chemistries and configurations. This ongoing validation will play a critical role in expanding market readiness and demonstrating the commercial potential of Prototype 2.0 across both private and fleet-based EV markets.

This milestone strengthens Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' strategic position as a first mover in the emerging EV battery rebalancing market, with a focus on extending battery life, reducing waste, and improving performance for electric vehicle owners and fleet operators.

The Patent Applications represent the culmination of multiple years of development, validation, and innovation by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies and mark a significant milestone toward solidifying its position in the lithium-ion and EV battery rebalancing and lifespan extension market. The company's next-generation rebalancing technology - validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), as further described below-reinforces its commitment to delivering real-world solutions that support battery longevity and sustainability.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20234. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units5, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage6,7. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements8. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the NRC, focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced - one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC - resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

As disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 2, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies completed Prototype 2.0, the second-generation version of its patent-pending lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine. This advanced prototype incorporates significant refinements and updates over the original, including modified dimensions, optimized weight, and a full suite of accompanying equipment. Designed to reflect real-world use and commercial deployment readiness, Prototype 2.0 includes the core rebalancing system as well as a multi-function battery diagnostic device, system interface tablets, a battery pack lift, and insulated tool kits to support safe and effective field operations.

What is Battery Rebalancing?

Patent Applications

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' first patent application, method and system for battery pack adjustment, introduces a novel solution to address the common issue of imbalanced battery cells within a battery pack - an issue that leads to reduced capacity, safety concerns, and shortened lifespan. In most battery packs, cells charge and discharge at different rates due to variations in manufacturing, internal resistance, and temperature, which causes some cells to reach full charge or depletion before others. As a result, traditional battery management systems (BMS) cut off charging or discharging based on the weakest cell, wasting the remaining potential of other cells. This invention solves that problem through a smart system that continuously monitors and adjusts the state of charge (SOC) of each group of cells (referred to as ""strings""). The system includes a display controller (which manages operations), a charger and discharger (handling overall energy flow), and an equalizer (which precisely adjusts each string). By allocating charge and discharge intelligently across the cells, the system ensures they all reach full capacity and deplete evenly, thereby maximizing usable energy, detecting early signs of degradation, enhancing safety, and extending the overall life of the battery pack.

The second patent application, for two-wire charging and remote voltage detection, presents a streamlined method to charge a battery and measure its voltage using only two wires-significantly reducing system complexity and hardware costs. In conventional battery systems, separate wires or sensors are typically required to monitor voltage during charging, which adds material costs and design challenges, especially in large-scale applications like electric vehicles or grid storage. This invention enables both functions over the same wire pair by briefly pausing the charge current, opening a switch, and using that moment to measure the battery's voltage through the same lines. A pulse isolation drive circuit is used to manage this operation safely and reliably, even when voltage levels are floating or unstable. The result is a simplified yet highly accurate system that maintains the integrity of voltage readings while eliminating the need for redundant hardware. This two-wire approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern battery systems that demand reliability, safety, and scalability.

Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the US and to support American jobs.","It's no secret that every automaker is currently scrambling to adjust its production output and sales forecast in response to the new US tariffs on vehicle and parts imports. Some companies have already decided to raise prices, some have shifted production allocation away from other North American markets to keep cars within the US, and some are still negotiating to work out their own trade deal, like the Japanese bloc of carmakers. Today, General Motors has reacted, in part, by announcing a fresh investment of nearly $4 billion into US manufacturing for next-gen vehicles over the next two years, including the hotly anticipated and hopefully affordable 2027 Chevy Bolt EV comeback.

Bolting Back

The Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV went out of production by December 2023 at the GM Fairfax plant in Kansas, which is now retooling for the expected return of the Bolt model for the 2027 model year. Chevrolet says that next-gen Bolt production could start as early as the end of this year. The Fairfax plant is said to build ""next-generation affordable EVs,"" but it's not clear if that means more models than the Bolt, or if GM is planning to do a Bolt EV hatch and EUV crossover duo again.

We'll see soon enough, it sounds like. The GM Fairfax assembly plant will also begin building the gas-powered Equinox SUV starting in 2027, which will also be built in Mexico, likely localized to each market and not for cross-border sales.

Other Production Shifts

GM has already announced that it would scale back full-size truck production in Canada and scale it up at its Fort Wayne, Indiana plant instead. GM’s Spring Hill, which currently builds the Cadillac XT5 and Cadillac Lyriq and Cadillac Vistiq EVs, will get a next-gen gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer SUV in 2027. Gas-powered Blazer production is then expected to cease at GM's Ramos Arizpe, Mexico facility, which will continue to build gas-powered Equinox SUVs for non-US markets.

The GM Orion Assembly plant in Michigan has been offline for retooling since 2023, has swapped initial plans to build new EV trucks, and instead will churn out full-size gas SUVs and trucks by early 2027. EV models will continue to be assembled in the Factory Zero plant in Michigan; those models include the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Hummer EV, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ electric SUV.

“Today’s news goes well beyond the investment numbers — this is about hardworking Americans making vehicles they are proud to build and that customers are proud to own,"" GM President Mark Reuss said. “As you travel the country, you can see firsthand the scale of our manufacturing footprint and the positive economic impact on our communities and our country.”

GM CEO Mary Barra added: “We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise.

Experts say the spike is being fueled by rising costs linked to tariffs, especially on imported components and finished goods often used in appliance manufacturing.
What’s behind the spike in appliance prices?
The backstory: Major appliances—such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens—often include components made overseas, even if they’re assembled in the U.S.
The latest inflation data shows appliance prices were up even more than most other consumer goods.","After two years of falling prices, appliances are suddenly getting more expensive—and trade policy may be the reason.

According to the latest Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of major household appliances jumped 4.3% in May compared to April. That’s the sharpest month-over-month increase in over a year, and a major reversal after a period of steady deflation in 2023 and 2024.

Experts say the spike is being fueled by rising costs linked to tariffs, especially on imported components and finished goods often used in appliance manufacturing.

What’s behind the spike in appliance prices?

The backstory:

Major appliances—such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens—often include components made overseas, even if they’re assembled in the U.S. When tariffs are placed on imported goods, those costs are passed along to manufacturers, and increasingly, to shoppers.

""Refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines are particularly vulnerable because they often include a high percentage of foreign components—even when final assembly happens in the U.S.,"" David Warrick, executive vice president at supply chain platform Overhaul, told CNET.

The latest inflation data shows appliance prices were up even more than most other consumer goods. In April, only newspapers and magazines saw a bigger monthly jump.

How are companies and consumers responding?

What they're saying:

Some manufacturers are already preparing to raise prices further. In April, appliance giant LG told Reuters it was considering price increases on certain U.S. products.

That announcement has some consumers rushing to buy before prices climb again. ""We’re going to maybe see another 10% price increase come June,"" said Joseph Legato, CEO of Bill & Rod’s Appliance in Livonia, Michigan, in an interview with WXYZ Detroit. ""What we are recommending is make sure people take advantage of the promotional times that are coming up.""

Could prices rise even more this summer?

What's next:

The U.S. Department of Energy announced in February that it would delay some energy-efficiency requirements for washers and dryers in an attempt to lower costs, but analysts say tariffs will likely continue putting upward pressure on prices—especially as trade policies evolve.

Trump-era tariff frameworks remain politically influential, and if reinstated or expanded in a future administration, could further affect consumer prices for imported goods and U.S.-assembled products with foreign materials.

Retailers warn that shoppers may want to lock in current promotions now, especially for big-ticket appliances that are already trending upward in cost.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/06/1280/720/gettyimages-2207834509.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-06-14 16:07:00.988874

EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 – a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.
It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons.
Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.
The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.","New York — President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation’s fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 – a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency’s proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2025 traded as high as $1.06 each on Friday, up from 88 cents the previous session, traders said.

Biomass-based (D4) credits traded as much as $1.17 each, versus between $1.05 and $1.01 the previous session, traders said.

The oil and biofuel industries, both powerful lobbies in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration’s support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA’s previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

Biofuel advocates cheered the proposal.

“USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American-grown biofuels,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins.

“The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers,” said Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper.

Though GM continues to assert its belief in an “all-EV future,” the new investment signals a recalibration in response to changing political, economic, and consumer dynamics.
Still, analysts suggest the 2035 pledge was more symbolic than practical.
In another telling sign, GM recently cancelled plans to produce electric motors in Buffalo, New York, redirecting nearly $900 million into V-8 engine production instead.
“Given the current market and regulatory climate,” Abuelsamid concluded, “GM’s pivot is not surprising – it was always a long shot.”","General Motors (GM) has taken a major step back from its once-bold pledge to sell only electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035, opting instead for a more balanced production strategy. The Detroit automaker revealed this week that it will invest $4 billion in expanding production of petrol-powered vehicles, a move industry analysts see as effectively shelving the original EV-only ambition.

Though GM continues to assert its belief in an “all-EV future,” the new investment signals a recalibration in response to changing political, economic, and consumer dynamics. “They’re not abandoning EVs, but this investment shows they no longer see 2035 as a realistic target,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an auto analyst at Detroit-based research firm Telemetry told Politico.

GM’s revised strategy reflects broader challenges in the EV sector. Since the company unveiled its goal in 2021, momentum has slowed. The initial optimism under the Biden administration, which introduced EV incentives and green infrastructure plans, has given way to a more conservative stance under President Trump. Federal support for EVs has been reduced, new tariffs have been introduced, and public enthusiasm has cooled, prompting automakers to hedge their bets.

Despite the strategic pivot, GM reported 37,000 EVs sold in Q1 2025, securing its position as the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. Still, analysts suggest the 2035 pledge was more symbolic than practical. “It was always aspirational,” said independent analyst Alan Baum. “They’ve outperformed many competitors, but policy gaps and market reluctance are limiting growth.”

GM’s current restructuring includes relocating production of petrol vehicles from Mexico to U.S. plants to dodge new tariffs. The company’s Orion plant in Michigan will now handle full-size SUV and pickup production, while the Equinox will shift to Fairfax, Kansas, and the Blazer to Spring Hill, Tennessee.

Meanwhile, EV manufacturing will continue at Factory Zero in Detroit, though it is operating below capacity. That plant will produce electric Silverados, Sierras, Escalades, and the Hummer EV. The upcoming Chevrolet Bolt reboot will be built in Fairfax.

In an op-ed in the USA Today News Network this week, former Board of Public Utilities Commissioner Mary-Anna Holden said the energy policies of the Murphy administration, which primarily removed natural gas and nuclear as sources before the advance of solar and wind effectively drove up costs because New Jersey was at a stark energy imbalance of supply and demand.

“The truth is that this state’s energy policy has gone off the rails,” Holden wrote. “I’ve seen good intentions turn into costly failures when they lack fact-based planning.

“Instead of chasing artificial deadlines and politically popular incentives, our leaders should be focused on real-world physics and economics.

“This means revisiting the Energy Master Plan, rethinking electrification mandates and supporting a balanced generation mix that includes reliable, low-emission sources like natural gas and nuclear while continuing to develop meaningful renewables at a pace our infrastructure can handle.”

New Jersey, under the governor’s Energy Master Plan, set a target to achieve 100% clean energy by 2035 mostly through offshore wind, solar expansion and other energy efficiency programs.

When the plan was introduced five years ago, NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor predicted the current supply and demand challenges and energy cost spikes currently taking place.

Said Cantor: “From the day the EMP was announced, we have continuously warned that creating policies that set artificial deadlines for actions and discouraging new generation from sources that include natural gas and nuclear will result in much higher energy prices for our residents and businesses. And here we are.

As a major greenfield facility focused on refractories and steel casting fluxes, the CAPES project is setting new benchmarks for sustainable industrial development in East and South India.

Designed as a next-generation manufacturing hub, the CAPES plant integrates eco-conscious practices from the ground up—going well beyond regulatory compliance to drive long-term environmental stewardship.

Powering Up with Clean Energy

The CAPES plant is taking definitive steps toward energy sustainability, beginning with a plan to source 20% of its energy from solar power within five years. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions but also reflects Calderys’ alignment with India’s broader push for renewable energy integration in manufacturing.

Zero Discharge, Maximum Water Efficiency

One of CAPES’ standout features is its zero effluent discharge design. Through advanced on-site effluent and sewage treatment systems, all wastewater is treated and reused for landscaping and auxiliary functions. To further support aquifer sustainability, Calderys will install 95 groundwater recharge pits. This initiative ensures long-term water conservation and promotes responsible usage within the industrial ecosystem.

Green Belt Development: 800 Trees and Counting

In line with its commitment to biodiversity and carbon offsetting, Calderys has launched an ambitious green belt development initiative on-site. The company has already planted 800 of the planned 2,000 trees, with the goal of developing 33% green cover within the facility. This will significantly enhance the microclimate and contribute to a more resilient industrial environment.

Cleaner Air Through Advanced Filtration

Calderys is also tackling air quality head-on. The plant features a state-of-the-art dust and emission control system, designed to make the air up to five times cleaner than traditional refractory manufacturing sites. High-efficiency filtration technologies sharply reduce particulate emissions, protecting both workers and the surrounding community.

Embracing Circular Economy Principles

At CAPES, sustainability is circular. The plant actively incorporates scrap and recycled materials into its production cycles, effectively minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency. This approach reduces environmental impact and contributes to a closed-loop manufacturing model that supports Calderys’ global sustainability goals.

Leadership Perspective: Building for the Future

Ish Mohan Garg, Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific, stated, “At Calderys, sustainability is not a standalone initiative—it’s embedded into every aspect of our operations. The CAPES plant in Odisha reflects our vision of future-ready manufacturing, where innovation and responsibility go hand-in-hand. Our environmental measures are a commitment not just to the planet, but also to the communities and generations we serve, and they support India’s national decarbonization goals.”

A Model for Sustainable Industrial Growth

Through its efforts at the CAPES facility, Calderys is developing more than just a modern manufacturing site. It is pioneering a new standard for environmentally responsible growth. As per the press release, the company’s approach aligns with India’s national sustainability goals. It also supports the global push for a cleaner, smarter, and more accountable industry.",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Calderys-Sets-Sustainability-Milestone-in-Odisha-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:09:37.457859

However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work.
Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA.
Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases.","CHARLESTON – A former state senator who previously led West Virginia’s economic development initiatives is urging President Donald Trump and Congress to keep in place energy tax credits, while U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito believes that some of those credits need to be reviewed or repealed.

Mitch Carmichael, a former member of the House of Delegates and state Senate, is the leader of Built for America, a new advocacy organization, urging the Trump administration to not roll back energy tax credits.

Carmichael served as state Senate president and lieutenant governor from 2017 to the end of 2020, then served under former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., as the first secretary of the new Department of Economic Development until the fall of 2024.

During his tenure as a cabinet secretary, Carmichael oversaw the recruitment of several major manufacturers to the state, including the Form Energy grid battery project in Weirton, and the Berkshire Hathaway/Timet titanium melt facility near Ravenswood that will be powered by a solar energy microgrid. Carmichael also serves as a senior advisor for strategic initiative for LG Nova.

These projects, along with many others across the nation, are benefiting from energy tax credits within bills signed by former President Joe Biden, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But Carmichael said these tax credits are vital to Trump’s goal to return manufacturing back to the United States.

“I’m proud to lead Built for America as Executive Director because the fight to defend the energy tax credits driving America’s manufacturing comeback is one we can’t afford to lose,” Carmichael said. “Built for America is a new organization working to defend the tax credits that are powering America’s manufacturing comeback, creating jobs, and helping America beat China.”

Following his inauguration for a second non-consecutive term in January, Trump ordered all federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the 2022 IRA or the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in a 215-214-1 vote, sending it to the U.S. Senate.

The bill is a budget and spending reconciliation package which continues the 2017 tax cuts that went into effect during Trump’s first term and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill also includes nearly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts through various methods, including work requirements for Medicaid benefits and the elimination of several tax credits made possible by the IRA.

Specifically, the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would eliminate tax breaks and incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen projects, as well as phase out tax credits for consumers purchasing new electric vehicles among other rollbacks. If enacted as the House intended, the rollbacks could end more than $522 billion in investments made possible through the IRA.

However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work.

“They reward U.S. companies that build here, hire here, and deliver results by putting America first,” Carmichael said. “Unlike mandates…these credits are performance-based and results-driven. They support an all-of-the-above energy approach, empowering innovation in nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and other emerging technologies.”

Carmichael also said repealing the tax breaks would benefit companies competing with the U.S. for energy, such as China. Built for America is launching a $2 million ad campaign aimed at swaying Congress and the White House to reconsider some of the proposed cuts.

“No one has done more to jumpstart American manufacturing than President Trump, and these credits are aligned with his America First mission,” Carmichael said. “They’re helping us beat China, rebuild the middle class, and power a new era of American industrial strength. That’s a fight worth having.

“Repealing these credits would ship jobs and supply chains back to China and hand America’s energy future to our adversaries,” Carmichael continued. “That’s why I’m proud to stand with Built for America and lead this fight.”

Capito, R-W.Va., is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA. Speaking to reporters Thursday during a weekly phone call from Capitol Hill. Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases.

“Everything was tilted towards clean energy, and it was just incredibly lopsided and incredibly generous, so those need to be scaled back no doubt, and some of them absolutely probably need to be stopped immediately,” Capito said. “Others, I think, need a better transition.”

As an example, Capito cited the 45V hydrogen tax credit created by the IRA, which offers incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, with potential payouts up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Capito advocated for regional hydrogen hubs in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including what is now the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub project.

“The House put in their bill that in order for you to take advantage of 45V…you have to be under construction by the end of this year,” Capito said. “Well, you and I both know, and I think those at the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub know, that’s impossible. That knocks us out of the game, and I don’t want to see us knocked out of being a leader on a new and promising type of energy production…So, I’ve asked if we can make provisions there.”

Once other Senate committees release their reconciliation language, the Senate could begin voting on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill reconciliation package by the end of next week. Capito said Congress needs to get the energy incentives right.

“We need to unleash American energy,” Capito said. “The (previous) administration has spent three and a half years trying to cap our American innovation in the energy space and we’re going to open it back up again – one of (Trump’s) main tenants for his presidency…I’m very excited to be able to be a part of that.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.weirtondailytimes.com/images/2016/08/19083913/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:20.879938

MEAN and Kimball Wind then entered into a power purchase agreement, where MEAN would purchase the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output for twenty years and the Kimball Wind Farm would deliver electricity by June 2018.
Facing an impending deadline to begin delivering electricity, Kimball Wind agreed under protest to be responsible for the remaining costs.
Kimball Wind seeks an order for a reimbursement, either as a cash payment from WAPA or a three-party rate-crediting agreement between WAPA, MEAN, and Kimball Wind.
The order Kimball Wind seeks thus would direct WAPA to grant MEAN rate credits and MEAN to reimburse Kimball Wind.","Kimball Wind, LLC, operates a wind facility in Nebraska that generates electricity transmitted on a network owned and operated by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Before Kimball Wind's facility began its operations, WAPA determined that a substation expansion was necessary to ensure the network could safely and reliably transmit the facility's electricity output. WAPA offered to cover part of the expansion costs but required that Kimball Wind commit to pay the rest. Kimball Wind agreed under protest, believing that WAPA wrongfully made it responsible for most of the expansion costs.

Kimball Wind petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Commission) for an order, pursuant to section 211A of the Federal Power Act (FPA), directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind's contribution to the substation expansion. The Commission determined that section 211A does not provide for the relief sought by Kimball Wind. We agree. Kimball Wind did not seek an order for transmission services—the sole form of relief provided by section 211A. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.

I.

A.

Transmission lines play an important role in the electric grid, moving electricity produced by generators across long distances to reach consumers. To maintain open access to transmission lines, sections 205 and 206 of the FPA authorize the Commission to regulate the transmission services provided by certain utilities, 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a), to ensure that they are provided at just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates, id. § 824d(a)–(b). But not all transmission utilities fall within the Commission's authority under sections 205 and 206. Entities of the federal government that own and operate transmission lines, for example, are outside the scope of those sections. See id. § 824(f).

To address this gap, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 added section 211A to the FPA. Section 211A gives the Commission jurisdiction over “unregulated transmitting utilities,” which include agencies, authorities, or instrumentalities of the United States that “own[ ] or operate[ ] facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.” Id. §§ 824(f), 824j-1(a)–(b). WAPA is an unregulated transmitting utility, as it is an entity within the U.S. Department of Energy that owns and operates a transmission network over fifteen states.

The Commission's statutory authority over unregulated transmitting utilities, however, is limited. Because unregulated transmitting utilities may provide transmission services to themselves and other customers, section 211A is “designed to foster an open and competitive energy market by promoting access to transmission services on equal terms.” Nw. Requirements Utils. v. FERC, 798 F.3d 796, 808 (9th Cir. 2015). Accordingly, under section 211A, the Commission may only order an unregulated transmitting utility to “provide transmission services,” “(1) at rates that are comparable to those that the unregulated transmitting utility charges itself; and (2) on terms ․ that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself and that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential.” 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b).

Section 211A grants the Commission discretionary authority. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. FERC, 762 F.3d 41, 95–96 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining that “section 211A plainly permits, but does not mandate, the Commission to require [an unregulated transmitting utility] to provide transmission service on given terms”). The Commission has seen fit to issue an order pursuant to section 211A only once, then providing prospective relief and stressing that it “expect[ed] that the need to use this statutory authority would be rare.” Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., 137 FERC ¶ 61,185, ¶ 32 (2011).

B.

The dispute in this case stems from a long-running project to develop wind-based electricity generation in Nebraska. In 2016, the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska (MEAN) requested proposals to upgrade an existing wind generation facility. MEAN selected Kimball Wind's proposal to develop an upgraded facility (“the Kimball Wind Farm”). MEAN and Kimball Wind then entered into a power purchase agreement, where MEAN would purchase the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output for twenty years and the Kimball Wind Farm would deliver electricity by June 2018. To begin delivering its electricity output, the Kimball Wind Farm had to connect to WAPA's transmission network.

WAPA transmits electricity for MEAN pursuant to a transmission services agreement. As required by that agreement, MEAN requested that WAPA transmit the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output, which would be delivered through the Kimball Substation, and then along a long-distance transmission line, the Archer-Sidney Line.

In considering MEAN's request, WAPA carried out preliminary studies to assess whether any changes to the network's infrastructure were necessary to safely and reliably transmit the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output. WAPA's studies concluded that adding the Kimball Wind Farm's output to WAPA's transmission network would “cause an overall degradation in protective coverage for the Archer-Sidney ․ line,” and recommended expanding the Kimball Substation “with a four breaker ring bus.” J.A. 72. WAPA estimated that the overall cost for the substation expansion would be about $6.5 million.

The question then became who would pay for the substation expansion. WAPA offered to contribute $2.2 million, and proposed that MEAN pay the rest. MEAN declined and notified WAPA that it would not be a party to any agreement regarding the substation expansion. Facing an impending deadline to begin delivering electricity, Kimball Wind agreed under protest to be responsible for the remaining costs. Kimball Wind ultimately paid around $5.9 million. Kimball Wind then turned to the Commission for relief.

C.

Kimball Wind petitioned the Commission for an order, pursuant to section 211A, directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind's contribution to the substation expansion. In May 2023, the Commission issued an order denying the petition. As a threshold matter, the Commission found that Kimball Wind could file a petition because section 211A does not limit who can seek an order. The Commission determined, however, that the relief Kimball Wind requested was not appropriate under section 211A, because: (1) Kimball Wind did not seek an order for transmission services; (2) Kimball Wind was not WAPA's transmission service customer; and (3) even if section 211A authorized a reimbursement, Kimball Wind did not provide any evidence it received non-comparable transmission service from WAPA or explain how the requested relief would remedy such non-comparable service.

Kimball Wind then filed a request for rehearing, arguing that the order was internally inconsistent by finding that Kimball Wind could file a petition but could not obtain relief under section 211A, and that the order departed from Commission precedent without explanation and was unsupported by substantial evidence. The Commission denied Kimball Wind's request for rehearing. Kimball Wind filed this consolidated petition for review of the Commission's orders. WAPA, the American Public Power Association, and Large Public Power Council intervened.

II.

A.

We have jurisdiction to review the Commission's final orders. 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b). We review the Commission's orders under the Administrative Procedure Act's arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law standard. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); LSP Transmission Holdings II, LLC v. FERC, 45 F.4th 979, 991 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying the APA's arbitrary-and-capricious standard to review actions under the FPA). “[W]hen addressing a question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text,” and apply “the traditional tools of statutory construction.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. FERC, 113 F.4th 943, 948 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted).

B.

The key question before us is whether section 211A authorizes the Commission to issue an order directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind for its contribution to the substation expansion. We agree with the Commission that Kimball Wind does not seek an order for transmission services—the only type of order the Commission may issue under section 211A. Because the Commission's orders can be sustained on that determination alone, we do not address its other reasons for declining Kimball Wind's petition. See Williams Gas Processing-Gulf Coast Co., L.P. v. FERC, 475 F.3d 319, 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006).

Pursuant to section 211A, the Commission may only order “an unregulated transmitting utility to provide transmission services” on comparable terms and rates. 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b). Kimball Wind seeks an order for a reimbursement, either as a cash payment from WAPA or a three-party rate-crediting agreement between WAPA, MEAN, and Kimball Wind. Kimball Wind contends that an order instructing WAPA to reimburse it for its contribution to the substation expansion is an order to “provide transmission services.” We are not persuaded.

First, Kimball Wind's request for a direct cash refund from WAPA would not result in an order for transmission services. Kimball Wind acknowledges that the only relief it seeks is “the refund of [its] construction costs.” Oral Arg. Tr. 12:18–20. It does not seek a transmission services agreement with WAPA, and it is not currently a party to such an agreement. An order directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind with a cash refund would neither require that WAPA provide transmission services to Kimball Wind nor modify the terms on which WAPA provides transmission services to any other party. Cf. Iberdrola Renewables, 137 FERC ¶ 61,185, ¶ 30 (ordering an unregulated transmission utility to prospectively modify the terms and conditions on which it provides transmission services).

Second, Kimball Wind's request for a three-party rate-crediting agreement would not result in an order for transmission services. Under Kimball Wind's proposed three-party rate-crediting agreement, WAPA would adjust the rate it charges MEAN for transmitting electricity, and MEAN would then use this rebate to reimburse Kimball Wind. The order Kimball Wind seeks thus would direct WAPA to grant MEAN rate credits and MEAN to reimburse Kimball Wind. Such an order would not direct WAPA or MEAN to provide transmission services to Kimball Wind.

On Kimball Wind's petition, neither an order for a cash refund nor an order for a three-party rate-credit agreement would “require an unregulated transmitting utility to provide transmission services.” 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b). The Commission, therefore, correctly concluded that Kimball Wind seeks relief that section 211A cannot provide.

C.

Kimball Wind also contends that the Commission's orders are arbitrary and capricious, because they are internally inconsistent or because they are an unreasonable and unjustified departure from Commission precedent and policy disfavoring direct assignment of network upgrade costs. We do not reach these questions in light of our preceding conclusion that the Commission lacks statutory authority under section 211A to order that WAPA reimburse Kimball Wind. And Kimball Wind identifies no other independent statutory basis for the reimbursement it seeks.

III.

For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.

So ordered.

FOOTNOTES

. The Kimball Wind Farm is connected to a substation owned by the City of Kimball, which in turn is connected to the Kimball Substation by a transmission line owned by the City of Kimball.

. Neither the Tucker Act nor the Contracts Dispute Act limit our jurisdiction over Kimball Wind's petition, because “at its essence” this case does not turn on a contractual dispute, Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982), and turns instead on the scope of the Commission's authority under section 211A, see Crowley Gov't Servs, Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2022).

. Although section 211A does not provide for the relief Kimball Wind seeks, Kimball Wind has still shown that its claimed injury—the Commission's denial of a reimbursement order—is redressable for purposes of Article III standing. “[D]uring the standing inquiry,” the Court “accepts [petitioner's statutory] interpretation ․ as correct.” BP Energy Co. v. FERC, 828 F.3d 959, 963 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotations and citations omitted). Assuming that Kimball Wind will prevail in its argument that section 211A authorizes the Commission to grant the reimbursement it seeks, a favorable ruling from this Court would redress its injury.

We continue to appreciate the work of Senators Grassley and Ernst in supporting these tax credits over the years.","Clean energy advocates warn Iowa stands to lose jobs and renewable energy project expansions, and businesses and households will see an increase in utility bills if Congress passes President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill as is.

Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who represents southeast Iowa, made similar warnings to House Republican leaders urging them to maintain the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits.

The Republican incumbent — who is expected to run for re-election to a fourth term in 2026 — however, has come under fire from Democrats and the same clean energy advocates for voting to pass the tax and spending policy bill despite her push to preserve the tax credits that would be rolled back under the legislation.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation.

“Renewable energy is a vital, and growing industry in Iowa. It provides good jobs and cheap electricity for the entire state,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Friday calling out Miller-Meeks and the rest of Iowa’s U.S. House members who voted for the bill. “Iowa's Republican representatives just helped deal Iowa's renewable energy sector a major blow, all to pass tax cuts for the millionaires and billionaires who are calling the shots.”

The reconciliation bill passed by the House and being considered by the Senate — referred to as Trump's “one big beautiful bill” — proposes significant changes to clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed into law by Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The bill accelerates the phaseout and, in some cases, effectively eliminates key clean energy tax credits, including those for wind, solar and battery storage projects.

Miller-Meeks repeatedly advocated for maintaining the IRA’s energy tax credits. In August 2024, Miller-Meeks was one of 18 House Republicans who signed on to a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson pushing him to preserve the IRA’s energy tax credits, touting the jobs they had created and the investments made across America by multiple companies because of them.

Like others who signed, Miller-Meeks voted against the IRA in August 2022. While acknowledging the bill contained some key provisions — such as the clean energy tax credits — she said the bill overall was “deeply flawed.” She considered the legislation to be a $740 billion spending bill “filled with partisan priorities,” and argued it was not the time to pass such legislation given the country's economic situation and inflation rates at the time.

The August 2024 letter warned: “Today, many U.S. companies are already using sector-wide energy tax credits — many of which have enjoyed bipartisan support historically — to make major investments in new U.S. energy infrastructure.

“We hear from industry and our constituents who fear the energy tax regime will once again be turned on its head due to Republican repeal efforts,” the letter continues. “Prematurely repealing energy tax credits, particularly those which were used to justify investments that already broke ground, would undermine private investments and stop development that is already ongoing. A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.”

Miller-Meeks and Republican co-signers also pointed out, “Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country — including many districts represented by members of our conference.”

They asked the House speaker to “consider us partners in reforming our tax policies in a way that puts America first while ensuring certainty for industry and the energy sector.”

In March 2025, Rep. Miller-Meeks signed on to a letter to Ways And Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, warning that multiple projects would be “jeopardized” if the tax credits were repealed.

In May 2025, Rep. Miller-Meeks signed on to another letter to Rep. Smith saying she strongly supported the energy tax credits and asking him to preserve them, warning that repealing the credits would lead to a 10 percent increase in consumer electricity costs.

In January, at a House Ways And Means Committee Hearing, Miller-Meeks testified that the IRA’s energy tax credits were “delivering” economic benefits to communities nationwide, and that their repeal “would be a setback to clean energy, and importantly economic growth, and put Brazil first, not America first.”

Miller-Meeks is chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus and a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

A spokesperson for her office said — like any piece of major legislation — while unable to secure everything she wanted in the reconciliation bill, she was able to preserve some key energy tax credits while scoring other significant conservative policy wins for Iowans. That includes extending the 2017 federal tax cuts; restoring American energy production by increasing oil and gas leasing and drilling on federal lands and expediting the approval process for oil and gas exploration and extraction; and increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement.

""I voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act because it prevents the largest tax hike on families and small businesses in American history, secures the border and unleashes American energy dominance,“ Miller-Meeks said in a statement to The Gazette. ”I’m proud that we were able to keep key energy tax credits that will expand domestic power generation, create good-paying jobs, and lower utility costs. This bill is a win for Iowa.”

She noted the bill also:

Tax incentives spurred clean energy projects

New clean energy and manufacturing projects have seen substantial growth in Iowa and across the country since new federal tax incentives were put in place in 2022, according to Climate Power, a strategic communications firm highlighting how clean energy investments benefit local communities.

This repeal comes at a time when energy costs and utility bills are already going up, and will increase more if energy sources like wind and solar are not available to meet much higher demand, according to the firm.

A study by Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) determined that repealing the federal investment (§48E) and the production tax credits (§45Y) would raise electricity and natural gas prices, lead to job losses and economic slowdown, and lower household incomes across 19 states between 2026 and 2032.

In Iowa, CEBA estimates the reconciliation bill will lead to 5,000 fewer jobs, a $370 average loss in annual household income and a $590 million decrease in goods and services produced in the state.

According to Climate Power, if tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed as outlined in the House reconciliation bill, Iowa households would see an average increase in annual electricity bills of $67 in both 2030 and 2035, and annual energy bill increases of $132 in both 2030 and 2035.

Five new clean energy projects have been announced and private companies have announced plans to create 1,102 new clean energy jobs in the state since the passage of the IRA.

Iowa relies on clean energy

Sixty-two percent of Iowa’s total energy generation came from clean energy in 2023, with wind power generation accounting for 59 percent. Iowa’s solar power production increased by 92 percent from March 2024 to March 2025.

The state is home to 13.91 gigawatts of operating clean energy capacity, enough to power more than 10 million homes, according to Climate Power. Another 0.29 gigawatts of clean energy capacity is planned in the state, including a solar project in Muscatine County and the Silver Creek Wind Farm in southwest Iowa, both of which are scheduled to come online in the fall.

Iowa is already home to 99 data centers, one of the largest concentrations in the Midwest. In 2023, data centers accounted for 11.43 percent of the total electricity consumed in the state, ranking fourth nationwide.

Policy analysts have cited data centers’ energy usage as a reason for utility rate hikes on customers.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

Alliant Energy said the utility continues to monitor and will be watching closely as the Senate continues their work on the bill.

MidAmerican Energy spokesperson Geoff Greenwood said MidAmerican, too, is closely monitoring progress of the bill through Congress, adding “production tax credits have been key to reducing the cost of new generation projects for our customers.”

“We have made significant investments in renewable energy over the past 20 years, and in 2024, MidAmerican delivered the equivalent of 100 percent carbon-free energy to serve our Iowa customers’ electricity usage,” Greenwood said. “Renewable energy makes up 91.7 percent of that energy delivered over the course of the year. We continue to appreciate the work of Senators Grassley and Ernst in supporting these tax credits over the years.

“Our customers’ demand for electricity is only growing, so MidAmerican will continue to propose new generation projects to support that growth,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican’s Solar Reliability Project, which is pending before the Iowa Utilities Commission, is one such project and an essential part of our all-of-the-above generation approach to serve that demand.”

This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed on Wednesday that its plan to eviscerate power plant pollution standards will save the US about $1 billion a year. In reality, though, this represents a starkly uneven trade-off, experts say.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time, climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.

“The massive cost to the public compared to the minuscule benefits is breathtaking,” said Charles Harper, power sector campaigner at green group Evergreen Action. “The costs will be borne by the American people who will breathe dirtier air and those around the world suffering from climate change. The benefits will go to a very small group of donors. Perhaps they should change the name of the agency if they are no longer about protecting the health of Americans.”

The EPA is proposing to entirely ditch all restrictions on planet-heating emissions coming from US power plants, the second largest source of carbon pollution in the country, while also weakening a separate regulation designed to limit the amount of harmful toxins, such as mercury, seeping from these power plants into Americans’ air, water and soils.

These restrictions were imposed by Joe Biden to “advance the climate change cult” and the “green new scam,” according to Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, at an unveiling of the rollbacks on Wednesday that did not mention any benefit to the environment or public health.

“Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil, and gas out of existence,” said Zeldin, who touted the need for “beautiful clean coal” and for the US to develop artificial intelligence, neither a core EPA responsibility.

In justifying its decision, the EPA has claimed that power plant emissions “do not contribute significantly” to the climate crisis—despite US electricity generation being one of the largest single sources of such pollution in the world—and that the rollbacks will save the country $19 billion over two decades, or about $1.2 billion a year.

However, this “saving” is entirely for the benefit of power plant operators who won’t have to install technology to reduce hazardous pollution, rather than the broader public. The EPA has said overall electricity costs will go down, too, but did not provide a figure on any estimated savings from this.

By contrast, the existing climate rule for power plants, put in place by Biden last year, was previously estimated by the EPA to save the US $370 billion by the 2040s, at about $20 billion a year, via climate and public health benefits. The rule is also expected to slash more than 1 billion tons in carbon emissions and save thousands of lives from reduced air pollution.

Experts said that the vast 20 to one discrepancy in benefits, and who they flow to, represents a damaging favor given to the fossil fuel interests that have strongly backed Trump, at the expense of the American public.

“The only people who benefit from these rollbacks are the biggest emitters of toxic pollution who don’t want to install cleaner technologies,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group composed of former EPA staff. “American families will pay the cost of these rollbacks in higher healthcare bills from emergency room visits, missed work days, and missed school days. This proposal is scientifically indefensible and represents a complete abdication of EPA’s responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.”

Under Trump, the EPA has set about dismantling an array of clean air and water protections and adopted the president’s agenda of boosting fossil fuel production. The agency argues that casting off such regulations will bolster the economy and save money for households.

“Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of base load power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the artificial intelligence capital of the world,” said an EPA spokesperson. “Regulatory costs are inherently regressive—placing a heavier burden on those who can least afford it. These costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher utility bills and rolling blackouts.”

But, critics warn that the EPA’s traditional purpose to protect public health and the environment is being rapidly eroded.

“EPA’s proposal to stop regulating emissions of greenhouse gases and mercury from US power plants reflects Trump’s breathtaking willingness to sacrifice public health and progress against climate change in the service of the nation’s worst polluters,” said John Holdren, who served as Barack Obama’s science adviser. “In this and so many other ways, Trump and his enablers are doing their best to drive this country off a cliff.

“American jobs, economic competitiveness, health, environment, national security, and standing in the world are all in peril from Trump’s ignorance and reckless disregard for the public good,” said Holdren, who now co-directs the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University’s Belfer Center.

The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.

It came as part of Trump’s assault on pollution regulations. Taken together, his administration’s planned environmental rollbacks—including of power plant and tailpipe emission standards and clean energy incentives from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—will result in 22,800 additional pollution-related deaths and a $1.1 trillion reduction in US GDP by 2035, a University of Maryland study published on Thursday found.

Julie McNamara, an associate director at the science, climate, and health-focused advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, said Zeldin’s Wednesday proposal was “shameful”.

“There’s no meaningful path to meet US climate goals without addressing carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants—and there’s no meaningful path to meet global climate goals without the United States,” she said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20210209_zaa_s197_290.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-14 11:07:59.054101

These projects, including Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind and New York’s Empire Wind, are creating thousands of jobs and will power millions of homes.

Opponents of these projects cite concerns about ocean views and potential harm to marine life, but these claims are often unsubstantiated.

Is it possible the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were wrong?

While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities cheered on the impending death of clean energy, the turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction.

Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete. In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail. With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs.

A stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind was rescinded recently. Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power a half-million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition.

Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But, at least for now, the project has been safe from President Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support.

Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.

After a devastating turbine break stopped construction in July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work. Their project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is also generating electricity – though how much is impossible to establish since the developer, possibly in response to the high-profile attacks on wind by the Trump administration, has opted to answer few questions about the work.

Each of these projects has, so far, survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations and transmission cables; phony ""grassroots"" organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed.

Silence may be a winning strategy: One of the directors of the Dominion project said recently that continued construction came from “keeping our head down.” Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power. Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations.

They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2,300,000 cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean.

Every day, the U.S. sends 780,000 barrels of refined products back to Canada and more than 1 million barrels to Mexico.
A vast, interconnected pipeline network spans the continent, bolstering U.S. energy security with stable, predictable supplies from Canada and Mexico.
The upcoming G-7 summit is more than a diplomatic gathering — it’s a moment to reaffirm North America’s leadership in the global energy arena.","With the upcoming G-7 summit set to take place Sunday through Tuesday in Alberta — Canada’s energy heartland — President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Carney are uniquely positioned to champion a bold vision: reasserting and securing North American energy dominance.

Doing so wouldn’t represent just a win for the United States and Canada. It would create a strategic advantage for their European and Asian allies as well.

The G-7 should embrace energy abundance by cooperating and committing to a rapid expansion of energy infrastructure. Members should commit to streamlined permitting, including a one-stop shop for permitting and environmental review, to unleash the capital investment necessary to make energy abundance a reality.

North America’s energy success story is built on deep continental integration and a relentless entrepreneurial drive. Together, these forces have made the region one of the most prosperous and energy-secure in the world.

From the earliest days of oil’s rise as a dominant energy source, the United States has led the way — not only in exploration and discovery but also in building the world’s most advanced and expansive refining infrastructure.

Today, global refining capacity stands at over 103 million barrels per day. Remarkably, nearly one-fifth of that — 18 million barrels — is processed in the United States alone.

These refineries are economic engines, directly employing nearly 65,000 Americans in high-paying jobs. With median earnings around $95,000 and many workers earning six-figure salaries, the industry supports a thriving middle class. An additional 1.4 million Americans work in supply chains and corporate operations that keep these refineries running.

To maintain this momentum, the U.S. relies heavily on its own oil production — averaging 13.2 million barrels per day last year, primarily light crude. But here’s the catch: American refineries are optimized for heavy crude, which is more cost-effective and essential for maximizing output and profitability.

Enter Canada and Mexico. Canada supplies 2.8 million barrels of heavy crude daily to U.S. Midwest refineries, while Mexico contributes another 780,000 barrels to Gulf Coast facilities. This steady flow of heavy crude is vital — it keeps energy costs low and allows the U.S. to export its higher-value light crude, advancing Trump’s vision of energy dominance.

Consider this: The $99 billion in crude oil imported from Alberta alone is transformed by U.S. refineries into $361 billion worth of energy products — much of which is exported. Every day, the U.S. sends 780,000 barrels of refined products back to Canada and more than 1 million barrels to Mexico. This seamless energy integration benefits all three nations.

The same synergy powers the natural gas sector. A vast, interconnected pipeline network spans the continent, bolstering U.S. energy security with stable, predictable supplies from Canada and Mexico. This not only supplements domestic production but also fuels booming exports.

Thanks to competitively priced Canadian gas, Americans in the Midwest, Mountain West and Pacific Northwest enjoy lower energy costs. Excess gas flows to the Gulf Coast and Maryland, where it’s liquefied and shipped to Europe and Asia.

This system enables the U.S. to export 11.5 billion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas daily — generating revenue, creating jobs and providing allies with a secure, pressure-free alternative to Russian and Chinese energy.

The G-7 summit will spotlight this powerful continental alliance. Nations such as Japan, France, Germany, Italy and the UK are urgently seeking reliable energy sources — not just to meet rising demand, but to reduce dependence on volatile suppliers such as Russia and Iran.

North America is ready to answer that call. With its unmatched resources and infrastructure, and reformed permitting regulations, the continent can become the trusted energy partner the world needs.

The United States, with its robust pipeline networks reaching both coasts, is well-positioned to meet Europe’s energy demands — advancing Trump’s agenda while boosting exports and revenues.

Meanwhile, Canada’s expanding infrastructure to its western ports opens the door to supplying key Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

The upcoming G-7 summit is more than a diplomatic gathering — it’s a moment to reaffirm North America’s leadership in the global energy arena. Let’s not waste it.

Deliver In order to ensure awarded offshore wind capacity can be delivered and existing capacity retained, there needs to be a relentless focus within Government on ensuring policies are conducive to this.","2025 marks 25 years of offshore wind in the UK. Since the first turbine was installed in Blyth in 2000, the UK has become a global offshore wind leader with around 15GW of installed capacity. The UK’s ambitious target of achieving Clean Power by 2030 (CP2030) and 43-50GW of offshore wind signals to investors that the UK is open for business when it comes to clean energy. The target doesn’t just stand as a galvanising call to action, but as a huge economic opportunity to deliver investment and jobs to parts of the country that need it most.

However, this needs to be delivered against a difficult global backdrop. It has been a tough few years for the offshore wind sector. Global macroeconomic headwinds in the form of inflation, high interest rates and supply chain pressures have led to failed auctions in multiple markets, including Contracts for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round 5 (AR5) in the UK, and projects have been delayed or cancelled as a result. In response, developers and investors have been raising hurdle rates, concentrating on fewer core markets, and seeking to prioritise ‘value over volume’.

Despite the UK Government reacting quickly in AR6 to adjust auction parameters to economic realities, wider factors outside of their control (such as tariffs) continue to pose a risk. We’re not out of the woods yet.

Along with others, Equinor has been impacted by these challenges and has adjusted its short-term renewable ambitions in response. Notwithstanding this, Equinor is maintaining its long-term commitment to net zero by 2050 and reconfirming its view on the important role offshore wind will play in the energy transition.

The UK has been one of the most attractive markets globally to develop offshore wind and remains a core market for Equinor. Today our UK wind farms power 750,000 homes and by 2030, as part of our own journey towards net zero, we aim to power 7 million British homes, taking us from megawatts to gigawatts.

The UK is where we built the world's first floating wind farm, Hywind Scotland, and where we are now building the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank, with our partners SSE and Vårgrønn. When fully operational, over 400 people will operate and maintain the wind farm – part of a wider 2,000+ jobs created or sustained through the project.

Alongside our partners, we are also planning to extend our operational Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon projects off the Norfolk coast and develop a fourth phase of Dogger Bank. During the construction phase, these extension projects are anticipated to support more than 1,800 full time jobs per year across the UK and within East Anglia, generating more than £370 million in direct gross value added (GVA) to the economy.

However, having ambition alone is not sufficient and without further urgent action this economic opportunity presented by CP2030 is at risk.

AR7 later this year is the last best chance to secure ‘shovel-ready’ projects that can deliver for 2030. However, with network charging, connections reform, auction rules and wider market design all in flux there is an unprecedented amount of uncertainty going into this year’s auction. Several key decisions from Government over the next 100 days may well determine whether the CP2030 target remains achievable, or, more importantly, whether the potential economic benefits for the UK can be realised.

That is why Equinor is pleased to be an event partner at this year’s Global Offshore Wind (GOW) Conference (17– 18 June), as we believe the focus on the theme of ‘Mission: Possible’ couldn’t come at a more critical time. It offers an opportunity for industry, supply chain and policy makers to come together and align on the action needed.

From Equinor’s perspective the action needed now can be summarised in three steps: reset, scale and deliver.

Reset

Making the right call on key decisions over the next 100 days will be key to resetting investor confidence sufficiently ahead of AR7 for the auction to be successful.

A prompt decision needs to be made on Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) and this needs to provide as much clarity and certainty as possible (e.g. on legacy arrangements) to investors well ahead of AR7. Whatever your view of the proposals to move to zonal pricing, it’s clear that, were the uncertainty to be prolonged or the can to be kicked down the road, this would lead to additional risk premia being priced into CfD bids that could otherwise be avoided by a clear decision either way.

Whether to extend the CfD contract term beyond 15 years as another big open question. With projects now having economic lifetimes of around 35 years, the current CfD contract covers less than 50% of the asset life. Our analysis has shown that extending the CfD to at least 20 years can reduce merchant tail risk and the cost of capital, bringing down CfD break-even prices by up to 10%.

The decision on CfD eligibility also looms large. Recent events show that delivery risk persists even once a project has secured its CfD. It’s our view that this risk is even higher the less mature a project is, which could undermine supply chain investments, and if the non-delivery framework is not strengthened this could encourage speculative bidding. Ultimately, if unconsented projects are to be eligible for the CfD then they should be bound to the same rules as consented projects to maintain a level playing field in the auction.

Scale

AR7 will undoubtedly need to deliver a record level of new offshore wind volume to keep the 2030 targets within reach. However, when it comes to securing pre-2030 inward investment into supply chain capacity, post-2030 pipeline visibility and certainty will be equally key.

As we argued at last year’s GOW, it takes more than one offshore wind project to make a factory, and it will take more than one successful auction to provide the supply chain with the line of sight to future orders to overcome fears of overcapacity in the long-term and have the confidence to invest in the short term. This is particularly important for floating offshore wind, where investment in enabling port infrastructure will be key to enabling local assembly.

We believe the Government should introduce an annual minimum capacity ambition based on long-term volume targets derived from the Strategic Spatial Energy Plan. This, in combination with a forward-looking schedule of seabed lease and CfD auctions, tailored to both fixed and floating wind, would, in our view, go a long way to enabling the supply chain and ports to scale up. A similar call was made at April’s WindEurope conference in Copenhagen, where industry called for 100GW of auctions over 10 years across the EU.

Deliver

In order to ensure awarded offshore wind capacity can be delivered and existing capacity retained, there needs to be a relentless focus within Government on ensuring policies are conducive to this.

Grid supply chains, particularly for HVDC, are under huge strain with transmission companies and developers, who are all competing for the same scarce supply chain capacity and manufacturing slots around the world. Government should consider establishing an equivalent of the Electricity Transmission Advanced Procurement Mechanism, a scheme put in place by Ofgem for Onshore Transmission Owners, to help developers manage large pre-commitments in the grid supply chain.

Many of the UK’s first offshore wind farms which make up the 15GW of current installed capacity will, by the early 2030s, be approaching the end of their original operational life. Action on policies to support lifetime extension and/or repowering is therefore needed to prevent the loss of renewable capacity.

Other live topics within the industry, such as wake effects, would also benefit from being viewed through the lens of whether they help this existing capacity to be retained.

The industry’s understanding of far-field wake effects has grown significantly in the last few years, and while there are differing views on how to respond, in our view it has become clear that buffers used in previous leasing rounds are not sufficient to mitigate the significant commercial impacts from wake effects. Whether existing projects are compensated or not for generation loses due to unforeseen wake effects from new lease areas will have a material effect on end-of-life decisions. Identifying, mitigating and potentially compensating impacts on other seabed users is already a key part of the planning framework and our view is that this issue should be no different. Key upcoming decisions in the planning process this year will likely set a precedent on this issue for years to come.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-14 08:01:22.271962

This move will allow GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the US. The announcement comes shortly after the company committed $888 million to enhance its Tonawanda Propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, for the development of GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

General Motors is set to enhance its US production capabilities by expanding key manufacturing plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. These plants will play a pivotal role in increasing the output of some of GM’s most popular vehicles. This move is aimed at meeting the growing demand for both gasoline-powered and electric vehicles in the US market. Each facility will focus on different vehicle types, ensuring that GM can continue to deliver a diverse lineup to its customers.

In Orion Township, Michigan, the Orion Assembly plant will begin producing gasoline-powered full-size SUVs and light-duty pickup trucks by early 2027. This facility’s new production line is designed to support the increasing demand for these vehicles. Meanwhile, GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan, will become the exclusive site for assembling the all-electric models, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Hummer EV. This strategic division of labor ensures that GM can efficiently manage the production of both traditional and electric vehicles in the region.

Kansas City, Kansas, will also see an uptick in production with the Fairfax Assembly plant slated to begin manufacturing the gasoline Chevrolet Equinox in mid-2027. The Equinox has already experienced a 30% increase in sales year-over-year in early 2025, reflecting the vehicle’s growing popularity. In addition to the Equinox, Fairfax is set to start producing the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV later this year. GM has further plans to invest in this facility for the production of its next-generation, affordable electric vehicles, reinforcing its commitment to EV innovation.

Spring Hill, Tennessee, will be another focal point for GM’s production expansion. Starting in 2027, Spring Hill Manufacturing will add the production of the gasoline-powered Chevrolet Blazer to its existing lines. The facility will continue to produce the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs, as well as the Cadillac XT5, which has been a key model for the brand. This expansion aims to meet the increasing demand for both gasoline and electric vehicles while supporting GM’s overall strategy for a more sustainable future.

These investments in US manufacturing plants underscore GM’s commitment to expanding its vehicle offerings while supporting American jobs. With an emphasis on both gasoline and electric vehicles, GM is positioning itself to lead the industry in innovation and production capacity. As the automotive landscape evolves, these plants will play a crucial role in GM’s strategy to meet the diverse needs of customers across the country.

“We believe the future of transportation will be shaped by American innovation and manufacturing,” said Mary Barra, GM’s Chair and CEO. “This investment highlights our continued dedication to US manufacturing and American jobs. Our goal is to give customers a wide variety of vehicles they can choose from and love.” GM operates 50 manufacturing plants across 19 US states, including 11 vehicle assembly facilities. The company supports nearly one million American jobs, including employees, suppliers, and dealers.

“Today’s announcement is more than just about numbers — it’s about hardworking Americans building vehicles they’re proud of, and that customers are proud to own,” said GM President Mark Reuss. “The scale of our manufacturing operations and their positive impact on communities across the country is something you can see firsthand.”

GM continues to see strong sales across both gasoline and electric vehicles in the US. The company is poised to secure its sixth consecutive year as the top seller of full-size pickups and its 51st year leading in full-size SUV sales. By the second half of 2024, GM became the second-largest seller of electric vehicles in the US, thanks to a portfolio of 13 EV models across Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC. Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand in the US and ranks second among all electric vehicle brands in terms of sales.

GM’s capital spending for 2025 remains in the range of $10 billion to $11 billion, with projections of $10 billion to $12 billion annually through 2027.

May 28, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported a landmark study found the Great Lakes have entered a new era with climate change of extreme events that pose challenges for ecosystems, fisheries, navigation and coastal infrastructure.

At the same time, internal U.S. migration to the Midwest to escape coastal flooding, violent hurricanes and wildfires necessitates investing in systems that reduce carbon emissions to slow warming.

Impact on Data Centers and Other Large Load Customers SB 6 represents one of the earliest state-level efforts to balance the need for effective regulation of large load customers with continued support for industry growth.
These reforms therefore stand to avoid potential political pushback on data center and other large load projects and help establish a more sustainable growth environment for large load customers and generators.","Texas has responded to rapid electrical load growth with legislative reforms.

On June 1, 2025, Texas Senate Bill 6 (SB 6), passed both chambers of the Legislature with bipartisan support and was sent to Governor Abbott for signature. Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, the bill will become effective on September 1, 2025. SB 6 introduces significant changes to how large electricity users interact with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid and marks a notable shift in regulatory policy to address concerns over grid reliability and cost allocations.

ERCOT’s low energy costs have long attracted data centers and other large-scale electricity users. As the rapid growth of data centers, crypto mining and other large energy consumers continues to drive up demand, state officials have recognized the need for a more robust regulatory framework to maintain and enhance grid performance. Recent studies suggest that energy demand in Texas may double by 2031. SB 6 reflects recognition of the increasing demand and marks a policy shift by requiring large-scale electricity users to contribute more to grid investment and operation, while balancing reliability against anticipated demand growth.

Specifically, SB 6 targets new and expanding large load customers by imposing financial and operational requirements targeted at “level[ing] the playing field” between these major consumers and typical retail users. Among other things, the bill requires upfront financial commitments, demonstrable site control and disclosure of any backup generation capacity before such customers can connect to the grid. Additionally, it establishes new interconnection rules for co-located loads connecting to existing generation facilities, including a mandate that such interconnections incorporate an ERCOT-controlled “kill switch” to ensure grid operators can isolate these loads in emergencies.

SB 6 Provisions

Cost Sharing and Interconnection Standards for Large Load Customers

SB 6 introduces new financial and operational requirements for large load customers, defined as facilities with an energy demand of 75 megawatts (MW) or more (e.g., data centers, crypto mines and cloud storage facilities). It is one of the first attempts by a state to directly engage in large load management The bill specifically requires that these large load customers participate in paying for interconnection and grid costs and other ancillary services tied to their facility even when the facility plans to significantly rely on behind-the-meter use.

To establish a new connection to the ERCOT grid, large load customers must also comply with a new set of interconnection standards. They must disclose if they are shopping for electric services elsewhere in the state, to prevent duplicative infrastructure development. Additionally, new large load customers must demonstrate a financial commitment, establish control of the site for the proposed load location and pay the interconnecting utility a flat study fee of at least $100,000 for an initial transmission screening.

Further, large load customers must disclose to ERCOT whether they possess on-site backup generators capable of generating at least 50% of the facility’s requirements. In emergencies, ERCOT may require these large load customers to either deploy their on-site generators or curtail load.

Net Metering Rules and Oversight

SB 6 imposes additional regulatory oversight on new behind-the-meter interconnections and co-location agreements between large load customers and existing generation resources. Under the new rules, prior to implementing a co-location or interconnection agreement with a large load customer, power generation companies must first notify ERCOT of the proposed arrangement. ERCOT is then required to conduct a study of the system impacts of the proposed arrangement and submit its findings to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) for approval. If the PUC does not respond timely, the interconnection agreement is automatically approved by default.

To preserve grid reliability during emergencies, the bill allows the PUC to impose specific conditions on the proposed interconnections and co-location agreements. These conditions may include requiring the behind-the-meter large load customers to curtail use during grid stress events and requiring the generation resource to make grid capacity available to the ERCOT region.

Load Curtailment and Demand Management Protocols

Most notably, SB 6 requires utilities to develop and implement protocols, including the installation of any necessary equipment or technology, to curtail large electrical loads during firm load shed events and emergencies. The utility and the customer should work together to accomplish a coordinated response. This new rule will apply only to new interconnections (excluding critical industrial and natural gas facilities) established after December 31, 2025.

Additionally, SB 6 directs ERCOT to develop a reliability service to competitively procure demand reductions from large load customers. Participating large load customers must curtail their usage during declared emergencies, with at least a 24-hour notice, and remain curtailed for the duration of the emergency or until the load can be safely recalled. ERCOT must prohibit participation by any large load customer that responds to the wholesale price of electricity or that participates in a different reliability service.

Impact on Data Centers and Other Large Load Customers

SB 6 represents one of the earliest state-level efforts to balance the need for effective regulation of large load customers with continued support for industry growth. The deadly blackouts in Texas during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri have made lawmakers more cautious with large loads, and other states could take cues from how industry responds to the Texas legislation. SB 6 imposes constraints for data centers and other high demand customers, particularly those hoping to rely on behind-the-meter generation. Large consumer facility developers may face delays in interconnection and energization timelines. The risk of downtime due to curtailments is significant for data centers, which depend critically on nearly continuous service. These added costs, barriers to connection and interruption risks will likely slow the rapid pace of data center development we’ve seen in Texas in recent years.

Nonetheless, these provisions may serve a longer-term purpose of ensuring grid reliability and efficiency. By heightening oversight and regulating development, ERCOT may be able to spread grid costs across a wider base of users. The costs imposed on the large energy-consuming facilities will enter the stream of commerce and be passed along to customers and investors. The bill’s requirements to notify regulators if projects are being developed elsewhere in the state will also help ensure there is fewer double counting of projects in ERCOT and allow regulators to focus their attention on the projects most likely to be built. These reforms therefore stand to avoid potential political pushback on data center and other large load projects and help establish a more sustainable growth environment for large load customers and generators.

The announcement came last week as the state’s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, headed up the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage.
He was joined by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The federal officials spent days touring Alaska, including visiting the North Slope, where much of Alaska’s drilling and mining is focused.
In 2020, the Trump administration approved the Willow Project, a controversial ConocoPhillips oil drilling project that was later greenlit by the Biden administration.","The Department of the Interior announced a proposal last week to cancel its protections of 13 million acres of Alaskan land inside a previously created reserve.

More than 40 Indigenous communities rely on the acreage in question for clean water and critical subsistence resources like caribou, fish and other wildlife. Indigenous people have occupied the lands inside the reserve for millennia. Protected public lands have grown increasingly important at a time when changing climate conditions have destabilized life in the Arctic.

The announcement came last week as the state’s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, headed up the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage. He was joined by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. The federal officials spent days touring Alaska, including visiting the North Slope, where much of Alaska’s drilling and mining is focused.

While some communities appreciated the cabinet members’ visit to the Arctic and the economic opportunities that increased resource extraction may bring, others worry about the negative effects it could have on their lives and livelihoods.

“ They want to come in and create pipelines and drill and mine and extract and log. We are the ones who will be most greatly impacted,” said Rochelle Adams, director of the Yukon River Protectors, an Indigenous nonprofit organization. “ We’re gonna have the health impacts, and we’re gonna have the medical costs and responsibilities, and we’re going to have bury our loved ones.”

The proposal would rescind the 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule that increased protections of designated “special areas” of Alaskan lands to limit oil and gas development and protect subsistence resources. The rules affect what is called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), which includes 23 million acres of BLM land, of which 13 million acres are special areas due to their wildlife, recreational and subsistence value.

The proposal is open to public comment until August 4, 2025, and is published in the Federal Register.

During the conference, Dunleavy, already 6 feet, 7 inches tall, was seated on stage in a chair with markedly higher legs than the other speakers, and he physically towered over the conversations throughout the day. From this perch, he joined other Republican speakers emphasizing party slogans, including “Make Alaska great again” and “unleashing energy dominance,” and referred to President Donald Trump’s executive order on Alaska energy from January, in which he promised to “immediately reverse” the Biden administration’s restrictions.

“We were sanctioning Alaska more than we were sanctioning Iran,” said Burgum. In a large ballroom with hundreds of attendees, Trump’s cabinet members condemned Biden’s conservation efforts and promised rural Alaskans more energy, jobs and infrastructure.

There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska, and Alaska Natives are divided on the issue of continued development of the fossil fuels that have been a foundation of the state’s economy.

“ How are we ever going to have more development and infrastructure when we can’t even accommodate what we have in these communities already?” said Deilah Johnson, tribal resources director for the Village of Solomon, who was a speaker on rural Alaskan energy.

She said she supports renewable energy and efficiency measures over fossil fuels. She explained that building out infrastructure in Alaska holds unique challenges, such as short building seasons; expensive materials, labor and shipping; and difficult environmental conditions. These factors already hold back existing communities from growth and safe housing for its current residents.

Another speaker, Mayor Josiah Patkotak of North Slope Borough, said that getting communities plugged into the natural gas pipeline instead of drums of diesel would be life-changing. He praised the cabinet members’ overnight stay in his community and said the previous administration had flown in, “had the town hall meeting [and] flew out.”

Dunleavy said public opinion is on the side of the administration, both in Alaska and nationally. His introductory morning talk was followed by a presentation from Matt Larkin of Dittman Research, an Alaska-based polling company. Larkin shared results that said 77 percent of Alaskans supported the construction of a natural gas pipeline, and 61 percent of respondents nationwide supported the governor and cabinet secretaries’ mission to expand Alaska’s role in oil and gas.

Dunleavy and Burgum claimed that relying on imported resources to generate U.S. energy was dangerous, since “ you may end up trying to get minerals or energy from places that are dictatorships or that don’t have laws for good child labor.”

They spoke to a ballroom that was divided among supporters and opponents of the administration’s energy goals. For example, when Zeldin promised that developing the North Slope was the archway to “a golden age of American prosperity and freedom,” some tables of attendees clapped loudly, while others sat silent.

The federal officials had messages specifically for the environmentalists in the room.

“ If you care about the environment, then you should want every drop of oil, every cubic foot of gas, every electron made in the United States because we do it cleaner, smarter and safer than anybody else in the world,” said Burgum.

Environmentalists disagreed. “Oil and gas pollute the environment and cause climate change, period,” said Matt Jackson, who was born and raised in Alaska and was attending the conference as the senior manager for the state at The Wilderness Society, an environmental nonprofit. “The U.S. should be positioning itself as a global leader in the clean, renewable energy that will power the future. While Sec. Burgum is stuck in the past, arguing about whose pollution is the least bad, other countries are overtaking us on the energy technologies that will matter most in the 21st century- renewables.”

At a press briefing after the ballroom speeches, the officials emphasized a different aspect of their proposed development: selling natural gas to Asian markets. Wright, who came to the administration from the oil and gas industry, thanked foreign journalists for attending. “ Our goal with this trip was to have Asian countries that are large consumers of American energy exports to come see the infrastructure,” he said, “ and the main thing we’re looking to get is people that want to buy Alaskan natural gas.”

While Trump cabinet members were inside the convention center, about 50 people rallied outside with signs that read “We can’t eat money” and “Hands off our public lands.” Several people gave speeches, including Adams of Yukon River Protectors.

“You are not welcome here!” she said as she pointed to the convention center. “And this goes for the people who want to extract all across our state … We don’t want Alaska opened up as a warehouse. We want to protect our lands.”

The dissent wasn’t limited to the sidewalk. Inside the conference, attendees who had arrived to talk about sustainable energy expressed disappointment.

“Listening to Secretary Burgum and Secretary Wright talk about the announcement and the law, it’s clear they have a very one-sided understanding of the history of Alaska and the history of the NPR-A,” said Jackson.

The Interior announcement last week cited the original Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 that created the reserve, and stated that the Biden administration’s 2024 rule conflicts with the original intent of the act. The Biden rule expanded protections of special areas in the western Arctic and also opened up avenues to expand current protected areas and create new ones. It limited future oil and gas leasing and industrial development in certain areas that are “collectively known for their globally significant intact habitat for wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds.”

The original act was as a response to oil shortages and the 1973 Arab oil embargo, but it included provisions for conservation. The original document assured maximum protection to areas with high “surface values,” such as “significant subsistence, recreational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value.” In the following years, it has been amended multiple times, moves that were often met with legal and public opinion opposition. For example, in 2006, the George W. Bush administration tried to open areas to oil and gas, but the lease sale got bogged down by various challenges. The Obama administration granted additional drilling in the reserve and expanded the special areas from approximately 8 million acres to the current 13. In 2020, the Trump administration approved the Willow Project, a controversial ConocoPhillips oil drilling project that was later greenlit by the Biden administration.

“ The ongoing theme is that we’re just selling Alaska,” said Johnson, of the Village of Solomon, “and I think that there’s a lot of inconsideration for the people because this is somebody’s home, in every part of Alaska, and I don’t feel like that’s being considered in any shape or form, and that is scary to me. It’s actually very terrifying.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ASEC_KF_pressconf1-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 06:01:33.544314

In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.” Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports imported biodiesel feedstocks, like used cooking oil, tallow and canola oil have all increased over the past several years due to the high cost of domestic feedstocks.

The news to prioritize domestic feedstocks was welcomed by Iowa Soybean Association President Brent Swart, who said biomass-based diesel supports “roughly 10% of the price per bushel of soybeans.” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said USDA and EPA have “never been more aligned” on the demand for domestically grown biofuels.

‘Femi Awolesi, born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, has embraced big questions and bold answers. Whether standing before a packed room of engineers and policy experts in Raleigh, North Carolina, or examining the lived experiences of communities in the shadow of Louisiana’s industrial corridor, his message has been clear: sustainability must be inclusive, and justice must be at its core.

Earlier this week, June 10, 2025, Awolesi took the stage at the 118th Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Air & Waste Management Association (A&WMA), one of the most respected global gatherings of environmental professionals. His technical session, rooted in original research conducted in southern Louisiana, explored public perceptions of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects—one of the cutting-edge technologies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

But rather than dwelling only on technological advancements, Awolesi challenged the room to examine the social foundations of innovation. “Trust building is important to foster an inclusive energy transition,” he declared. “Trust takes time and effort to build, particularly in a society with a long history of distrust like Louisiana.” These were not just words of theory; they were drawn from months of informal and formal conversations, including stakeholder interviews, focus groups with fence-line communities, and immersive fieldwork in regions historically burdened by environmental injustice.

“Everyone should be a member, not just a number,” he further suggested, emphasizing the need for participatory governance in energy planning. His talk resonated across sectors—receiving positive feedback from attendees after his delivery.

This engagement comes on the heels of another major milestone in Awolesi’s academic journey. On May 28, 2025, he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation in a rigorous two-hour session before a five-member faculty panel at Louisiana State University (LSU). The dissertation, titled “Rethinking Green Building Development Through Policy and Operational Metrics: Insights from Baton Rouge and Beyond,” explores why some cities lag behind in sustainable construction and offers a practical tool—the Operational Sustainability Index (OPSi)—for measuring real-world building performance after certification. The research is already gaining attention in academic circles and policy discussions.

A Scholar’s Rise from Lagos

Awolesi’s intellectual journey began in the bustling suburban area of Lagos, where he attended Hon-Bethel Nursery and Primary School—a private school—and later, Ojodu Junior Grammar School and Babs Fafunwa Millennium Senior Secondary School—both public institutions. It was during these formative years that he cultivated a deep passion for science, communication, and people. He went on to graduate as a top-ranking student in the Faculty of Science at Olabisi Onabanjo University, earning his degree in Industrial Chemistry.

But it was not just academic curiosity that propelled him forward—it was also poverty and purpose: the fear of remaining poor, both mentally and economically; the conviction that science and technology must serve the society from which they arise; and the belief that he could effect real change in his everyday environment.

That belief carried him into graduate research and professional experiences across both Nigeria and the United States. After serving as a research assistant at Landmark University during his National Youth Service Corps (a mandatory post-tertiary program for Nigerian graduates), and later taking on environmental management roles with PAMM Environmental Services in Lagos, he earned a scholarship to pursue advanced studies in the U.S.

Awolesi spent a year at Mississippi State University, conducting research in the Department of Chemistry on Biochar and its applications in soil remediation and wastewater treatment. He later advanced to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he enrolled in a rare and ambitious triple-track graduate program: a PhD in Environmental Sciences, an MS in Construction Management, and a Graduate Certificate in Environmental and Energy Policy. All three credentials are scheduled to be conferred in August 2025—a remarkable achievement accomplished by very few graduate students.

Yet, Awolesi’s academic accomplishments are only part of his story. He has authored or co-authored over 15 peer-reviewed articles, several of which have appeared in leading international journals such as Energy and Built Environment. His published research offers insights that are adaptable to both policy and practice—locally and globally—spanning environments from school campuses to broader urban communities.

A Voice for Environmental Justice

Throughout his research, Awolesi has placed community impact at the forefront. His doctoral work incorporates stakeholder engagement and investigates how public policies can be restructured to make green building development widespread, especially in underserved cities like Baton Rouge. He strongly advocates for an inclusive energy transition and has developed a conceptual framework to clarify this approach, emphasizing the pillars of justice, education, and active participation.

“Energy literacy is about moving from being a consumer as community citizens, but rather being a prosumer by being involved in the dialogues that matter with regard to energy innovation,” he stated in effect during his A&WMA presentation.

Beyond the classroom and research lab, Awolesi has volunteered with the Louisiana State University Industrial Assessment Center, a program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. In this role, he has conducted sustainability audits for industrial facilities across Louisiana, helping companies identify pathways to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.

“Urban sustainability cannot be attained without factor measurement, evaluation, and control,” he noted in a LinkedIn post following an energy and sustainability assessment conducted at Louisiana Fish Fry Products in Baton Rouge.

Recognition and Global Reach

Awolesi’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. He has received several prestigious awards for sustainability research, including the IFMA Fellows Scholarship and the A&WMA Sustainability Research Related to Waste Management Scholarship—two of the most competitive honors available to emerging scholars and professionals in the field. He was also recently inducted into Phi Kappa Phi, one of America’s oldest and most selective academic honor societies.

During the Honors and Awards Ceremony at the conclusion of A&WMA’s four-day conference in Raleigh, Awolesi was named runner-up for the Young Professional Best Paper Award in the Industry, Power, Government, and Indigenous (IPGI) Sectors Group. The award recognizes outstanding technical contributions from young professionals, defined as those 35 years old or younger, based on the submission and peer review of a full-length paper or extended abstract.

Beyond accolades, Awolesi continues to pay it forward. As part of LSU’s academic outreach, he has co-designed and facilitated workshops for high school students in environmental justice communities—teaching them how to monitor air pollution, analyze environmental data, and communicate findings to local officials.

“There’s no progress without people,” he affirms. “The most brilliant idea means nothing if it can’t be communicated, understood, and trusted by the communities it is meant to serve.”

From the lecture theatres of Olabisi Onabanjo University to international stages and scholarly journals, ‘Femi Awolesi is building more than a career—he is building a legacy of equity-driven innovation. “And it all began in Lagos,” he reflects, “where I learned that we don’t just inherit history—we shape it.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screenshot_20250614-085636.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:11:45.687700

Solar energy doesn't produce air pollution or release planet-warming gases like other forms of power. It is also one of the best ways to save money on your home's electricity bill, as OP demonstrated with their monthly bill.

While the cost of installing solar panels could be high, it doesn't take long to break even. According to EnergySage, solar begins paying for itself after about 7.1 years.

Tax credits and rebates, like the Inflation Reduction Act, can also knock down the initial costs of installing solar. With the Residential Clean Energy Credit, homeowners can save up to 30% on a new solar installation.

Help Grow Congressional Support for Museums

Earlier this year, the Congressional Museum Caucus was created by co-chairs Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY) and Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH). AAM advocated for the creation of the caucus, which is made up of members of the House of Representatives. The goal of the caucus is to help raise awareness within Congress of issues impacting museums.

Action: Ask your House member to show their support for museums by joining the bipartisan Congressional Museum Caucus. We strongly recommend editing the draft letter below, sharing why museums are important to you and to your community.

If you attended Museums Advocacy Day, please reach out to the staff person that you met with to follow up on the request for the House member to join the caucus.

Tax Policy Legislation

Last month, the House passed a sweeping tax package. The Senate is currently working on its own version, and details have yet to be released. Eventually, the House and Senate will need to come to an agreement to resolve the differences between the two versions.

The House bill would reinstate a modest non-itemizer deduction for tax years 2025-2028 at $150 for single taxpayers and $300 for married taxpayers. While this is a step in the right direction, this provision is not as strong as those in the Charitable Act (S. 317/H.R. 801), one of AAM’s top legislative priorities. The deduction would allow the more than 90% of taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct charitable gifts.

The House bill also contains troubling provisions for nonprofit charitable organizations, including museums. We oppose several of the House bill’s provisions, including expanding the excise tax on investment income of university endowments, which could impact resources for college and university museums and galleries, and increasing the foundation excise tax thus reducing availability of grant funds.

AAM is working with our coalition partners in the Charitable Giving Coalition, Independent Sector, National Council of Nonprofits, and the Community Impact Coalition to protect and advance the interests of museums, preserve and expand the charitable deduction, and defeat anti-charity provisions.

FY26 Appropriations

The President released his full Budget for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26), which included the elimination of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Please note, the president’s budget is just a proposal. Congress sets the spending limits for the agencies.

Congress has begun the Appropriations process to fund the federal government for FY26.

Thank you to everyone who contacted their members of Congress to encourage them to support IMLS funding in FY26. View the final letters and signers for the Senate and House. Note, some members of Congress who serve on the Appropriations Committee, the committee that writes the funding bills, often do not sign onto these letters as they would essentially be sending the letters to themselves.

The House Appropriations Committee released its schedule for consideration of their versions of the FY26 Appropriations Bills. Of note:

Subcommittee consideration of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill (Interior) will be on June 23, with full committee consideration on June 26. The Interior bill includes agencies such as the NEA, NEH, and the National Park Service (NPS).

Subcommittee consideration for the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill (LHHS) will be on July 21, with full committee consideration on July 24. The LHHS bill includes IMLS.

AAM’s President and CEO Marilyn Jackson provided written testimony to the House Appropriations Committee:

Support of funding for the IMLS Office of Museums Services

Support of funding NEH, NEA, Smithsonian Institution, and Historic Preservation Programs

The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet released its schedule for consideration of the Appropriations bills.

Rescissions Package

The President sent a Rescissions Package to Congress. A Rescissions Package proposes cuts from current spending (in this case, FY25) that Congress would need to vote on to approve. Congress has 45 days to consider the package, or the funding remains where Congress originally intended. The House passed the package this week. The Senate has not yet considered the package. The IMLS, NEH, and NEA funding cuts were not included in the President’s Rescissions Package but could be included in potential future packages. AAM will continue to monitor these developments closely. If those funding cuts are sent to Congress and they approve them, it would take away a key argument in the lawsuits that the President cannot eliminate the agency and not use the funding appropriated to the agency without Congressional approval.

The relatively young brand, part of Geely, is the latest automaker from China to launch sales in the Europe amid a still-lukewarm amount of interest in the commercial van segment.

Last-mile electric delivery van startups are almost all gone with established automakers remaining, but landing large orders is still proving difficult.

While Chinese car brands appear unlikely to land in the US anytime soon, the same is not true across the Atlantic, with a growing variety of passenger and commercial models now available to buyers in Europe in every price category.

Farizon is far from a being a household name across the pond, but at the moment the brand isn't even the only van from China that's now available in the UK. That's a big change from just a few years ago.

Eager to capture a slice of the elusive but constantly just-over-the-next-hill commercial and last-mile delivery market before it fills up with local competitors, Farizon's SuperVan, or SV, is aimed at a vast variety of familiar customers that, to date, have mostly been using vans powered by rather tiny diesel engines.

With the electrification of the commercial van segment gaining some modest traction after plenty of false starts, Farizon is opening a flagship dealership in London's Park Royal industrial area.

The vans themselves offer a choice of three batteries, in 67-kWh, 83-kWh, and 106-kWh flavors, in a total of eight variants, ranging from 177 to 247 miles in the combined WLTP cycle, and a maximum urban range of 342 miles.

With payloads of up to 3,064 lbs and a maximum 4,409-lb towing capacity, the vans promise commercial users plenty of versatility, with the largest variant featuring 459 cubic feet of interior space.

The two smaller battery packs are lithium iron phosphate (LFP) units, meant to keep costs down, while the largest 106-kWh pack is an NMC battery.

Farizon's vans have begun arriving in the UK in recent months.

The vans start at $54,000 for the L1 H1 model with Jameel Motors UK, a leading commercial vehicle dealer, set to offer the vans along with providing aftersales support.

Meanwhile, logistics giant DHL is slated to help coordinate the brand's launch.

""Setting up an entirely new operation is a significant undertaking. By giving Farizon a ready-made network and access to the highest level of automotive logistics expertise, we're enabling seamless market entry,"" said Paul Stone, MD Manufacturing Logistics, DHL Supply Chain.

Farizon is the latest in a string of successful launches of Chinese-produced brands in Europe, but it's also targeting a vehicle category that has been resistant to big changes.

If Farizon's launch in the UK reflects one other particular trend, it's the one where it's the more established automakers that have actually made it into mass production when it comes to commercial EVs, rather than cottage industry startups that had attracted a lot of attention starting a decade ago.

Most of those startups are now gone, having succumbed to typical startup cashflow issues, while the larger automakers are slowly trying to get buyers large and small interested in their wares.

Concerns over charging infrastructure certainly play a role in the rate of commercial EV adoption, especially for small businesses. But there are other barriers as well in this sphere, including the high costs of some of the available models.

Finding large fleet buyers has always been one of the first steps in the launch of a new commercial model. But this hasn't been as easy in the age of electrification, with few automakers taking the risk.

Farizon itself was launched only in 2016 and it has the backing of Geely Holding Group, which also owns Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, Zeekr, and several other brands.

So it's not a small player—just a relatively new one.

One of the problems with this segment is that there have been only a handful of large fleet buyers to court among the early adopters, including the big retail and logistics companies. Established van makers have quickly maxed out the early wave of orders from these big fleet buyers with some serious effort, but after that, automakers have to convert plumbing businesses and mom-and-pop shops to electric van religion to keep sales going.

At the moment, there is no danger of Farizon appearing stateside to challenge existing EV van makers with the most momentum, including Rivian.

But it is worth noting that the demand for electric vans isn't quite what it was projected to be, with GM's BrightDrop having already taken a few steps back when it comes to production.

Kia, on the other hand, is quite bullish about its PBV lineup, though it also has a much more global audience.

Whether this status quo will change drastically by 2030 remains to be seen, but even getting to 20% of the commercial van market now seems like an overly optimistic estimate for the end of the decade.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/farizon-sv-684c4adb8c5d0.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.706xh;0,0.271xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-14 15:05:50.514332

The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act.","President Donald Trump on yesterday signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.

The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state's zero-emission car phaseout ""has been a disaster for this country.""

Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.

Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.

""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Thursday.

Ten other states that are enforcing California's emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Newsom on Thursday also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state's commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.

Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California's emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks ""regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law."" And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.

Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.

Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..

Trump said his actions mean those rules ""are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.""

""Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation,"" he wrote. (California's mandate applies only to vehicles sold in the state; the other states agreed to enact the same rules.)",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c9fc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F84%2F41c3b08a422ca6dc035ac5b30e0a%2Fcalifornia-sues-trump-blocking-clean-air-rules-cars.JPEG,N,,2025-06-14 05:01:29.961675

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade. The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein. The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners. JetZero has said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027. United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production. Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903. “North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.” The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives. State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met. A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures. A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states. JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus. “We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.” While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles. The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero. JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared. “It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said. Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets. The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County. North Carolina’s previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.

Australia allows emissions reporting for biomethane, H2

Sydney, 13 June (Argus) — The Australian government will enable companies to report scope 1 emissions from the consumption of biomethane and hydrogen, which will need to be backed by eligible renewable gas certificates, it announced today. Companies will be able to prove that the gas they receive from the natural gas network and consume in a reporting year contains an amount of renewable gas, as represented by renewable gas certificates retired or completed by them or on their behalf, adjusted for losses, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) said on 13 June. The new product guarantee of origin (PGO) certificates registered under the guarantee of origin (GO) scheme, as well as the renewable gas guarantee of origin (RGGO) certificates issued under the GreenPower Renewable Gas Certification (RGC), will both be allowed. Any gas sourced from the natural gas network that is not covered by the new certificate-backed loss-adjusted amount must be reported as natural gas, the DCCEEW said. The changes are part of updates to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme, which is used to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy production and consumption. These are the latest changes following the implementation of the recommendations made at the end of 2023 by Australia's Climate Change Authority (CCA), which reviews the NGER scheme every five years. The market-based reporting allowing companies to report the scope 1 emissions benefits from their renewable gas purchases will start from 1 July 2025, and be applicable from the July 2025-June 2026 financial year onwards. They will affect NGER scheme reports to be submitted by corporations by 31 October 2026. The updates also include amendments to support the reclassification of hydrogen as a fuel type. Hydrogen was previously classified in the NGER scheme as an energy commodity. The DCCEEW will monitor the uptake of biomethane as a feedstock for ammonia and hydrogen production and may revisit some technical rules in future annual NGER scheme updates, it said. Potential impact on oil and gas facilities Other changes announced on 13 June include updates to the emission factors used in two methods for gas flared in oil and natural gas operations. Some submissions to a public consultation raised concerns about the potential overestimation of methane emissions resulting from the assumption that flare gas is 100pc methane, and implications of the proposed emission factors on facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism, the DCCEEW said. The Clean Energy Regulator has the discretion to vary the facility's baseline to accommodate the regulatory change if the revised factors have a material impact on emissions reported by a facility covered by the safeguard mechanism, it said. Facilities under the oil and gas extraction sector received a combined 3.07mn safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) in the July 2023-June 2024 financial year as their covered scope 1 emissions were below their baselines.

UK ETS emissions fell by 11pc on the year in 2024

Seville, 12 June (Argus) — Emissions in sectors covered by the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) declined by 11.5pc year on year in 2024, data published by the UK ETS authority show, slowing their decline slightly from the previous year. Stationary installations covered by the UK ETS emitted 76.7mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), down by 12.9pc from 2023, the data show. But this was offset somewhat by a 2pc increase in aviation emissions to 8.99mn t CO2e. Overall UK ETS emissions now have declined for two consecutive years, having fallen by 12.5pc in 2023. Emissions under the scheme rose by 2.5pc in 2022, as a strong rebound in aviation activity following earlier Covid-19 restrictions outweighed declining stationary emissions. Stationary emissions have decreased in every year since the scheme launched in 2021. The majority of the decline in stationary emissions under the UK ETS last year took place in the power sector, where emissions dropped by 18.2pc to 30.6mn t CO2e. The country's last coal-fired plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in September last year. And the share of gas-fired output in the generation mix dipped as wind, solar and biomass production and electricity imports edged higher. Industrial emissions also declined, by 8.9pc to 46.1mn t CO2e. The iron and steel sector posted the largest relative drop of 30pc to 6.54mn t CO2e. Emissions from crude extraction fell by 6.4pc to 6.0mn t CO2e, while emissions from gas extraction, manufacture and distribution activities decreased by 8.9pc to 5.3mn t CO2e. The chemicals sector emitted 2.28mn t CO2e, down by 5.2pc on the year. A total of 43 installations were marked as having surrendered fewer carbon allowances than their cumulative emissions since the launch of the UK ETS, as of 1 May. A further two installations failed to report their emissions by the deadline. ""Appropriate enforcement action"" will be taken against operators that fail to surrender the required allowances, the UK ETS authority said. Overall greenhouse gas emissions across the UK economy dropped by a smaller 4pc last year, data published by the government in March show. This decline also was driven principally by lower gas and coal use in the power and industry sectors, with smaller declines in transport and agriculture, not covered by the UK ETS, and an increase in buildings emissions, also out of the scheme's scope. Emissions under the EU ETS in 2024 dipped by a projected 4.5pc from a year earlier, based on preliminary data published by the European Commission in April. The UK and EU last month announced that they will ""work towards"" linking the two systems together.

EPA seeks end to power plant CO2, mercury rules

Washington, 11 June (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday proposed the repeal of CO2 and mercury emissions standards for power plants, its latest steps in an effort to undo many of the regulations enacted by President Donald Trump's predecessors The agency said the repeals will help bring about an end to the ""war on much of our domestic energy supply"" waged by previous administrations, while saving consumers money ""We have chosen to both protect the environment and grow the economy,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said. ""There was this false binary choice made before we got here."" Together, the repeals would save more than $1bn/yr for American families, Zeldin said. The standards, finalized last year by EPA during the administration of former president Joe Biden, cover CO2 emissions from existing and new coal-fired power plants and new natural gas-fired units, as well as mercury emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants. At the time, EPA said the CO2 rules will lead to a 90pc reduction in emissions from coal-fired power plants, while it tightened the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for coal- and oil-fired units by 67pc and included new emissions-monitoring requirements. In addition, the MATS for lignite-fired units were tightened by 70pc to put them in line with the standards for other coal plants. The CO2 rule includes standards for new coal and gas units and guidance for existing coal-fired power plants, the latter of which vary by unit type, size and other factors such as whether a power plant provides baseload or backup power. It does not include standards for existing gas-fired generators, which EPA had proposed in 2023 but last year decided to scrap in favor of a ""new, comprehensive approach"". While the CO2 regulation would be fully repealed, Zeldin said the agency is proposing to only undo last year's ""gratuitous"" changes to MATS, such as the new lignite standards. ""If finalized no power plant will be allowed to emit more than they do now or as much as they did one or two years ago,"" he said. In addition to repealing the two Biden regulations, EPA is proposing to undo the Clean Power Plan, developed by the agency during the administration of former president Barack Obama. It would do this in part by reversing a previous agency determination that it could regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, and by also finding that those emissions ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution."" The Clean Power Plan has never been enforced, and the US Supreme Court in 2022 ruled the agency lacked the authority to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants in the way envisioned by that approach. Unlike during Trump's first term, when EPA first sought to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the agency this time around is not proposing any replacement. The previous replacement rule was struck down by the US District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021. The lack of a new rule could make EPA more vulnerable to legal challenges, which are all but certain to be filed by environmental groups and some states. ""This administration is transparently trading American lives for campaign dollars and the support of fossil fuel companies, and Americans ought to be disgusted and outraged that their government has launched an assault on our health and our future,"" Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp said. Zeldin said he was not concerned about any potential litigation. ""I would say with great enthusiasm and excitement for the future, I know we are absolutely going down the right path,"" he said. Coal and electric sector groups cheered EPA's proposal. ""Today's announcement nullifies two of EPA's most consequential air rules, removing deliberately unattainable standards and leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them,"" National Mining Association president Rich Nolan said. EPA in March included the CO2 and mercury rules among 31 Obama and Biden-era regulations and actions it planned to review and potentially repeal. Since then, the White House has identified more than 60 fossil fuel-fired power plants that will have two extra years to comply with the more-stringent MATS, giving them a reprieve while EPA works to formally repeal the regulations. The March announcement also included a reconsideration of the 2009 endangerment finding for GHG emissions, which underpins all of the major climate regulations EPA issued in recent years. ""I don't have anything to announce today as it relates to any proposed rulemaking that may be to come on that topic,"" Zeldin said. EPA will open a 45-day public comment period on each proposed repeal once they are published in the Federal Register .

EIA raises US 2026 renewables outlook

Houston, 11 June (Argus) — The US renewable energy fleet remains on track to provide an increasing portion of the country's total electricity over the next two years, even with some changes in the US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest projections. Renewable energy is on track to supply almost 1.1bn MWh in 2025 and 1.2bn MWh in 2026, enough to account for roughly 25pc and 27pc of all US generation in those years, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook report. The 2025 estimate is less than 1pc lower than the agency's forecast in May, while the 2026 outlook is about 2pc higher. Renewables in 2024 generated almost 948mn MWh, about 23pc of all US generation. EIA attributes the higher share from renewables to projects coming on line through the end of 2026. The agency expects developers to add about 32,500MW of utility-scale solar to the grid this year, which would surpass the record high of 30,000MW in 2024. EIA anticipates about 7,700MW of new capacity from the wind sector this year. Wind capacity in 2024 expanded by about 5,100MW, its lowest showing since 2014. The month-over-month change in the larger renewables outlook corresponds with higher expectations for wind and solar generation next year. Wind farms are now on track to provide about 506mn MWh in 2026, while utility-scale solar farms will generate around 350mn MWh, each about 2pc higher from May's outlook. If the solar projection bears out, it would surpass hydropower in 2025 as the second most prevalent form of renewable generation in the US. In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) territory, EIA expects non-hydropower renewable generators are on pace to supply nearly 179mn MWh in 2025, down by less than 1pc from last month's outlook. But the 216mn MWh now anticipated from the sector in 2026 marks an almost 10pc increase from May's predictions for the Texas grid. EIA's lowered its predictions for non-hydropower renewables in the New York Independent System Operator's footprint by less than 1pc for 2025 and by 4pc for 2026, to 11.5mn MWh and just under 13mn MWh, respectively. Revisions to other regional forecasts were minimal. EIA increased its expectations for non-hydropower renewables in the areas managed by the PJM Interconnection, ISO-New England and Midcontinent Independent System Operator by less than 1pc for both 2025 and 2026. Renewable energy resources for EIA's purposes include conventional hydropower, wind, solar projects larger than 1MW, geothermal and certain forms of biomass.

The proposal increases biomass-based diesel mandates and aims to limit the Renewable Fuel Standard to liquid fuels.

Iowa politicians and agricultural leaders praised the proposal, citing potential benefits for the state's biofuel and agricultural industries.

President Donald Trump's administration is proposing to increase the amounts of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the Friday, June 13 announcement, which proposes to raise the Renewable Volume Obligation levels, a provision that sets specific targets for how much for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels each refiner or importer must blend into gasoline and diesel fuel.

The proposal also includes measures to discourage biofuel imports and calls for limiting the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets an overall target for the portion of renewable fuel in the nation's fuel supply, to liquid fuels, omitting electricity, which the Biden administration had sought to add.

It's expected to be a significant boost for Iowa, the nation's No. 1 producer of ethanol, biodiesel and the corn that is the main feedstock for ethanol. Ethanol production absorbs half of Iowa's annual corn crop, and the state is the No. 2 producer after Illinois of soybeans, the main source of biodiesel.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and member of the Agriculture Committee, praised the proposal.

“Under the Biden administration, five biodiesel plants in Iowa closed or idled in part because RVOs were set too low,"" he said in a statement. ""Today, President Trump and (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) Administrator (Lee) Zeldin turned the ship around, delivering a victory for American energy security and following through on their promise to support American agriculture."" Biofuels lower gas prices, strengthen national security and drive economic growth in rural communities. Today’s announcement is welcome news for Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.”

Grassley's fellow Republican senator from Iowa, Joni Ernst, another member of the Agriculture Committee, also released a statement.

“After Biden blatantly ignored the needs of farmers and biofuel producers, I applaud the Trump administration for getting the RFS back on track with today’s announcement,” Ernst said. “By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America.

Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig also weighed in.

“Iowa leads the nation in ethanol and biodiesel production and our existing infrastructure has the capacity to produce even more home-grown biofuels. Today’s announcement sends a welcome and optimistic growth signal to this important industry,"" Naig, a Republican, said in a statement. ""I strongly support the Administration’s effort to prioritize and incentivize American sourced biofuels and ingredients over foreign fuels and feedstocks, including used cooking oil from China. I am also pleased to see the elimination of the misguided attempt to force Biden’s electric vehicle mandate... into the RFS.""

Here are specifics of the proposal

The EPA in the proposal calls for setting total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. The EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 — a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billions of RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction in imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2025 traded as high as $1.06 each on Friday, up from 88 cents the previous session, traders said.

Biomass-based (D4) credits traded as much as $1.17 each, versus between $1.05 and $1.01 the previous session, traders said.

Lobbying for policy draws together biofuels, oil industries

The oil and biofuel industries, both powerful lobbies in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration's support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA's previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

Biofuel advocates cheered the proposal.

""USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American-grown biofuels,"" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

""The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers,"" said Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper.

This is the most efficient use of a combustion engine, while the electric motors on the axle don't need a massive battery to power them, weigh them down, and cause range anxiety. Now, Toyota is jumping on board the EREV train, with next-gen Toyota Highlander SUVs and Toyota Sienna minivans getting the new tech, likely retrofitted to an old platform.

The Chinese Are Helping Toyota

The news of a future EREV Highlander and Sienna comes from Toyota's current Chinese partnerships, and so far, the EREV development is only confirmed for models coming to that market. Announced at the 2025 GAC Toyota Technology Day, the focus was on models for the Chinese market, but the details were particularly interesting, as slides shown at the event showcased models with familiar looks to the ones here in the US.

The way in which these models will be engineered also piqued attention, as there could be potential crossover into the American market.

The fourth-gen Highlander and fourth-gen Sienna both currently ride on variations of the Japanese automaker's TNGA-K platform, which is expected to get a light update to adopt an EREV powertrain setup. No details of the new Chinese market platform have been announced yet, but this is a different tactic than the one we typically see, where a Chinese platform is used with the badge from a brand like Toyota or Honda applied for prestige. In theory, if the existing TNGA-K platform can be tweaked to accommodate an EREV powertrain, USDM Highlander and Sienna models could adopt the same at some stage.

It's also possible there's a new platform for the US market that hasn't yet been announced. So far, for the US, Toyota has confirmed a three-row electric SUV is in development and will be built in the US. CarBuzz sources previously indicated the strong likelihood that this model would bear the Highlander name, and recent comments from the automaker indicated it was done with the clunky bZ nomenclature and wanted to focus on the names people know and love.

""Over time, what you will see us doing is transitioning away from the bZ naming convention and starting to use more traditional names from our lineup,.""

A new Highlander is reportedly planned for the US market by 2026, with an updated Toyota Grand Highlander model (not sold in China) coming in 2027. Now, the new Sienna is rumored for 2027 as well, though the fifth-gen has so far only been confirmed for China. Considering the sales growth of minivans in the US, we predict some version of the next-gen Sienna will eventually come stateside.

More Toyota Hybrids Coming

Toyota is also reportedly working on a sixth-generation hybrid system. The Toyota fifth-gen series hybrid system underpins models like the Camry, Prius, Corolla, 4Runner, and Tundra. The next-gen system will likely improve efficiency, lighten the motors, enhance power output, and continue as a series-parallel hybrid setup instead of a plug-in one.

Toyota declined to comment on future products for the US market. As for other companies developing EREV tech, they include Ram, Hyundai and Genesis, the Volkswagen Group, BMW, and more. But given tightening emissions legislation combined with a general anti-EV sentiment, we wouldn't be surprised to see more adopt the technology in the near future.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2021-toyota-sienna-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 03:01:08.926579

Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.
Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development.
The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.
“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue.","A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the Biden administration’s approval of a major oil development on Alaska’s North Slope, even though it identified one flaw with the action.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.

Despite one problem that the ruling characterized as “minor,” the approval shall stand, said the majority opinion, written by Judge Ryan D. Nelson.

The ruling allows ConocoPhillips to keep developing Willow, which holds about 600 million barrels of reserves and is slated to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day and be the westernmost operating oil field on the North Slope. And it rejects arguments from environmental and Native plaintiffs who said the BLM approval violated requirements for considering the cumulative and climate impacts of the huge development, impacts to endangered species and other issues.

The identified flaw stems from the BLM’s decision to approve a Willow development plan with three drill pads rather than the five ConocoPhillips had proposed. The scaled-back plan approved in 2023 also required ConocoPhillips to give up leases on about 68,000 acres, almost all of that in the ecologically sensitive Teshekpuk Lake area.

During the environmental study process that led to the approval decision, the BLM had expressed the position that it needed to consider full field development rather than piecemeal development, the ruling said. “And then when it came time to issue the final approval, it never explained whether its adopted alternative satisfied the full field development standard,” the ruling said.

But that was a “at heart, a procedural, not a substantive violation,” the ruling said. The development approval is to remain in place, the decision said. Overturning the approval is “unwarranted because the procedural error was minor and the on-the-ground consequences (of vacating it) would be severe,” the decision said.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Gabriel Sanchez said the flaw was serious enough to justify overturning the permit. “BLM’s errors were more fundamental than simply failing to explain how it applied the full field development standard among the alternatives it reviewed,” he said. The agency wrongly excluded consideration of smaller alternatives when it was deciding whether to allow “the largest domestic oil drilling project on federal public lands,” he said.

Willow has been the subject of heated national debate. The discovery, on federal leases that date as far back as 1999, has inspired other exploration in the area, as well as hopes for state officials for a development renaissance on the North Slope. Oil production in the region is now less than a quarter of the 2 million-barrel-a-day peak hit in 1988.

Environmental activists, however, have described the project as a “climate bomb” that will pour substantial new amounts of planet-heating carbon gases into the atmosphere.

Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development. In 2021, U.S. District Court Sharon Gleason overturned a prior approval of Willow. She ordered the BLM to complete a formal supplemental environmental impact statement to better analyze climate impacts and impacts to threatened polar bears. The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.

ConocoPhillips, which is already well into Willow construction and plans to spend at least $7 billion on development, described Friday’s ruling as good news.

“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue. We recently completed another significant winter construction season, and the project remains on track for first oil in 2029,” company spokesperson Rebecca Boys said by email.

“We look forward to continuing the responsible development of Willow, which will enhance American energy security while expanding local employment opportunities and providing extensive benefits to Alaska Native communities and the State of Alaska.”

Over the past winter season, crews delivered modular structures and worked on road, pad, bridge, work camp and pipeline construction, Boys said.

That work was allowed to proceed because the 9th Circuit Court in December denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a restraining order blocking it.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had mixed responses to Friday’s decision.

Some were highly critical.

“This decision is bad news for the planet and anyone who cares about the impacts of industrialization on communities now and in the future,” Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with the environmental law firm Trustees for Alaska, said in a statement.

“The bureau is required under the law to protect the western Arctic’s sensitive ecosystem and the subsistence users who rely on them. But the agency did not minimize the harm from this project on the Arctic’s people, animals, habitat, and the planet in a real way, in violation of the law. There is too much at stake to gloss over the harm this project will do,” said Psarianos, who is representing some of the plaintiffs.

It will probably be fairly simple for the BLM to address the court-identified flaw, Psarianos said in a follow-up email. The agency could submit a report or a memorandum explaining its reasoning, leaving the approval unaffected, she said.

Other plaintiff representatives portrayed the ruling as a vindication, albeit a partial one.

“Today’s ruling is a significant step forward for Alaska’s North Slope,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for plaintiff Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “We hope that this will push BLM to heed the significant risks that Willow poses and deny it for good. While this should be the final straw for the doomed Willow Project, we will continue fighting to prevent this carbon bomb project from destroying one of our last remaining wild places.”

Eric Engle is board president of Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., had an op-ed published in the June 5 edition of the Parkersburg News and Sentinel titled “Pulling the plug on the EV mandate” that was absolutely farcical.

The first comically absurd aspect of the piece was when Sen. Capito referred to “Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.” When since Jan. 20 of this year have Republicans shown the slightest care or interest in “Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority?”

Capito herself has applauded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and the Trump 2.0 regime’s Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget as they have systematically worked to dismantle the federal civil service. Through executive orders and proclamations written by the Heritage Foundation and the infiltration of virtually all the data the federal government compiles on all Americans by tech bro toddlers, as well as nefarious efforts to put that ill-gotten data into the hands of Peter Thiel’s Palantir, we have seen nothing but careless acquiescence and/or active support for these democracy-destroying blatant violations of the rule of law by Capito and her party colleagues throughout Congress.

For a Trump sycophant like Capito to feign concern for Congress’s ability to act as a coequal branch of government with strong oversight capabilities, irony must indeed be dead. As chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Capito holds great congressional sway. Instead of using it to defend federal employees in her state and their civil service protections and collective bargaining rights — just one example of a positive way her power could be wielded — Capito wants to expend political capital on eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of a waiver for California so all states adopting California clean air standards can also adopt the state’s “Advance Clean Cars II” standard.

As Capito points out, the adoption and implementation of this ACCII standard would mandate that 30% of the nation’s new car market (including all areas of the country who have adopted California’s clean air standards) consist of zero tailpipe emission cars in the next decade. This is fundamentally no different than mandating that new car models had to have seatbelts or states enforcing laws that your brake lights work or states enforcing inspection laws. Tailpipe exhaust is a major air pollution problem and therefore public health issue, as well as the largest contributing factor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

This isn’t about “consumer choice,” as Capito claims. California and the EPA have not been attempting to force consumers to purchase one make or model of a car over another when purchasing a new vehicle. They weren’t the ones who turned the White House lawn into a Tesla lot (Teslas are zero tailpipe emission EVs, by the way). This is about protecting the environment and public health. You know, EPA’s stated mission since it was created.

It’s also about saving consumers money. Research by the Union of Concerned Scientists has shown that the costs of owning an EV are now lower across the country than the costs of owning an internal combustion engine vehicle. EVs are cheaper to charge than gasoline-powered vehicles are to fuel, with the median cost savings on fuel costs being between $700-$800 a year, according to UCS. Maintenance costs for EVs are far lower than for gas-powered vehicles and EV charging ranges are now comparable to or exceed the driving ranges of gas-powered vehicles.

EVs have more torque off the line and just as much, if not more, towing capacity as any gas-or-diesel-powered vehicle. They are built with the same safety specs and cargo and passenger capacities as any gas-powered vehicle. Inflation Reduction Act and other federal and state investments have made the initial purchase of both new and used EVs far more affordable and helped American auto manufacturers meet so much of the demand for new EVs with unionized workforces.

Don’t fall for Capito’s fossil fuels industry-backed propaganda. All that she and her colleagues accomplished by using the Congressional Review Act to strike down this waiver by alleging (falsely) that it was an actual EPA rule is higher new car prices (alongside Trump’s tariff costs), more air pollution over the next decade (and the negative health impacts of that pollution), a worsened global climate crisis and lost American manufacturing jobs (many union jobs) created under the previous administration.

Real Clear Wire

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposed repeal of the Biden-era’s Clean Power Plan 2.0, which ruled that coal-fired and many new natural gas power plants must capture and store over 90% of their carbon emissions by the 2030s—or shut down by 2040. It’s a costly mandate, resting on shaky legal and technical foundations. Americans would be fortunate to have it repealed.

President Biden issued his Clean Power Plan 2.0 after the Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency that President Obama’s Clean Power Plan 1.0 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) statutory authority. The Court’s 2022 decision concluded that the EPA had overstepped by attempting to reshape the nation’s energy grid without clear congressional approval.

In a world where energy security and affordability are paramount, one might assume that when the Supreme Court strikes down a sweeping environmental regulation, the EPA would reconsider its approach. But in Washington, ideology often trumps reason, and undeterred, the Biden administration returned in 2024 with a sequel that EPA now proposes to end.

The Clean Power Plan 1.0 attempted to force states to overhaul their energy systems entirely, compelling them to adopt renewable energy and shutter fossil fuel plants, regardless of local needs or economic consequences.

Its successor, the Clean Power Plan 2.0, imposed an estimated $15 billion in regulatory costs over 20 years, and greater costs through increases in prices of electricity and slower economic growth. EPA argues “that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

Just as Chief Justice John Roberts warned in 2022 that the EPA had claimed “an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion of its regulatory authority,” the EPA was trying to do through regulation with the Clean Power Plan 2.0 what Congress had repeatedly declined to do through legislation.

Fifteen years ago similar legislative proposals—the Waxman-Markey and Kerry-Lieberman bills—failed in the U.S. Congress even when Democrats held strong majorities. That should have signaled to regulators that such sweeping changes lacked democratic legitimacy.

Yet ideology brooks no dissent, and the Biden administration’s Clean Power Plan 2.0 pressed ahead, relying on technologies that are neither commercially viable nor widely demonstrated. Carbon capture and storage, the linchpin of the Biden plan, remains prohibitively expensive and technically uncertain. Hydrogen, another favored solution, is not cost-effective. The EPA’s cost-benefit analysis glossed over these realities, assuming generous tax subsidies and benefits from reduced CO2 emissions would bridge the gap.

The consequences of this regulatory ambition are stark. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned in 2024 that the Biden plan’s disincentives for baseload power would destabilize the electricity grid, increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain’s recent 12-hour blackout offers a cautionary tale: rapid transitions to solar without reliable baseload power can lead to lack of backup power, causing the grid to crash.

Moreover, the Biden plan was regressive. It would raise electricity prices, disproportionately affecting low-income households, farmers, and small businesses. It would also undermine a reliable electricity grid and economic growth. By constraining energy supply and inflating costs, it would drive economic activity and jobs offshore, where goods would be manufactured with coal-fired energy in China.

The dirty secret, which Mr. Zeldin forced into the open, is that the Biden plan would not have helped the climate. The greenhouse gases emitted by the power sector do not significantly affect human health, and moving energy intensive manufacturing overseas where it is made with coal-fired power using older technology would have raised emissions, not lowered them.

There is also a deeper constitutional issue at play. The EPA is misusing its authority under the Clean Air Act to pressure states into adopting policies that lie outside its jurisdiction. The plan’s emissions targets are so stringent that no state has voted them into law.

The Clean Power Plan 2.0 amounts to a form of federal commandeering. States are faced with a loss of a significant portion of their electricity generation capacity, and their manufacturing base, by restructuring their energy systems to align with the EPA’s vision. This is not cooperative federalism; it is coercion.

And it is unnecessary. America’s carbon emissions have declined by about a billion metric tons over the past 15 years without such mandates. This progress has been driven by technological innovation, not federal diktats. Cleaner air and efficient power generation are worthy goals, but they must be pursued within the bounds of the law and with respect for democratic processes.

The lesson from West Virginia v. EPA is clear: transformative policy changes require legislative backing. Agencies cannot conjure sweeping powers from ambiguous statutes. The rule of law demands clarity, accountability, and restraint.

As America grapples to ensure grid reliability, there is a cautionary tale here. The path to a reliable energy future lies not in top-down mandates, but in innovation, cooperation, and respect for the institutions that safeguard our freedoms. Administrator Zeldin should be congratulated.

SB 13 will require school boards to dictate what books are permitted in school libraries and set up a formal process for parents to challenge any titles. Abbott has not yet signed.

“The more that you restrict, the harder it becomes to provide for all the children in the school,” Denton resident and teacher Dana White said. “I think it is very restrictive and not conducive to a productive learning environment.”

According to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, SB 10 has sparked controversy and will require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms. SB 11 would allow school districts to provide students and staff with daily time for prayer and reading of the Bible or other religious texts in public schools. Thus far, neither bill has been signed by Abbott.

SB 10 is similar to a bill passed in Louisiana last year, which was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. The ruling said the law violated the separation between church and state.

“Well, the Ten Commandments in school is about as close to church and state as possible,” Denton resident Patrick Hemmer, 39, said. “Unless we’re going to deem all public schools as Christian, then we should keep religion and school separate.”

On the social and health front, SB 3 was passed but has yet to be signed by Abbott, and includes a ban on THC. The bill would ban consumable hemp products that contain any synthetic cannabinoid, such as delta-8, and create higher fines and possible jail time for offenders.

Abbott has remained silent on whether he will choose to veto or sign the bill into law, leaving the future of hemp products and local businesses uncertain.

“Why try to legalize something, and make a point to do it and then flip flop backwards,” university alum Izaiha Arnold, 22, said. “There’s a smoke shop on every block, I mean you may not agree with weed, but they’re taking away taxes at this point, they’re taking away jobs.”

Also on Abbott’s desk is SB 2, which would raise the homestead exemption for school district property taxes. The bill aims to reduce the tax burden on homeowners, with the state compensating school districts for any lost revenue.

Many bills are currently awaiting final approval. Abbott has until June 22 to sign or veto bills. Those not acted on will automatically become law, with most taking effect on Sept. 1, 2025 or at the beginning of next year.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ntdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/1f/c1f608de-f198-4a2d-b101-f46fde1f5f77/684c5774c4f47.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-14 06:01:30.365064

Here is the abstract from that study: “Ocean acidification has been identified in the Planetary Boundary Framework as a planetary process approaching a boundary that could lead to unacceptable environmental change.
“Because of ocean currents, temperature variations, and other factors, the level of ocean acidification varies throughout the world.","Last Updated on:

This week, the EPA announced its intention not to protect the environment by rolling back the rules put in place by those hated socialists Barack Obama and Joe Biden that limit emissions from thermal generating plants. What this failed administration is saying is simply this — corporations are more important than people. During his inauguration speech in January, the putative president shouted, “We will drill, baby, drill.”

Rest assured, gentle reader, this is not about rolling back pollution rules from power plants. It is about eliminating them. Here is the summary from the EPA’s proposal, which makes its intentions crystal clear:

“In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants. The EPA is proposing that the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires it to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution, as a predicate to regulating GHG emissions from those plants. The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.

“The EPA is also proposing, as an alternative, to repeal a narrower set of requirements that includes the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines.”

The crux of the EPA’s argument is that carbon dioxide emissions from thermal generating stations have decreased from about 5.5 percent of global emissions in 2005 to about 3 percent today. Therefore, reducing those emissions further, as directed by the Biden administration, would have little effect on public health. But CleanTechnica readers, who are all well above average, will note the new proposal form EPA is not about rolling back the standard set by the prior administration. It is about eliminating all restrictions on power plant emissions. If you don’t believe that, go back and read the first sentence of its proposal again.

Support For The EPA Roll Back

Lee Zeldin, the stooge heading the EPA today, crowed, “Rest assured President Trump is the biggest supporter of clean, beautiful coal, EPA is helping pave the way for American energy dominance because energy development underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security.”

According to NPR, Rich Nolan, head of the National Mining Association, added his own endorsement. “We applaud the Trump administration’s work to counter the Biden administration’s direct assault on coal power.” West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey called the proposal “a major victory for West Virginia, our energy producers, and every American who depends on reliable, affordable electricity.” Morrisey’s comment is a swipe at renewables and pays homage to the shibboleth of “baseload power,” a construct that Michael Barnard exposed as antiquated in a recent CleanTechnica article.

Wyoming is the top coal-producing state in America, so naturally its governor, Mark Gordon, embraced the EPA proposal. “Today, I welcome the proposed repeal by the EPA of the so-called Clean Power Plan Version 2 that [EPA] Administrator Lee Zeldin and I have discussed over the past several months, and I encourage him to proceed with it with all due urgency. The lopsided and misguided policies of the Biden administration have already wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s power supply and delayed our progress providing the beautiful clean coal President Donald Trump recognizes as essential to having a reliable, affordable and dispatchable energy supply for our nation.”

Not Everyone Is Thrilled

Not everyone is delighted by the new EPA policy initiative. “These regressive proposals are bad for public health and bad for climate, all to prop up some of the highest polluting power plants in the nation,” Shaun Goho, legal director at Clean Air Task Force, wrote in a statement. “The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that’s poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,” wrote Manish Bapna, CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“As Trump and his EPA continue to shovel dirty old coal down our throats, they’re now adding more toxic heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic to the mix,” said Ryan Maher, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “If these reckless rollbacks are allowed to stand they’ll only fan the flames of extreme heat and wildfires, and they’ll trigger more child deaths, more cancers, more lung diseases, and more heart attacks.”

The EPA And Ocean Acidification

Ryan Maher is not wrong. Fossil fuels are now the official religion of the United States, and many Americans are bowing and praying in support of the movement. The problem, of course, is that in order to do so, they have to reject science. America is on its way back to the good old days when witches were burned at the stake and non-believers were stripped naked, dunked in hot tar, covered in feathers, and ridden out of town on a rail. Travelers of every description are now required to surrender their electronic devices to jackbooted authorities who scrutinize their social media accounts and contacts for any hint that they might harbor thoughts that are not in line with prescribed dogma.

But while America is drinking deeply of the fossil fuel Kool-Aid, things are happening in the environment because of the rising levels of pollution in the atmosphere. Some believe that there is no such thing as too much carbon dioxide. How could that be? Plants need carbon dioxide to grow. That’s true, but as my old Irish grandmother liked to say, there can be too much of a good thing. Water is also essential to life, but too much water can be deadly, as the passengers on the Titanic discovered to their sorrow on April 15, 1912.

When there is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, more of it gets dissolved in the waters of the ocean, which creates carbonic acid. In a study published June 9, 2025, in the journal Global Change Biology, scientists published the results of research conducted on behalf of the European Space Agency, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Global Ocean Monitoring and Observing and Ocean Acidification Programs, NOAA, and the Slovene Research Agency. Here is the abstract from that study:

“Ocean acidification has been identified in the Planetary Boundary Framework as a planetary process approaching a boundary that could lead to unacceptable environmental change. Using revised estimates of pre-industrial aragonite saturation state, state-of-the-art data-model products, including uncertainties and assessing impact on ecological indicators, we improve upon the ocean acidification planetary boundary assessment and demonstrate that by 2020, the average global ocean conditions had already crossed into the uncertainty range of the ocean acidification boundary.

“This analysis was further extended to the subsurface ocean, revealing that up to 60% of the global subsurface ocean (down to 200 m) had crossed that boundary, compared to over 40% of the global surface ocean. These changes result in significant declines in suitable habitats for important calcifying species, including 43% reduction in habitat for tropical and subtropical coral reefs, up to 61% for polar pteropods, and 13% for coastal bivalves. By including these additional considerations, we suggest a revised boundary of 10% reduction from pre-industrial conditions more adequately prevents risk to marine ecosystems and their services; a benchmark which was surpassed by year 2000 across the entire surface ocean.”

Breaching Planetary Boundaries

According to Paul Hormick at Green Dispatch, the idea of planetary boundaries was first proposed in 2009 by a group of climate scientists led by former Stockholm Resilience Center director Johan Rockström. They represent boundaries on global processes affected by human activity. If these limits are crossed, permanent, unacceptable environmental change becomes reality for planet Earth.

Hormick writes: “Ocean acidification is particularly problematic for creatures such as oysters, clams, and sea urchins. The increased acidity makes it difficult for them to form their shells. Corals also have a harder time forming their structures. Creatures such as sea stars have difficulty forming their protective outer layers in acidic oceans.

“Because of ocean currents, temperature variations, and other factors, the level of ocean acidification varies throughout the world. Acidity in tropical regions can be twice that of polar regions. Recent research has also found that acidification is spreading to deeper waters. The authors of this most recent paper extended their inquiry to the subsurface ocean and found that up to 60 percent of the global subsurface waters — down to 600 feet — had crossed the planetary boundary, compared to around 40 percent of the surface oceans.”

We alter the acidity of the ocean at our peril. Billions of people rely on the seas for their sustenance. There is a so-called food chain that starts with phytoplankton. We may believe we would never eat such tiny organisms, but in fact they are the source of all the food that marine animals consume. If you eat tuna, clams, scallops, or mahi mahi, you are benefiting from the abundance of phytoplankton in the ocean. The krill that are the primary source of food for whales depend on phytoplankton as well.

The point is simply this: There is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the proposal by the EPA will add more. The Earth doesn’t care a horse’s patoot about energy dominance. Those who worship in the temple of fossil fuels are making the Earth unfit for human habitation — that’s the long and short of it. That’s something to consider when your government promotes more pollution rather than less.

A Holy War On Science

We are done asking people to spare a thought about their children and grandchildren. That argument clearly carries no weight in the minds of MAGAlomanics. There is only one way to hold polluters in check, and that is by making them pay for the harm they do. Everything else is just empty words and failed hopes. Putting a price on carbon and methane pollution is the only way forward.

We can also throw bums like Lee Zeldin out of government and replace them with people who are not apostles for the fossil fuel companies. These are people who would happily gouge their eyes and pour boiling hot oil in the ears to keep from learning anything about how human activity is altering Nature. If they get their way, lots of people will die prematurely and future generations may never be born. What is astonishing is how comfortable they, and so many others, are with that.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9729_Hunter-Power-Plant-Castle-Dale-Emery-County-Utah._10February2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:08.458111

Shelley Moore Capito believes that some of those credits need to be reviewed or repealed. Mitch Carmichael, a former member of the House of Delegates and state Senate, is the leader of Built for America, a new advocacy organization, urging the Trump administration to not roll back energy tax credits. Carmichael served as state senate president and lieutenant governor from 2017 to the end of 2020, then served under former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., as the first secretary of the new Department of Economic Development until the fall of 2024. During his tenure as a cabinet secretary, Carmichael oversaw the recruitment of several major manufacturers to the state, including the Form Energy grid battery project in Weirton, and the Berkshire Hathaway/Timet titanium melt facility near Ravenswood that will be powered by a solar energy microgrid. Carmichael also serves as a senior advisor for strategic initiative for LG Nova. These projects, along with many others across the nation, are benefiting from energy tax credits within bills signed by former President Joe Biden, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But Carmichael said these tax credits are vital to Trump’s goal to return manufacturing back to the United States. “I’m proud to lead Built for America as Executive Director because the fight to defend the energy tax credits driving America’s manufacturing comeback is one we can’t afford to lose,” Carmichael said. “Built for America is a new organization working to defend the tax credits that are powering America’s manufacturing comeback, creating jobs, and helping America beat China.” Following his inauguration for a second non-consecutive term in January, Trump ordered all federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the 2022 IRA or the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in a 215-214-1 vote, sending it to the U.S. Senate. The bill is a budget and spending reconciliation package which continues the 2017 tax cuts that went into effect during Trump’s first term and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill also includes nearly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts through various methods, including work requirements for Medicaid benefits and the elimination of several tax credits made possible by the IRA. Specifically, the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would eliminate tax breaks and incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen projects, as well as phase out tax credits for consumers purchasing new electric vehicles among other rollbacks. If enacted as the House intended, the rollbacks could end more than $522 billion in investments made possible through the IRA. However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work. “They reward U.S. companies that build here, hire here, and deliver results by putting America first,” Carmichael said. “Unlike mandates…these credits are performance-based and results-driven. They support an all-of-the-above energy approach, empowering innovation in nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and other emerging technologies.” Carmichael also said repealing the tax breaks would benefit companies competing with the U.S. for energy, such as China. Built for America is launching a $2 million ad campaign aimed at swaying Congress and the White House to reconsider some of the proposed cuts. “No one has done more to jumpstart American manufacturing than President Trump, and these credits are aligned with his America First mission,” Carmichael said. “They’re helping us beat China, rebuild the middle class, and power a new era of American industrial strength. That’s a fight worth having. “Repealing these credits would ship jobs and supply chains back to China and hand America’s energy future to our adversaries,” Carmichael continued. “That’s why I’m proud to stand with Built for America and lead this fight.” Capito, R-W.Va., is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA. Speaking to reporters Thursday during a weekly phone call from Capitol Hill. Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases. “Everything was tilted towards clean energy, and it was just incredibly lopsided and incredibly generous, so those need to be scaled back no doubt, and some of them absolutely probably need to be stopped immediately,” Capito said. “Others, I think, need a better transition.” As an example, Capito cited the 45V hydrogen tax credit created by the IRA, which offers incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, with potential payouts up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Capito advocated for regional hydrogen hubs in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including what is now the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub project. “The House put in their bill that in order for you to take advantage of 45V…you have to be under construction by the end of this year,” Capito said. “Well, you and I both know, and I think those at the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub know, that’s impossible. That knocks us out of the game, and I don’t want to see us knocked out of being a leader on a new and promising type of energy production…So, I’ve asked if we can make provisions there.” Once other Senate committees release their reconciliation language, the Senate could begin voting on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill reconciliation package by the end of next week. Capito said Congress needs to get the energy incentives right. “We need to unleash American energy,” Capito said. “The (previous) administration has spent three and a half years trying to cap our American innovation in the energy space and we’re going to open it back up again – one of (Trump’s) main tenants for his presidency…I’m very excited to be able to be a part of that.” Steven Allen Adams can be reached at sadams@newsandsentinel.com.

If finalized, Texas’s Class VI primacy could take effect as early as this calendar year.
Prepare for RRC’s Approach to Community Engagement and Transparency Texas’s proposed Class VI program places emphasis on public outreach and transparency.","On June 9, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed granting the State of Texas primary enforcement authority—commonly referred to as “primacy”—over the permitting and regulation of Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This would authorize the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) to regulate the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) through Class VI wells—an essential component of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure.

If finalized, Texas would become the fifth state to secure such authority, joining North Dakota (2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2023) and West Virginia (2025). (EPA also proposed granting primacy to Arizona in May over all classes of UIC wells, including Class VI.)

EPA-RRC Memorandum of Agreement: A Milestone in Primacy Delegation

On April 29, 2025, EPA Region 6 Regional Administrator Scott Mason and RRC Chairman and Commissioners executed a Memorandum of Agreement Addendum 2 (MOA), a key milestone in the primacy process that signaled the proposed approval was likely imminent. This agreement outlined the operational framework for the delegation of regulatory authority to the RRC, including compliance monitoring and enforcement procedures, community engagement, and information sharing, and EPA’s oversight role and mechanisms in the RRC’s administration of the program. Notably, the MOA included an acknowledgement that all Class VI permits, applications, and other information for Texas-based projects are to be transferred to RRC upon the final primacy determination. Environmental justice measures were not included in the final MOA.

The MOA affirmed that Texas has the technical, legal and administrative capacity to implement the Class VI program in a manner that protects underground sources of drinking water while supporting economic development and innovation in carbon management.

What Class VI Primacy Means for Texas

Class VI wells are designed for the injection of CO₂ into deep geologic formations for permanent sequestration. These wells are regulated under stringent criteria under the SDWA to ensure the protection of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). With primacy, the RRC would be responsible for implementing these safeguards through site characterization requirements, well construction standards, testing and monitoring protocols, and financial assurance mechanisms.

According to its application, the RRC’s decades of experience managing UIC programs leave it well positioned to assume oversight of Class VI wells. The RRC already oversees Class I through V wells, including Class II wells used for oil and gas-related injections. The EPA’s press release underscored the state’s preparedness, stating that “Texas is best positioned to protect its underground sources of drinking water while advancing economic growth and energy dominance.” Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason echoed this view, affirming that Texas “has effectively and reliably administered programs for underground injection wells while protecting drinking water sources for decades,” and expressing confidence that “their success will continue with Class VI wells.”

If the EPA’s proposal is finalized, the RRC will be authorized to issue and enforce permits directly, eliminating the need for federal EPA review and approval. This shift is expected to significantly reduce administrative delays, clear permitting backlogs, and facilitate more rapid investment in and deployment of CCS infrastructure across the state.

Texas has long been a national leader in both fossil energy and emerging clean technologies. With primacy, the state can leverage its geological assets, experienced regulatory institutions and energy workforce to scale CCS projects efficiently and responsibly. Ideally, the result is a nimbler permitting process that supports both emissions reductions and economic growth.

A Step Forward for Cooperative Federalism and State Empowerment

EPA’s proposed approval reflects its ongoing commitment to cooperative federalism and the new Administration’s broader objective of restoring American energy dominance. By granting states primary enforcement authority over geologic carbon sequestration wells, EPA aims to empower qualified state agencies to implement federal environmental programs more efficiently and with greater local adaptability.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the proposal accordingly, stating that “EPA is taking a key step to support cooperative federalism” by which EPA will delegate decision-making authority “to states that have local expertise and understand their water resources, geology, communities, and opportunities for economic growth.”

The announcement drew support from Texas lawmakers. Senator John Cornyn praised the move as a next logical step for a state leading in both energy production and carbon management, noting that state-level control over the permitting process could streamline CCS development and “put Texas in the driver’s seat” for advancing decarbonization efforts. Representatives Dan Crenshaw and August Pfluger echoed these sentiments, pointing to the potential for job creation, emissions reductions, and local control.

Next Steps

EPA is soliciting public comments on the proposed approval. Following the close of this 45-day public comment period, EPA will review and respond to public comments, making any necessary revisions or updates to the proposed rule for final consideration by Zeldin. EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on July 24 at 5 p.m. CST. If finalized, Texas’s Class VI primacy could take effect as early as this calendar year.

Strategic Considerations for Companies Advancing CCS Projects in Texas

With EPA’s proposed approval of Texas’s Class VI primacy and the groundwork laid by the recent EPA-RRC Memorandum of Agreement, stakeholders should begin preparing now for the regulatory and operational shift that primacy will bring. Key considerations include:

Participate in and Monitor the Public Comment Process

The outcome of the public comment period may shape the scope and timeline for finalizing Texas’s primacy. Companies should evaluate the proposed approval and RRC’s regulatory framework, submit comments where appropriate, and engage with regulators to ensure the final rulemaking reflects operational realities. The tone and volume of public feedback may also offer early insights into potential legal or procedural delays.

Recalibrate Project Timelines and Regulatory Strategies

Entities with pending or planned Class VI applications in Texas—particularly those currently before EPA Region 6—should anticipate a possible handoff to the RRC later this year. Developers should revisit permitting timelines, coordinate with counsel to address both state and federal requirements during the transition, and consider whether early strategic engagement with RRC staff can help de-risk the permitting process. Simultaneously, stakeholders should also consider the risk of litigation challenging Texas’s primacy. Similar lawsuits have been brought in other states, such as Louisiana, where environmental groups cited liability waivers and the state’s expertise and resources to manage permitting. Although the Fifth Circuit dismissed that case for lack of standing, the court did not address the merits, potentially leaving the door open to future challenges under different factual circumstances. Any such litigation could introduce uncertainty or delays in the transition timeline.

Prepare for RRC’s Approach to Community Engagement and Transparency

Texas’s proposed Class VI program places emphasis on public outreach and transparency. Developers should plan early for stakeholder engagement, particularly in communities near proposed CCS sites. Early and meaningful engagement strategies, clear documentation, and responsiveness to local concerns will be essential to maintaining momentum under a new regulatory structure.

Assess Long-Term Permitting and Liability Management

Companies should evaluate how Texas’s assumption of enforcement authority will affect long-term monitoring, post-injection site care, and financial assurance requirements. While the core technical criteria are federally defined, state-level implementation could introduce distinct expectations or pathways for compliance. It is also an opportunity to shape how Texas builds out its own enforcement and closure protocols.

Align Internal Compliance and Risk Protocols

With the primacy transition ostensibly on the horizon, internal teams should align now on how to respond to the new permitting framework. This includes tracking rule changes, updating internal compliance procedures, and modeling how Texas-specific processes will influence risk profiles and reporting obligations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15622_1442.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 02:01:44.415130

“We are in a period when we need to be deploying more energy resources,” Vaughan said at a Pennsylvania House Energy Committee hearing on Wednesday.
“Too often, red tape makes it slower, more uncertain and more expensive to build the next generation of energy projects in Pennsylvania,” he said.
Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states that don’t coordinate their energy development statewide, he added.
”What has worked in other states with a similar crisis is a state siting board.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

State lawmakers heard conflicting views this week over whether the state should set up a board that oversees the siting and operation of new electric-generating plants amid national fears that growing demand for electricity will exceed supply.

The Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board, or RESET, would set statewide standards for the selection and use of sites for energy generation and storage. According to a bill, HB 502, that’s backed by the administration of Gov. Josh Shapiro and is now being considered by the state legislature, the board would do so in a way consistent with human health, safety, environmental protection and the efficient use of resources.

If approved, the board would replace what its supporters say is a patchwork of local regulations set by townships, whose power over land use can create delays, add to costs and sometimes results in new power projects being rejected. Local officials often lack the expertise to decide on power-generating projects that may cost $1 billion or more, proponents say.

Opponents fear the panel will usher in more fossil-fuel power plants even as the consequences from climate change mount, both in Pennsylvania and worldwide.

The seven-member board would consist of three secretaries of state agencies, the chair of the state’s Public Utility Commission, representatives of business and the building trades and the chair of the state’s environmental justice advisory board.

Although the bill does not propose that local officials are represented on the board, it requires developers to inform them about reasons for proposing a local site, alternative locations that were considered, environmental impacts and potential benefits to the community. Developers would also have to provide a township with copies of technical reports showing the need for a new power plant or energy-storage facility.

While local input is required by the bill, towns should not prevent energy projects at a time when new capacity is urgently needed in Pennsylvania and across the United States, argued Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a trade group that advocates for clean energy infrastructure in 10 of the 13 states that fall in the territory of regional grid operator PJM Interconnection.

“We are in a period when we need to be deploying more energy resources,” Vaughan said at a Pennsylvania House Energy Committee hearing on Wednesday. “We can’t afford to have good projects get stymied by, not bad faith by localities, but by a myopic view of what a good energy project is. Localities are not bad guys but they are not fundamentally set up to make judgements about energy projects that can be significant at the state or even the regional level.”

Power-hungry data centers are a driving force behind quickly rising energy demand around the country. The urgent need for more power supply means fossil fuels must also be considered, Vaughan said, despite his group’s advocacy for renewables. “I agree that includes all of the above,” he said.

There are about 9 gigawatts of renewables—mostly solar but also wind and battery storage—awaiting PJM approval in Pennsylvania now, but only about 20 percent of that is likely to finally provide power to the grid, according to the historical average, Vaughan said. Lately, the rate has fallen to around 5 percent, partly because some projects are denied by local governments.

“You can be ready to go, but if your locality says no, your project doesn’t materialize,” he said.

Critics say the plan is an unwarranted centralization of power at the state level, erodes local democracy and sidelines the expertise of local officials.

The plan that would give the board power to issue or deny certificates of reliable energy supply without clearly defined environmental standards “enables political favoritism, reduces transparency, and concentrates immense influence in the hands of a few,” according to a statement issued by the environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch and signed by 24 other environmental and civic groups.

The group accused Shapiro, a Democrat, of abandoning campaign promises to be an environmental champion, and said he has instead backed fossil-fuel development. “This is not climate leadership. It’s a corporate giveaway,” the group said, referring to the bill. “At a time when local governments are developing bold climate solutions, this bill cuts them off at the knees.”

Adam Walters, an energy advisor to Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development, testified on behalf of the Shapiro administration in support of the bill. The proposal is part of Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” a multi-pronged energy effort the governor said is designed to lower costs, create jobs, streamline permitting and boost in-state energy production.

Since the mid-19th century, Pennsylvania has been a national energy leader, producing large quantities of oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear power, Walters said. But it is now in danger of losing its lead because of bureaucratic delays and high costs, some of which originate locally, he said.

“Too often, red tape makes it slower, more uncertain and more expensive to build the next generation of energy projects in Pennsylvania,” he said. Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states that don’t coordinate their energy development statewide, he added.

But Brian Rengert, director of government relations with the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors, blamed federal and state permitting delays, supply-chain challenges and construction holdups rather than local deliberations for a slow pace of power development.

The bill would deprive the energy-development process of the expertise of local officials, he said at a committee hearing on Monday. Rengert dismissed the bill’s requirement for developers to consult with local officials as only “checking a box.” He said that required public hearings don’t have to take place in the host municipality, a measure that would limit public attendance.

“HB 502 removes an important check and balance from the development process by local elected officials, who understand the uniqueness of their communities,” he said. “It overrides the careful planning by local governments and strips communities of protections.”

The Texas-based power company Vistra supports the bill because it would streamline permitting and help to create certainty for investors in power projects, said Kathy Dietz, director of development and strategy of the company, which has three gas-fueled and one nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, serving some 200,000 customers.

“Regulatory complexity can add years to the amount of time required to develop a new power plant. In contrast, a stable state regulatory policy can significantly accelerate and de-risk the timeline for a project by providing predictability, clarity and coordination across the development lifecycle,” she said.

Committee vice chair Mandy Steele, a Democrat who is the bill’s lead sponsor, predicted that Pennsylvania’s residents and businesses won’t be able to afford their electric bills unless supply rises to meet demand.

“PJM is telling us that demand is rising and that we have to do something, or we are going to be in a full-grown crisis in Pennsylvania,” Steele said. ”What has worked in other states with a similar crisis is a state siting board. We’ve got to get this done fast.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Josh-Shapiro-Lightning-Plan-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 08:01:31.181282

The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027.
That’s a significant jump from the EPA’s 2025 targets, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.
“For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running.
There are no income eligibility requirements for this program and it closes 180 days from the date of the Governor’s proclamation.","State officials and Iowa’s biofuels industry praised proposed Renewable Fuel Standard volumes for 2026 and 2027 released Friday by the Trump administration, calling the record-setting targets for biomass-based diesel a major win for domestic biodiesel producers.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Friday released its Renewable Fuel Standards draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon level in 2026.

The RFS mandates that U.S. refiners blend a certain amount of renewable fuels into transportation fuels, or buy credits to comply.

The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027. That’s a significant jump from the EPA’s 2025 targets, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.

Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said in a statement the volumes “signal real opportunity for domestic producers, especially here in Iowa, and we appreciate the EPA’s recognition of what this industry is capable of delivering.”

“We thank the Trump administration for recognizing that American-made biofuels should be a national priority, and for setting the stage for today’s historic growth in biomass-based diesel,” Kimberley added. “For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running. That’s good news for jobs, for soybean farmers and for communities that rely on biofuels as a driver of economic growth.”

Iowa Republican U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the EPA announcement.

“I'm very encouraged by the EPA's proposed rule, which underscores the important role that biofuels play in our strategy for American energy dominance,” Hinson said in a statement. “Energy security is national security, and today’s announcement is a win for our biofuels producers and Ag community in Iowa.”

Hinson earlier this year led a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump urging his administration to propose robust blending targets, after several biodiesel plants in the Midwest idled production after former President Joe Biden’s administration failed to issue final guidance on new tax incentives for the next generation of renewable fuels and set biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels volumes below what the industry said was needed to meet actual production capacity.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks.

“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers — they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.”

Naig also called on the administration to clarify that future EPA decisions on small refinery exemptions be done “in a manner that upholds current and future blending targets.”

EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8.

Iowa nonprofits warn of harms caused by Trump tax bill

The Iowa Nonprofit Alliance and 96 other nonprofit organizations from across the state sent a joint letter Thursday to Republican Iowa U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst calling for critical changes to the House-passed budget reconciliation bill.

The letter warns that specific provisions in the bill would harm Iowa communities, particularly in rural Iowa, by cutting access to food, health care and education, and by weakening charitable giving incentives that support local services.

“If these cuts go through, more Iowans will go without food and health care,” Alex Rice, executive director of the Iowa Nonprofit Alliance, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about dollars — it’s about real human consequences.”

The nonprofit groups warn the proposed $1 trillion in reduced spending outlined in the bill would increase food insecurity and jeopardize health coverage for some 730,000 Iowans, and threaten the viability of rural health care providers and grocery stores.

Cuts to Pell Grant funding would block pathways to better jobs, especially in a state already grappling with workforce shortages, the letter warns.

And proposed changes to charitable deductions and new tax burdens on nonprofits would significantly reduce donations and limit critical services at a time of rising community need, the alliance warns.

“Nonprofits are not just service providers — we are employers, community hubs, and often the last line of support for people in crisis,” Rice said. “We ask our senators to stand with Iowa’s communities and the organizations working every day to support them.”

Reynolds issues disaster proclamation for Palo Alto, Osceola counties

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Palo Alto and Osceola counties Friday after the areas experienced severe weather conditions, including wind damage, Tuesday.

The proclamation will allow state resources to be utilized to help areas impacted by severe whether and activates the Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program, which provides grants up to $7,000 for households with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Grants are available for home or car repairs, replacement of personal property or food, and temporary housing expenses. The program application is open for 45 days from the date of the proclamation.

The proclamation also activates the Disaster Case Advocacy Program, which provides support for those who experience disaster-related hardship, injury or adverse conditions. There are no income eligibility requirements for this program and it closes 180 days from the date of the Governor’s proclamation.

APIA, CA, UNITED STATES, June 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Samoa became one of the first Pacific Island nations to adopt a legally binding Marine Spatial Plan — a milestone step to fully protect 30% and ensure sustainable management of 100% of its vast 120,000-square-kilometer ocean territory.

The adoption of the plan under the Lands, Survey and Environment Act 1989 was endorsed by Samoa’s Cabinet, setting a global blueprint for how large ocean states can sustainably manage their ocean and their resources.

Hon. Toeolesulsulu Cedric Pose Salesa Schuster, Samoa’s Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the legal adoption of the plan, stating, “Samoa is a large ocean state, and our way of life is under increased threat from climate change, overfishing, habitat degradation, and much more. This Marine Spatial Plan marks a historic step towards ensuring that our ocean remains prosperous and healthy to support all future generations of Samoans-just as it did for us and our ancestors.”

The Marine Spatial Plan includes the establishment of nine new fully protected Marine Protected Areas, covering 36,000 square kilometers of ocean. It integrates traditional management systems by incorporating existing nearshore community-managed areas such as Fish Reserves and District MPAs, ensuring these culturally important practices are preserved and strengthened.

Traditional knowledge and the best available science together with input from stakeholders and communities from across 185 communities guided and shaped the Plan. Its implementation will be led by the MNRE in close collaborations with other Ministries and national and local stakeholders.

Leilani Duffy-Iosefa, Country Director of Conservation International Samoa, emphasized the importance of Samoa’s legal commitment and the broader implications for global marine governance, “This example shows what true delivery and accountability look like and Conservation International is excited to continue the partnership to support Samoa’s goals to protect 30% and sustainably manage 100% of its ocean.""

Dr. Kathryn Mengerink, Executive Director of the Waitt Institute, acknowledged Samoa’s leadership and the significance of this achievement in the global context, “Today, Samoa has established itself as a leader in sustainable ocean management. We are proud to support Samoa’s visionary leadership and decisive action towards securing a healthy ocean, thriving communities, and a prosperous future for its people and the planet.”

The legal establishment of this Marine Spatial Plan comes ahead of the United Nations Ocean Conference taking place this June in France. The conference, aptly themed “Accelerating action and mobilizing all actors to conserve and sustainably use the ocean,” will provide a platform for Samoa to inspire countries across the globe to advance their ocean protection targets as the deadline for the 30x30 conservation goals rapidly approaches.

The district is leveraging clean energy investment credits specifically for energy storage and plans to reinvest those savings into solar panels to further drive down energy use.
Meanwhile, the surrounding community benefits from taxpayer savings and the creation of high-quality jobs, many of them in Maine’s growing clean energy sector.
“Maine has seen a boom in clean energy jobs,” he says.
“I’ve seen what a large impact a relatively small amount of money can have in a local district,” Howell says.","In school districts across Maine, a quiet transformation is taking place, one that’s improving classroom environments, lowering taxpayer costs and preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow. At the center of this shift are clean energy investments supported by federal tax incentives, which superintendents say are not just good policy, but that they’re also reshaping what’s possible for public education in the state.

For Christopher Howell, Superintendent of Schools for RSU-14, serving Windham and Raymond, energy policy wasn’t exactly a familiar topic. “These tax credits were not in my realm of thought before this project,” he admits. But that changed when his district began construction on a new middle school, the most energy-efficient school ever built in Maine.

By consolidating three outdated schools into one, RSU-14 is creating a state-of-the-art facility that runs on air-source heat pumps and energy storage technology. These systems electrify heating and cooling while reducing long-term operational costs. The district is leveraging clean energy investment credits specifically for energy storage and plans to reinvest those savings into solar panels to further drive down energy use.

“The result is a win for everyone,” Howell says. “We’re lowering the tax burden on our residents, freeing up funds that can be redirected back into the classroom and giving our students a better environment to learn in, with cleaner air and more stable temperatures.”

That ripple effect is no accident. With improved air quality and better temperature control, students and teachers can focus more on learning and less on discomfort. Meanwhile, the surrounding community benefits from taxpayer savings and the creation of high-quality jobs, many of them in Maine’s growing clean energy sector.

But Howell warns that progress could stall if federal incentives are rolled back. “Maine has seen a boom in clean energy jobs,” he says. “If those investments go away, so do the specialized workers.”

Keeping cool for Maine’s classrooms and students

Jeremy Ray, Superintendent of Schools for the Saco, Biddeford and Dayton School Departments, echoes that concern, and brings a personal perspective. “My daughter was in a classroom that reached 96 degrees,” Ray says. “That’s unacceptable, and it’s why we’re acting now.”

His district is replacing four aging elementary schools with two modern, energy-efficient facilities. Thanks to investment tax credits and direct pay provisions, the district will receive approximately $1 million to fund critical energy efficiency upgrades, including expanded solar capacity and high-efficiency lighting.

The projected savings? About $300,000 annually in heating and electricity, which is enough to reduce the local mill rate by 13.5 cents. “That’s money we can put toward retaining staff and avoiding cuts to programming,” Ray explains. “It directly supports student success.”

It also supports the broader community. Ray’s district runs a vocational center that trains students in HVAC, electrical and plumbing, skills that are increasingly in demand due to Maine’s clean energy boom. “We’re preparing students for careers in renewable energy right here in our state,” he says. “If we lose these programs, we lose not only the jobs, but the chance for our kids to build a future here.”

The stakes are local—and high

What both Howell and Ray make clear is that clean energy in schools isn’t abstract. It’s deeply personal. It’s about the air students breathe, the comfort they feel and the opportunities they’ll have when they graduate. It’s also about lowering costs and giving rural Maine communities a level playing field.

“I’ve seen what a large impact a relatively small amount of money can have in a local district,” Howell says. “And I’ve become a champion for these programs because of it.”

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

On Thursday, legislative committees in the Assembly and Senate approved measures related to state energy policies and the overall affordability of energy in New Jersey.

These included a bipartisan measure that cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee to establish a nuclear power advisory commission in New Jersey.

“As demand grows, the state must undertake a serious, science-based evaluation of how nuclear energy can help meet our clean energy goals,” said Sen. Joseph Pennacchio (R-Morris).

Bid to reject electricity auction results

In a different Senate committee, lawmakers approved a resolution urging federal regulators to formally reject the results of a regional electricity pricing auction that has resulted in skyrocketing utility bills for consumers in New Jersey taking effect this month.

“New Jersey families and businesses are now facing higher electric bills because of a capacity auction process that appears rigged against the public interest,” said Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson).

Last week, Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders announced a plan to use more than $400 million to help offset the electricity bill increases, which are estimated to run as high as 20% for some consumers.

Their action comes as many lawmakers are gearing up for a November election where all 80 seats in the Assembly are on the ballot.

‘Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey.’ — Jasmine Metellus, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters

However, compounding concerns about the state’s rising energy bills — and any political implications — is federal legislation that calls for ending federal tax credits for renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen production and nuclear energy among other policy changes.

By some estimates, these federal changes alone could push electricity costs up by nearly 10% by 2030.

Community solar program

At the state level, a bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) calls for revising New Jersey’s community solar energy program, including by updating development targets and eliminating capacity caps.

“The growth that is projected here is exactly the growth that we need,” said Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, while testifying in favor of the legislation moments before it was cleared by members of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

The same bill was also up for consideration in the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee, where it drew praise from Jasmine Metellus from the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

“Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey,” Metellus said.

Concerns about data centers

Meanwhile, the same committee took up a measure that calls for establishing regulations and rates that would be levied on “large load” data centers, defined as consuming 100 megawatts or more of electricity.

As the industrial footprint of data centers expands nationally, including to support artificial intelligence businesses, many states are grappling with how to regulate their huge energy demands in ways that also protect residential consumers.

“If we, in New Jersey, are not proactive in creating a plan, and these guardrails, for addressing the problems that data centers can pose to maintaining an affordable and reliable grid, everyday taxpayers and small businesses will pay the price,” said Assemblyman Dave Bailey (D-Salem).

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030.

The measure received some opposition before the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee ultimately approved it.

Data centers are “the future of economic growth, here in our state, and across the country,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association economic policy research analyst Jack Ramirez told committee members.

He pointed to economic development related to data centers in places like Pennsylvania and Virginia that share the regional energy grid with New Jersey.

Ramirez also warned that higher utility rates for data centers currently up for consideration in New Jersey could “turn away these centers from our state to states with more competitive and better (business) environments.”

Salvation in the ocean?

The same committee also cleared bipartisan legislation calling for additional study by the state Board of Public Utilities of the potential of ocean wave and tidal energy.

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030. The bill, sponsored by Guardian, calls for making New Jersey a “nationwide leader in ocean energy.”

“It’s really an exciting proposition and absolutely worth exploring,” Guardian said.

Among other energy-related legislation advancing on Thursday were those seeking to:

Require electric public utilities to file an annual report with the BPU on recorded votes at meetings of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator serving more than 65 million consumers, across 13 states, including New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.

Require a public utility to annually review its actual revenues collected during the year and its total revenue requirement to determine if it collected excess profits during that year. After any year in which a public utility collected excess profits, the utility would be required to redistribute its excess profits to customers, in a proportional manner and in intervals prescribed by BPU, through a refund mechanism subject to board approval.

The president’s signing of joint resolutions under the Congressional Review Act reverses the Biden administration’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule.
That earlier rule called for requiring 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.
""Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are 'substantially the same' as those disapproved in the joint resolutions,"" Trump said in a statement.
“Our 150,000 small-business members have been saying it all along—electric trucks just aren’t a realistic option right now.","President Donald Trump moved to sever California's EPA waivers by signing a series of joint resolutions Thursday, rolling back the Golden State's strict truck and automotive emissions policies.

The president’s signing of joint resolutions under the Congressional Review Act reverses the Biden administration’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule. That earlier rule called for requiring 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

Another resolution also prevents the state’s low-nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions rule for heavy-duty trucks from being implemented, per a statement by the president. The NOx rule intended to regulate emissions from manufacturers by cutting heavy-duty NOx emissions by 90% and overhaul engine testing procedures.

Trump’s actions also reverses the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of a waiver to California and several states that banned sales of gas powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which was viewed as a welcome move by the automotive industry.

John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said the president deserves credit for repealing EV mandates before they “did real damage to the auto industry in America.”

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” Bozzella said in a statement. “Customers don’t want the government telling them what kind of car to buy. What they want is a range of choices like efficient gas-powered, battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.”

The Trump administration has described his predecessor's environmental policies as overreach and unjustified mandates. Trump said the congressional moves he signed further restrict California from implementing a similar policy in the future.

""Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are 'substantially the same' as those disapproved in the joint resolutions,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Accordingly, the joint resolutions prohibit the EPA from approving future waivers for California that would impose California’s policy goals across the entire country and violate fundamental constitutional principles of federalism, ending the electric vehicle mandate for good,"" the statement said.

In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the federal measures illegal and moved to sue the federal government, seeking to pursue the state's zero-emission vehicle policy. Newsom signed an executive order on Thursday for the state to continue regulation requiring that 100% of sales of new vehicles be zero emission by 2035 for cars, pickup trucks and drayage trucks and by 2045 for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.

Trucking leaders applauded Trump for the measures. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said the news was a big win for both men and women behind the wheel.

“Our 150,000 small-business members have been saying it all along—electric trucks just aren’t a realistic option right now. They’re too expensive, the charging infrastructure isn’t there,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said in an emailed press release to Trucking Dive.

Industry advocates, including the American Trucking Associations and the Washington Trucking Associations, also warned that electric truck technology and charging infrastructure were not caught up to accommodate California's ambitious EV policies.

“We’ve done our part to reduce carbon emissions while keeping America's economy moving,” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear said in a press release. “But what we need is federal leadership to set realistic and achievable national emissions standards. And today brings us one step closer toward that goal,” he added.

Werner Enterprises truck driver Gina Jones shared a similar sentiment, speaking as part of the signing ceremony at the White House.

“We cannot allow one state’s regulations to disrupt our entire nation’s supply chain,” Jones said. “Allowing California to do so would have [negatively] impacted the hundreds of thousands of truck drivers who deliver critical goods across the country each and every day.”

However, electric vehicle advocates view the action as a set back for broader EV adoption as well as improving air quality.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, in a statement said despite Trump’s actions, the nation’s electric vehicle and battery supply chains will continue to grow and spur job creation across the country.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/A-8vDSiBrvZ_9gmm37YuwUDxp5nvH_LqblzQDuYJfpM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5ODIxODE4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:50.846136

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also anticipates declines in U.S. production and lower oil prices as global oil supply grows.
The IEA noted increasing EV use as a major contributing factor among others for declining oil demand.
While falling demand is encouraging for those concerned about the environment, a radical increase in the global oil supply brings its own issues.
“Oil supply must drop down if the world is going to avoid catastrophic climate change.” Oil Growth Now Unrelated to Economy However, Williams-Derry also notes that oil has decoupled from economic growth.","Experts are urging caution after the secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) told delegates to the Global Energy Show Canada that there is no oil peak on the horizon, and that energy demand will increase by 24 percent by 2050.

“The fact is that oil demand keeps rising, hitting new records year on year, is a clear example of what I’m saying,” Haitham al-Ghais said during his keynote address Tuesday, opening the convention in Calgary. “In fact, our projections are that oil demands will go and surpass 120 million barrels a day by 2050.”

Al-Ghais further criticized the International Energy Agency (IEA) for what he termed “flip-flopping” on their projections for future oil demand.

Experts do not share al-Ghais’ optimistic outlook, however.

“Oil producers — OPEC included — clearly have a financial incentive to make bullish claims about growing demand,” said Clark Williams-Derry, energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“OPEC’s forecasting record is mixed at best. For key trends in oil demand, such as EV adoption, OPEC’s forecasts have been consistently terrible,” said Williams-Derry in a statement to DeSmog.

“Long-term oil prices are drifting down in the futures markets — a sign of supply growth outpacing demand,” he added. “The West Texas (WTI) oil price is $65 a barrel today, trending down to $59 a barrel in 2036.”

Williams-Derry noted that the decline is even steeper when adjusted for inflation.

Though in his keynote address al-Ghais claimed OPEC’s projections are not ideological, and evidence-based, he also alternated between dismissing reports that oil demand is falling — particularly those of the IEA — and warning that such reports are dangerous.

“The consequences of this mixed messaging are serious for a capital-intensive industry with long lead times for investments,” al-Ghais noted. “Bodies that are entrusted with guiding policy on global energy affairs should not reverse course every couple of years if they want to remain credible and relevant. OPEC has been consistent in repeatedly stating that inadequate investments in our industry is a dangerous matter.”

Al-Ghais stated oil investment ambivalence was as bad for producers as much as consumers and the wider global economy. His message was well-received by conference delegates, a number of whom — including Alberta Premier Danielle Smith — referenced his statements throughout the conference to support arguments in favour of continued investment in the oil sector.

However, al-Ghais’ optimistic outlook is challenged by OPEC’s own projections: OPEC cut its demand growth forecast in April, citing first quarter 2025 data indicating lower demand for 2025 and 2026 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff war.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also anticipates declines in U.S. production and lower oil prices as global oil supply grows.

Perhaps most significantly, the IEA’s May 2025 Oil Market Report projects demand to slow considerably over the course of this year, from 990,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2025 to 650,000 barrels per day for the rest of the year. The IEA noted increasing EV use as a major contributing factor among others for declining oil demand.

Moreover, the IEA’s report predicts global oil supply will increase by 1.6 million barrels per day to 104.6 million barrels per day on average in 2025. The organization notes demand in OECD countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development — 38 leading advanced industrial economies in North America, East Asia, Oceania, Europe, and Latin America) is projected to decline by 120,000 barrels per day in 2025, and by 240,000 barrels per day in 2026.

While falling demand is encouraging for those concerned about the environment, a radical increase in the global oil supply brings its own issues.

“A 1.6 million barrel per day increase (to global oil supply) is obviously a problem,” said IEEFA’s Williams-Derry in response to questions from DeSmog. “Oil supply must drop down if the world is going to avoid catastrophic climate change.”

Oil Growth Now Unrelated to Economy

However, Williams-Derry also notes that oil has decoupled from economic growth.

“The global economy is expected to grow by 2.8 percent this year, while oil supply is only growing by about 1.5 to 1.6 percent,” he said. “This reinforces a longer-term trend: [the economy and oil demand] no longer move upward in lock step.”

Williams-Derry further notes that the mismatch between supply and demand growth will likely push oil prices down.

“This helps explain why oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in years, and futures markets expect them to continue to fall,” he added.

“It doesn’t do OPEC nations much good if 1.5 percent demand growth requires prices to stay in the $70 range, which is generally too low to support OPEC countries’ fiscal needs for oil revenue.”

Williams-Derry believes this applies to private oil companies too.

“It doesn’t do oil companies much good if oil sales volumes are growing but oil prices are too low to support robust profits,” he said.

Though at the conference, al-Ghais pointed out that OPEC “takes climate matters very seriously,” he also said the world faces an emissions challenge — but not one pertaining to energy sources.

“I’m sure you have all been seeing the recent pushback against the unsustainable rush to unrealistic net-zero targets, and deadlines that were just fixated on deadlines and policy proposals really detached from reality,” al-Ghais told the audience. “We welcome the recent moves towards policies grounded in pragmatic energy realities and that recognize that we face an emissions challenge and not an energy sources challenge.”

Experts have long countered al-Ghais’s ideas. The UN Climate Change organization notes most nations’ climate action plans are insufficient to meet Paris Agreement targets. Climate scientists have also long argued that the quickest way to reducing emissions is to speed up the widespread transition to renewable energy sources.

Unlike al-Gais, Stephen Legault, senior manager of Alberta energy transition with Environmental Defence, doesn’t believe it’s the IEA that has flip-flopped.

He said the IEA has identified what has become the reality for the global energy market. “Starting in 2021, [the IEA was] among the first major industry forecasters to recognize that, due to the devastating impact of climate change on human life, and the global policies put in place to curtail emissions, oil consumption and, consequently, production would decline,” Legault said in a statement to DeSmog.

Legault notes no credible, non-producer-generated, oil-futures forecast exists that doesn’t show oil consumption peaking around 2030, including the IEA.

“OPEC has a vested interest in maintaining a high level of production for its member states, and as a result, appears to be viewing the world through rose-coloured glasses,” he said.

The IEA further expects global oil supply will considerably outpace demand growth, with oil inventories expected to jump by 720,000 barrels per day in 2025, to 930,000 barrels per day in 2026.

“This sets the stage for a further rebalancing of supply and demand fundamentals,” concluded the IEA’s May 2025 Oil Market Report.

“The futures market is anticipating weak demand, abundant supply, and declining prices,” said IEEFA’s Williams-Derry. “That spells trouble for the oil industry’s finances. But you won’t hear that from OPEC. As Upton Sinclair once quipped, ‘It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.’”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OPECchief.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 23:03:46.916983

For vehicles already priced in luxury territory, a $5,000 increase might seem like pocket change to some. But it’s actually a 6% jump, equivalent to adding a year’s worth of insurance premiums or several thousand miles of road trips to your purchase price. That’s real money, even for buyers shopping in this bracket.

What’s driving the higher sticker prices?

Tesla’s justifying the increase with tangible improvements. The Model S Long Range now delivers up to 410 miles per charge, addressing range anxiety, which is one of EV owners’ biggest concerns. New wheel designs, more aerodynamic bodies, upgraded suspension, and better noise cancellation round out the enhancement package.

The Model X also features more space for third-row passengers and cargo.

But here’s what Tesla isn’t saying directly: this move likely reflects broader market dynamics. The company has weathered production challenges, supply chain pressures, and shifting demand patterns. By packaging improvements with a price increase, Tesla’s testing whether its brand power and loyal customer base will absorb higher costs without flinching.

This could signal a new pricing strategy for premium EVs across the board. When the market leader raises prices, competitors often follow suit, especially if buyers prove willing to pay more for incremental improvements.

Where to find better value in EVs

If that extra $5,000 has you reconsidering, you’ve got options worth exploring.

The used Tesla market suddenly looks more attractive. Pre-owned Model S and X vehicles from recent years offer similar technology without the fresh price bump. You’ll sacrifice the latest improvements but could save significantly off new prices while still getting a modern luxury EV.

Competing brands deserve a serious look too. Each brings distinct advantages, including different interior craftsmanship, tech approaches, or value propositions, without Tesla’s recent adjustment.

Consider playing the waiting game as well. Tesla has historically adjusted prices both up and down based on demand. If sales slow after this increase, we might see incentives or price cuts within several months. The company’s done it before, particularly when quarterly sales targets loom.

How to time your purchase strategically

For committed buyers, timing matters more than ever. Federal EV tax credits may apply to these vehicles if you meet certain requirements. But there’s a catch: various price caps and eligibility rules could affect whether you qualify. Check current guidelines before assuming you’ll receive any credits.

If you’re cross-shopping other luxury brands, leverage Tesla’s price increase in negotiations. Dealers for competing brands know about Tesla’s move and might offer better incentives to capture buyers priced out of Tesla’s ecosystem.

Here’s another angle: consider leasing instead of buying. With EVs evolving rapidly and prices fluctuating, a lease lets you enjoy the latest technology without committing to long-term ownership during this volatile period. You’ll also sidestep concerns about battery degradation and resale values.

Your next move in today’s market

The luxury EV landscape is shifting. Tesla’s $5,000 increase might be the first domino in a series of adjustments across the premium electric segment. But savvy buyers who understand their options can still find value.

Whether you absorb the increase for Tesla’s latest features, pivot to a competitor, or strategically explore the used market, the key is moving with intention rather than impulse.

The worst decision? Rushing into a purchase because you fear more increases coming. The second worst? Waiting indefinitely for the “perfect” moment that might never arrive.

Take time to test drive alternatives, crunch the numbers on used options, and honestly assess whether those new features justify the premium. In a market where a single announcement can shift the price you pay by thousands of dollars, your best defense is flexibility backed by solid research.",https://www.moneytalksnews.com/workers/images/width=1920/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/29174541/shutterstock_1461009344-scaled.jpg?s=2715cb49842f09282672d652d9b91fa34da1aca050320500c6263e3db61e98f4,N,,2025-06-14 02:01:40.359912

Washington, D.C. – Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Jon Husted (R-Ohio), along with Reps. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.), introduced the Nuclear REFUEL Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would simplify licensing requirements for nuclear recycling facilities in order to increase nuclear energy production in the U.S.

“More zero-emission nuclear power can help meet our growing energy demand while strengthening our energy independence and national security. By making it easier to safely recycle spent nuclear fuel, we can reduce nuclear waste, lower energy costs, and further America’s longstanding global leadership in nuclear energy. I’m pleased to co-lead another bipartisan, bicameral nuclear bill to support U.S. clean energy dominance,” said Whitehouse.

“Ohioans need reliable and affordable energy sources, and America’s national and economic security depends on onshoring and expanding energy production. The Nuclear REFUEL Act would inject additional sustainable energy options into our economy by expanding clean nuclear energy production here at home. I am proud to lead this bill because it would give our homes and businesses more of those choices,” said Husted.

“It’s important that we make it easier to produce more energy in this country—not less. The Nuclear REFUEL Act will streamline nuclear regulatory licensing and increase investment of nuclear energy right here in the United States, helping to unleash American energy. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan solution with my colleague, Rep. Peters, so we can get back on track to establishing American energy dominance,” said Latta.

“We must find a way to recycle nuclear fuel to reduce nuclear waste and make nuclear power more economically viable. Right now, nuclear operators are not allowed to recycle and reuse spent fuel responsibly, but our bill will change that by creating a regulatory pathway to allow the practice. While we work toward a permanent long-term solution to nuclear waste storage and disposal, proposals like this will help us safely utilize nuclear waste,” said Peters.

“With this bill, Congress is stepping up in a bipartisan way to provide solutions for fuel availability for advanced reactors and for used fuel management. This helps accelerate the deployment and adoption of clean energy powered by advanced fission technologies. The changes proposed in this legislation will facilitate efficient NRC licensing for facilities that recycle used nuclear fuel and produce fuel for advanced reactors. Domestic recycling of used nuclear fuel also enhances the supply chain resilience and security of nuclear fuel for advanced nuclear power plants, like Oklo's powerhouse, securing America’s future of clean energy abundance,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo Inc.

“For decades, the United States government has failed to provide a meaningful solution for what to do with spent nuclear fuel. Technology currently exists to recycle the roughly 95% of spent nuclear fuel’s remaining energy generation capability to refuel nuclear reactors, and as a country we should do so. Recycling will help secure our domestic nuclear fuel supply and help alleviate the massive cost that onsite storage has burdened American taxpayers with for far too long. USNIC commends Senator Husted for introducing the Nuclear REFUEL Act and encourages the [S]enate to act swiftly to move this legislation forward,” said the United States Nuclear Industry Council.

Background:

Nuclear fuel recycling technology, known as pyroprocessing, creates a uranium- transuranic (U/TRU) fuel. Advanced reactors can use this fuel to generate electricity, which reduces the waste that accumulates after energy plants consume nuclear fuel.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) policies do not provide a clear regulatory pathway for how the NRC should license recycling facilities. The NRC can license such facilities under 10 CFR Part 50 or 10 CFR Part 70.

Part 50 is used for licensing nuclear reactors but does not address the process of recycling nuclear fuel. Part 70 involves a single-step, quicker licensing process designed for fuel cycle facilities. In particular, Part 70 governs how uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication facilities become licensed. Licensing recycling facilities under Part 70 would make the process of recycling U/TRU fuel more efficient, as this licensing process would eliminate extra steps and thereby streamline the practice of nuclear recycling.

The Nuclear REFUEL Act would deliver legislative clarity for licensing plants that can recycle U/TRU fuel by bringing them under the authority of Part 70. As a result, the bill would increase America’s speed of recycling and ability to recycle nuclear fuel and equip the economy with additional sustainable energy options.",https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File_id=9D6334F6-3E6F-42C5-A38E-6EF5A3792389,N,,2025-06-14 09:04:18.373644

Democratic Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin was the sole Democrat who voted for it.

Tim Minotas is deputy legislative and political director with the Michigan Sierra Club. He said Slotkin's vote is disappointing.

Thirteen states, plus Washington, D.C., were following California's push to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.

""To vote to undermine these crucial programs can very well exacerbate asthma and cancer in front line communities,"" he said, ""and risk investments and jobs in the clean transportation industry — and cede global leadership to China and other countries.""

The resolution initially had the support of some other Democratic senators, but they voted no after the Senate pushed the resolution through using the Congressional Review Act, or CRA. It allows the House and Senate to reject some agency-finalized rules within 60 business days of their being notified.

California has had its EPA waiver for many years.

Slotkin said while she voted for the resolution, she was concerned about future abuses of the CRA.

""Unfortunately, the way Senate Republicans brought this vote to the floor will have longstanding implications for how we change and make laws in the U.S. Senate. That is why I voted at least 11 times against the Republican attempts to change the Senate rules and bring this provision to the floor.""

Slotkin said her vote reflected her special responsibility, as Michigan's U.S. Senator, to stand up for the more than 1 million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.

She noted that none of the 13 states were anywhere close to meeting California's stricter emissions standards — but she still favors policies to support electric vehicle manufacturing.

Minotas said despite his group's disappointment in Slotkin's vote, going forward, Slotkin has another chance to support electric vehicles and clean energy in the federal budget negotiations in the Senate. Many EV-related grants and tax credits, both corporate and individual, were eliminated in the House version of the budget.

NSP Commends EPA Proposal for Record Biofuel Volumes, Enhanced Focus on U.S. Agriculture

WASHINGTON (June 13, 2025) — National Sorghum Producers today voiced strong support for the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. The proposal, marking the 20th anniversary of the RFS, calls for the highest total renewable fuel blending obligations ever and underscores a renewed focus on domestic energy security and agricultural markets.

The EPA’s proposal sets total renewable fuel requirements at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027. Conventional ethanol remains at 15 billion gallons annually, while advanced biofuel targets rise sharply to 9.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 9.46 billion gallons in 2027. The rule also includes structural changes aimed at reducing reliance on foreign feedstocks and better aligning the program with U.S. production capacity.

“The EPA’s proposal sends a strong market signal that prioritizes rural economies and sustainable fuel solutions made here at home,” NSP CEO Tim Lust said. “Sorghum continues to gain traction as a dependable, low-input advanced biofuel feedstock, and this rule lays important groundwork to expand our role in current and future advanced biofuel markets. We look forward to working with EPA and USDA to ensure the final rule promotes fair access and recognizes sorghum’s value across the advanced and conventional fuel space.”

The rule also proposes reducing the value of RINs generated from foreign biofuels and feedstocks to 50 percent of their domestic equivalents, a move intended to bolster American biofuel investment and reduce dependence on foreign oil by as much as 150,000 barrels per day, according to EPA estimates.

NSP supports the removal of renewable electricity (eRINs) from the program and continues to advocate for accurate lifecycle emissions modeling and improved market access for low-carbon sorghum-based ethanol and advanced biofuels.

EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on July 8, with public comments due by August 8.

In short:

In Colorado, Chevron’s oil well blowout near an elementary school exposed gaps in fracking chemical disclosures, with over 30 million pounds of “trade secret” chemicals injected statewide despite a 2022 transparency law.

In Louisiana, a new law threatens massive fines for community groups that publicly share air pollution data unless they use costly, state-approved equipment, prompting a federal lawsuit.

In Virginia’s booming data center corridor, tech companies use non-disclosure agreements with local officials to keep energy use and environmental impacts hidden, complicating public accountability and regulation.

Key quote:

“How many data centers currently exist in Virginia? How many proposals are in the works? These are good questions. It’s also extremely difficult to provide an answer, given there is no publicly available dataset or state-level tracking of these facilities.”

— The Piedmont Environmental Council, which attempts to track known data center projects in the state

Why this matters:

This is what environmental deregulation looks like in practice: a patchwork of laws that silence watchdogs and hide harm. While the federal government shrinks from its role, the fight for clean air and public data has become hyperlocal — and deeply unequal. Pollution data secrecy leaves families, first responders, and communities exposed to hidden environmental health risks, especially in frontline areas like Cancer Alley.

What matters most is that Africa’s energy transition reflects the continent’s realities, resources, and aspirations, not the preferences of financiers in faraway boardrooms.","This article was originally published by Project Drawdown. Read the original post here.

Africa is home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population, but accounts for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

It is a continent of paradoxes: rich in renewable energy resources but plagued by energy poverty; endowed with critical minerals but facing capital flight; courted as a climate partner but chronically underfunded when it comes to implementing solutions. As the world races toward net-zero, the question is no longer whether Africa will transition, but rather what that transition will look like, who will pay for it, and how it can be made truly fair.

Let’s explore the financing landscape shaping Africa’s energy transition by examining how things currently work, where they fall short, the actors involved, the structural barriers that persist, and the systemic changes needed to unlock a just and development-focused energy future. Understanding these interwoven dimensions can help in imagining a financing framework that supports Africa’s climate goals without sacrificing its development ambitions.

A tale of two realities

Today, Africa exists in a separate climate reality from that of the Global North. High-income countries are phasing out coal plants, banning internal combustion engines, and building out renewables at record speeds. Meanwhile, about 600 million Africans still live without access to electricity, and nearly 1 billion rely on wood, charcoal, and other forms of traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Indoor air pollution from traditional stoves causes over 600,000 premature deaths annually across the continent.

Africa’s energy transition is therefore about more than decarbonization. It is about escaping a developmental deadlock. It is about powering homes, hospitals, schools, farms, and industries. Yet the continent faces an uphill climb to achieve these goals while adhering to global expectations of carbon neutrality by mid-century. Meeting Africa’s energy and climate objectives will require more than doubling current energy investments of US$90 billion by 2030, with nearly two-thirds directed toward clean energy.

The problem with the current financing paradigm

The climate finance currently flowing to Africa is neither adequate, accessible, nor appropriate. Globally, Africa receives just about 2% of total climate finance, highlighting a significant gap in funding relative to other regions. Moreover, most of this funding is in the form of loans, not grants, further burdening countries already facing debt distress. Many multilateral development banks (MDBs) and climate funds prioritize risk-averse, commercially viable projects. This often means favoring large-scale solar and wind farms in politically stable African countries, while ignoring the urgent need to finance rural electrification and productive energy use projects in fragile African states.

The very architecture of global finance is skewed. African countries pay higher interest rates than countries in some other world regions, even with similar credit histories. This is due to structural biases in credit ratings, risk perceptions, and the lack of hedging instruments to manage currency risk. As a result, a solar project in Nigeria could cost three times more to finance than an identical one in Madrid. Furthermore, energy finance in Africa is rarely development-focused. Too often, it is shaped by donor priorities or corporate returns rather than African needs. This leads to skewed investment portfolios; lots of money for so-called climate mitigation projects, little money for productive energy use or climate-adaptation and resilience infrastructure.

Principles for a fair energy transition

To correct these imbalances, the global community must adopt a new financing framework rooted in justice, partnership, and pragmatism. Three principles, in particular, could guide this effort:

Development-centered decarbonization: Africa’s energy transition must be about powering growth, not just reducing emissions. Financing clean energy for job creation, food security, industrialization, and public services should be treated as more than climate action. After all, sustainable development is the best form of climate resilience.

Equity in burden sharing: High-emitting countries must bear a larger share of the financing responsibility. This is not just about historical responsibility; it is also about capability. The Global North has more fiscal space and mature capital markets, and has reaped the benefits of fossil-fueled development. Africa should not be forced to choose between financing clean energy and its own development.

Structural reform, not charity: Africa does not need pity or one-off pledges; it needs a seat at the table and access to fair finance. That means reforming the rules of the global financial system to unlock capital, reduce borrowing costs, and shift more decision-making power to African institutions.

Who pays and how?

Financing Africa’s fair energy transition requires mobilizing funds from multiple sources, domestic and international, public and private, but with new rules of engagement.

Domestic resource mobilization: African countries must lead with credible energy strategies, regulatory reforms, and improved public financial management. In May 2023, Nigeria removed fuel subsidies that had cost around US$10 billion the previous year, four times the health budget. These subsidies were largely poorly targeted and mostly benefited wealthier groups. Public-private partnerships and sovereign green bonds are also growing in popularity. Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa have issued green bonds to fund climate-friendly infrastructure. But the scale remains limited by small capital markets and weak investor confidence.

Multilateral development banks and climate funds: MDBs must do more than lending; they must also lead. This means de-risking investments in Africa through blended finance, offering long-term concessional loans, and investing in upstream infrastructure, such as transmission lines. The African Development Bank has launched innovative instruments like the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) and the Desert to Power initiative. But more needs to be done. The World Bank and others must simplify procedures and align their strategies with African energy access goals.

Carbon markets and global taxation: A share of revenues from global carbon taxes, aviation levies, or carbon border adjustment mechanisms could be earmarked for African countries. If wealthy countries tax carbon-intensive imports from Africa, those revenues should be reinvested in just transition investments within the exporting African countries.

Private sector investment on fairer terms: Private capital is essential, but it must be patient, pro-poor, and fit for purpose. Current returns expectations and risk aversion exclude too many impactful projects. Blended finance, credit guarantees, and currency hedging facilities can reduce risk and attract investors. Initiatives like the African Guarantee Fund and the Alliance for African Multilateral Financial Institutions must be scaled. Additionally, development finance institutions should stop crowding out local capital and start empowering African financial intermediaries.

Loss-and-damage and reparative finance: At COP28, the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund marked a breakthrough. Though still underfunded, it sets a precedent: the Global North owes a climate debt to the Global South. Financing Africa’s energy transition should be part of that moral obligation; not just mitigation, but redress.

Structural barriers beyond money

Finance is only part of the equation. A fair energy transition in Africa also requires fixing systemic bottlenecks that prevent money from flowing into the continent.

Lowering the cost of capital: Africa’s high cost of capital is driven by risk perceptions, weak credit ratings, and currency volatility. Global institutions must support efforts to improve creditworthiness, expand risk insurance schemes, and localize capital markets.

Strengthening institutions and capacity: Weak utilities, slow permitting processes, and a lack of bankable project pipelines often stall progress. Capacity-building at the national, local, and project levels is essential.

Promoting regional integration: Africa’s power systems are highly fragmented. Regional integration through initiatives like the West Africa Power Pool or the Eastern Africa Power Pool can enable economies of scale, reduce redundancies, and expand markets for clean power.

Investing in human capital: A just energy transition must also be a jobs transition. Africa needs engineers, technicians, policy experts, and entrepreneurs to design, install, operate, and maintain clean energy systems. Financing skills development is climate action.

Africa’s right to define its own path

The narrative surrounding Africa’s energy transition must change. It is not about catching up with the Global North or meeting externally set global timelines. It is about building an energy system that is African in design, scale, and purpose. That could mean some instances where natural gas is used as a bridge fuel in select countries. It might mean investing in transmission and local manufacturing instead of imported climate solutions. That’s all a part of the transition, not apart from climate action. What matters most is that Africa’s energy transition reflects the continent’s realities, resources, and aspirations, not the preferences of financiers in faraway boardrooms.

The financing of Africa’s energy transition is not a test of Africa’s capacity; it is a test of global solidarity. To make the energy transition real and fair for Africa, we need bold actions such as canceling climate-related debt, lowering interest rates, shifting control to African institutions, and treating energy access as both a human right and a climate imperative. By following the principles outlined here, rethinking how the transition is financed and who pays, and eliminating structural barriers, the rest of the world can work alongside Africa to usher forth a fair energy transition. The question is no longer whether Africa will transition; it is whether that transition will lead to a better, fairer future.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21091738/AfricaPowerlines_Feature_1b.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 22:02:38.040102

While the Trump administration has taken action to eliminate environmental justice (EJ) programs at the federal level, state programs with EJ laws and policies remain in place and apply to regulated entities.

These state EJ programs remain fully applicable, and as often occurs in the absence of federal actions in a given area, states may increase their EJ activities. Some states have already signaled interest in expanding their EJ activities.

However, the regulated community should be aware of potential tensions between federal law and policy, and state programs. State programs could ultimately be subject to future scrutiny by the Trump administration as has occurred in other areas.

As businesses continue to navigate this dynamic, EJ and other effective means of community engagement remain valuable opportunities to mitigate risks of challenges to project development and build meaningful relationships in the communities in which they operate.

Background and Recent Actions on EJ By the Trump Administration

EJ, historically defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies,” experienced an unprecedented renaissance under the Biden administration. Bipartisan legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) allocation of billions of dollars to advance environmental health in historically overburdened communities compounded this paradigm shift.

However, federal EJ policy—which has never been enshrined in any binding federal authority—is uniquely susceptible to shifting political winds. As demonstrated by the Trump administration’s slew of executive orders (EOs) issued almost immediately upon assuming office, the era of federal prioritization of EJ has been replaced by one in which the federal government has become actively antagonistic to its previous EJ initiatives—and, at times, antagonistic to the regulated community’s approach to EJ. The Trump administration has reversed many prior federal actions on EJ, including through the following actions:

EO 14148, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, which revoked Biden-era EJ EOs expanding the federal government’s commitment to addressing EJ in the context of revoking prior diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives;

EO 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, went a step further, withdrawing the 1994 EO 12898, the first federal action requiring agencies to systematically consider EJ as a part of their respective activities, and, until a few years ago, represented the only express federal EJ authority;

EO 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, directed agencies to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law,” all EJ offices and positions; and,

EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy, instructed agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated under the IRA or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

More recently, the administration released EO 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, which instructs DOJ to repeal or amend all disparate impact regulations derived from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits acts that have an unjustified disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, even without evidence of discriminatory intent. In the context of EJ, claims of “disparate impact” have been used to challenge federal actions such as permitting decisions and uses of federal funding that allegedly have an adverse and disproportionate impact based on race, color, or national origin.

Agencies have moved quickly to implement the EOs. For example, EPA has eliminated its Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, placed 168 employees involved with EJ work on leave (then subsequently reinstated some of them), canceled hundreds of grants designed to fund EJ projects, and removed EJScreen—its hallmark EJ mapping and screening tool that has existed for almost a decade—from its website. In late January, the Department of Energy (DOE) directed the suspension of all initiatives requiring, using, or enforcing community benefits plans designed to direct the benefits from federal investments to workers and communities, including in binding contracts the previous DOE administration had entered into with grantees.

In February, the Department of Justice (DOJ) terminated its Office of Environmental Justice. In one of her first actions as U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi ordered each component of DOJ to confirm the termination of all EJ programs, offices, and jobs by March 15, and rescind all prior EJ policies, directives, and guidance within two days. In April, DOJ terminated its first EJ-focused settlement agreement with the Alabama Department of Public Health and Lowndes County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addressing alleged inequities in access to basic sanitation services. The agreement required the state to, among other things, conduct a comprehensive assessment of appropriate septic and wastewater management systems and suspend the criminal enforcement of sanitation laws where violations were based on a failure to afford basic septic systems. At the same time, the fate of all DOJ and EPA disparate impact regulations under Title VI hang in the balance as the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana—after enjoining EPA and DOJ from these regulations in the state of Louisiana—considers whether or not to vacate the regulations in their entirety.

Implications for the Regulated Community

The reversal of EJ policies, even if somewhat anticipated, nonetheless puts the regulated community—particularly companies operating in states with standalone EJ laws on the books and companies that recently ramped up their EJ efforts in response to Biden-era policies—in a precarious position. States have continued implementing and enforcing their EJ laws and policies. We may see an increase in state EJ activity, NGO advocacy, and litigation in an attempt to fill the void created by the new administration. At the same time, the administration has warned state agencies not to use federal dollars to advance EJ programs. The administration has also set a precedent of threatening to pull—and actually withholding—federal funds from entities that do not comply with its anti-DEI policies—and could do the same with EJ. The administration could also target EJ laws in a similar fashion to its recently-filed challenges to laws in New York and Vermont relating to climate change.

This landscape affords little predictability, certainty, or clarity regarding how the regulated community should act when facing conflicts between state and federal directives on EJ. Ultimately, how the federal government engages with independent state EJ laws remains to be seen. Early signs, however, suggest that the federal government may not impede states from implementing their own independent EJ laws and policies—as long as federal funding is not involved. For example, EPA Region 2 recently upheld a Clean Air Act Title V major source permit issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that contains EJ requirements stemming from New Jersey’s 2020-era landmark EJ law. At the same time, failure to comply with applicable state or local laws and regulations could result in immediate adverse consequences, such as an enforcement response or permit-denial—even as the federal government continues to dismantle EJ programs and policies.

Some situations may present novel questions for businesses operating consistent with state EJ programs. For instance, EO 14173 requires federal contractors to certify that they do not have DEI programs, and DOJ recently launched an enforcement initiative targeting recipients of federal funding that have DEI policies. Could abiding by state EJ mandates implicate this requirement? Or could federal funding, or some other link to federal law (such as a joint federal-state enforcement action) change the applicable legal analysis? The possibility that the federal government may take further steps with respect to state EJ programs may also raise concerns for those participating in such programs.

Electric utilities have cited federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions of toxic metals, for retiring coal power plants.
But they will no longer be forced to shut down coal plants due to federal emissions regulations.
The power plant rules were immediately mired in lawsuits, while the EPA oscillated in imposing the rules between the first Trump and Biden administrations.
“EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute,” the agency said.","by Dustin Bleizeffer, WyoFile

The Trump administration announced Wednesday plans to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxins Standards “that directly result in coal-fired power plants having to shut down,” the federal agency said.

“These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid and limiting American energy prosperity,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a press release Wednesday afternoon.

Wyoming politicians and coal proponents cheered the news.

“Today, I welcome the proposed repeal by the EPA of the so-called Clean Power Plan Version 2 that [EPA] Administrator Lee Zeldin and I have discussed over the past several months, and I encourage him to proceed with it with all due urgency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a prepared statement. “The lopsided and misguided policies of the Biden administration have already wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s power supply and delayed our progress providing the beautiful clean coal President Donald Trump recognizes as essential to having a reliable, affordable and dispatchable energy supply for our nation.”

Wyoming is the nation’s largest coal producer, and more than 90% of the commodity is shipped to coal-burning electric generating plants in the U.S. The state’s coal mining industry has declined precipitously since 2008, while many communities that rely on mining — as well as coal power plants — have struggled to chart an economic future.

Electric utilities have cited federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions of toxic metals, for retiring coal power plants. But they’ve also pointed to cheap natural gas as an alternative at the same facilities and the fact that most coal plants in the nation are simply too old to affordably operate.

If utilities still choose to close down a coal-fired power plant due to aging facilities or to cater to customer preferences for renewables and other cleaner forms of energy, “that’s on them,” EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western told WyoFile. But they will no longer be forced to shut down coal plants due to federal emissions regulations.

“This [repeal] gives those utilities the ability to turn around and say, ‘We now don’t have to deal with the regulations that were putting us in these really difficult situations,’ where they’re having to increase these utility bills by 20%, by 30% you know, which, obviously, we saw in Wyoming,” said Western, a Republican and former Wyoming lawmaker. “These regulated, required shutdowns are no longer a fact. That is a priority of [EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin] and the White House — to ensure that we keep these open. And if [some are] shutting down purely for economic reasons, it’s not because it’s the EPA breathing down their necks and forcing them to introduce early shutdowns.”

The repeal

EPA intends to repeal what’s commonly referred to as the “power plant rules” first established under the Obama administration. The original rules were based on the premise that greenhouse gases that contribute to the climate crisis are a pollutant, and the Obama administration admitted that the more stringent standards would require existing and new coal-fired power plants to employ carbon capture technologies to meet them.

The power plant rules were immediately mired in lawsuits, while the EPA oscillated in imposing the rules between the first Trump and Biden administrations. The U.S. Supreme Court in October declined to halt the EPA rules in the last months of the Biden administration, making Wyoming officials nervous right before the November presidential election.

Now, under President Donald Trump, the EPA is challenging the long-held notion that greenhouse gas emissions from power plants should be considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, according to the agency.

“EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute,” the agency said.

Western added, “The people of Wyoming want affordable, reliable electricity — and they deserve it. Protecting access to low-cost, dependable power ensures families can keep the lights on without breaking the bank.”

The results affirm Hounen Solar’s ability to deliver modules that don’t just meet expectations—but exceed them in the face of extreme weather.

Raising the Bar in Hail Resilience

Hail damage represents a growing concern for PV installations in many U.S. regions, particularly as weather volatility increases. PVEL’s HSS test replicates real-world hail events far beyond standard IEC testing, firing 45 mm ice balls at terminal velocity (30.7 m/s)—each impact transferring more than 20 joules of energy to the module surface.

Hounen Solar’s module emerged from the test with exceptionally low power loss (just 0.57%), no glass or cell fractures, and no electrical failures, such as open circuits or bypass diode damage. Post-test insulation resistance reached 12,916 MΩ·m², substantially outperforming the baseline IEC 61215:2021 standard.

“These results speak to the robustness of our module design and the discipline behind our quality control systems,” said Guo Min, Technical Director at Hounen Solar America. “We’re building more than efficiency—we’re building long-term, high-performance assets.”

Rystad Energy estimates that this growth will continue, predicting an increased installation rate of approximately 16 GW per year by early 2026.

As energy demand rises in the US due to increased electrification, grid resilience will continue to be critical, with batteries playing a key role in meeting this need, along with both traditional and renewable energy sources. The US grid-scale BESS market delivered a very healthy growth of around 60% in 2024, rising from six gigawatts (GW) of capacity added in 2023 to 10 GW of installations. Planned inventory is a very strong leading indicator of actual capacity additions and we believe this rate of growth will create increased annual battery demand for grid-scale BESS

Learn more with Rystad Energy’s Renewables & Power Solution.States that are witnessing the highest levels of BESS market growth are Texas and Arizona, with the California market stabilizing last year. Texas became the largest US BESS market in 2024 and currently exhibits an installation rate of around four GW per annum – similar to California. Contrary to California, the BESS inventory in Texas has increased from five GW to more than seven GW in the last 12 months, pointing to a likely further increase in installations this year.

Notwithstanding the growth in Texas, it is the rest of the country that is currently experiencing a BESS boom. Led by Arizona, the BESS inventory across all emerging US markets grew from three GW in the second quarter of last year to seven GW currently. The actual installation rate currently stands at around three GW – perfectly in line with the inventory level 12 months ago. While some construction delays are expected, there is no doubt that these emerging markets will drive most of the growth in the second half of this year and first half of next year, and even beyond.

In the most mature markets, batteries play an increasingly important role during peak power demand periods as they ‘extend’ solar generation curves into evening hours. In the last 90 days, batteries have satisfied 13% of the power demand of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) during battery discharge hours. Although the trend is new, the days of batteries delivering more than 16% of electricity during discharge hours are becoming increasingly common. While the average contribution during all discharge hours stands at around 13%, the typical peak contribution during discharge hours is already close to 30%. The 90-day average peak hour contribution currently stands at 26%, adding 10 percentage points over the last 12 months.

Looking at the share of CAISO power demand satisfied by renewables – mainly solar, wind and hydro – we observed that the annual average increased from less than 30% in 2021 to more than 40% in the last 12 months. While the peak of renewable contribution in springtime is growing each year – renewables met more than 65% of daily demand on some days this year, for instance – winter dips remain similar, with renewables delivering only 20% to 25% of demand. As a result, renewables integration has to date only been able to reduce CAISO’s dependency on energy imports, which have declined from around 27% to about 16% of system demand in the last four years.

As both BESS and solar PV installed capacity continue to grow in California, it is important to remember two things in particular: which power system challenges are being addressed by batteries, and what batteries cannot really help with. Whether it is theoretically possible to have all renewable plus BESS systems in CAISO and what kind of overbuild – and economic implications for project developers and end consumers – will be associated with it remains to be seen

By Joshua T. Bledsoe, JP Brisson, Nikki Buffa, Michael Dreibelbis, Jennifer Roy, Nolan Fargo, and Samantha Yeager

On June 9, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed a proposed rule that, if approved, would grant Texas primary enforcement authority, or primacy, for permitting Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This significant regulatory change could expedite permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the state.

Four states — Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming — have received Class VI primacy to date. Most recently, EPA proposed granting Arizona primacy for all well classes, with a final rule anticipated after the public comment period ends on July 3, 2025.

Proposed Rule: Class VI Primacy for Texas

The SDWA covers six classes of injection wells, each designed for specific purposes: Class I for deep waste disposal; Class II for oil and gas production fluids (commonly known as Enhanced Oil Recovery or EOR); Class III for mineral extraction; Class IV for hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup; Class V for non-hazardous fluid disposal; and Class VI for carbon dioxide storage. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality already has primacy over Class I, III, IV, and V wells. The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) — the state agency with jurisdiction over the oil, gas, and pipeline industry — has Class II primacy.

If the proposed rule is approved, the TRC would be the state agency charged with permitting Class VI carbon storage injection wells under the SDWA. Texas’s petition for Class VI primacy follows an April 29, 2025, memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the TRC and EPA, which outlines the state’s plans for administering its Class VI well programs. Following a review of the state’s program, EPA determined that Texas’s Class VI program meets all requirements for approval, ensuring consistent implementation and enforcement under the SDWA.

Texas officials expressed support for the proposed rule, touting the potential for primacy to create greater efficiency when permitting and deploying Class VI wells in the state.

EPA is inviting public comments on the proposed rule within 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register and will hold a public hearing on July 24, 2025. Interested stakeholders can take advantage of these opportunities to interact with regulators and express concerns or support for the rule.

A Broader Trend: Other States Pursuing Primacy

Earlier this year, EPA approved Class VI primacy for West Virginia. Several states — including Alaska, Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Utah — are actively pursuing Class VI primacy or revising existing Class VI programs. Additionally, as noted above, EPA’s proposed rule granting Arizona primacy is under consideration and subject to public comment until July 3, 2025.

These efforts reflect a growing recognition of the importance of state-level management in advancing CCS projects. By obtaining primacy, states can tailor regulatory frameworks to their specific needs, potentially leading to more effective and efficient project permitting, project implementation, and emissions reductions.

The project was part of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, or MachH2, a coalition involving Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The group was selected by the Biden administration in 2023 to receive up to $1 billion in federal funding to develop one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs.

Blue hydrogen is made through converting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with the CO2 captured and stored underground. The low-carbon fuel has potential uses in industries such as power, steel, and agriculture.

BP said in a statement that it remains committed to its operations in northwest Indiana but is indefinitely pausing the hydrogen effort at Whiting.

A key challenge has been the inability to identify a suitable site for carbon storage. A BP spokesperson said that storing captured CO2 is essential for developing blue hydrogen. The company has been exploring potential sites in several counties, including Benton County, where local opposition has emerged over safety concerns.

U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, D-Highland, previously said the MachH2 project could create roughly 16,000 jobs and attract up to $6 billion in private investment.

But momentum has stalled. In November, MachH2 received $22.2 million in initial federal funding to support infrastructure development and workforce training. Since then, progress has slowed, and officials in northwest Indiana say the project remains in limbo.

After taking office in January, Pres. Donald Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which included a freeze on funding for hydrogen hubs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Last month, Mrvan and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., sent a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright urging the administration to prioritize the Indiana hub.

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

China led with more than 1 million vehicles sold, a 24% increase from a year earlier, according to Rho Motion data.

Sales in Europe rose 36.2% to 330,000 units, supported by fleet incentives in Germany and demand in southern markets. In contrast, North American sales grew just 7.5% to 160,000 vehicles, as the expiry of Canadian subsidies and ongoing uncertainty over U.S. tariffs weighed on the market.

BYD’s exports to Mexico, Southeast Asia, and Uzbekistan contributed to higher sales in those regions. In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support further sales in the second half of the year.

Global automakers face a 25% import tariff in the U.S., leading some companies to withdraw their 2025 forecasts. Tesla’s Model Y, made in Berlin, is shielded from these tariffs but continues to face pressure as global production expands.

Uncertainty over U.S. emissions policy and the future of EV tax credits, which are set to begin phasing out from 2026, is also affecting demand. Sales in other parts of the world rose 38% to 150,000 vehicles.

The White House Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to USDOT on June 3 instructing the department to disregard the GAO’s opinion on the NEVI funds, according to a June 4 report from Politico.
The OMB and USDOT did not respond to separate requests from Equipment World for a copy of the memo.

In a report issued May 22, the GAO stated the USDOT’s deferral of these $5.4 billion in funds meant for building EV charging stations, issued under the Biden-era National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, violated a provision of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a federal law that regulates the president’s ability to withhold funds approved by Congress.

The White House Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to USDOT on June 3 instructing the department to disregard the GAO’s opinion on the NEVI funds, according to a June 4 report from Politico.

The OMB and USDOT did not respond to separate requests from Equipment World for a copy of the memo.

Politico quoted Mark Paoletta, OMB’s general counsel, in the memo as saying the GAO’s opinion was “wrong and legally indefensible” and that the USDOT does not need to “take any action to adjust the recording of its NEVI program obligations, nor change its practices with respect to obligating funds for any of its [Federal Highway Administration] programs in response to GAO’s incorrect opinion.”

The GAO, which serves as a bipartisan investigative arm of Congress, gave the following rationale in its May 22 report for why the funds could not legally be deferred:

“Under the ICA, a section referred to as the fourth disclaimer prohibits withholding from obligation or expenditure funds appropriated for programs where there is a mandate to spend therefor. We conclude that the NEVI Formula Program is covered by the fourth disclaimer. Therefore, DOT is not authorized to withhold these funds from expenditure and DOT must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program.”

The GAO did point out USDOT can find other ways to rescind the funds, though they must be approved by Congress. The GAO does not have the legal ability to enforce its findings, and the USDOT is not required to immediately unfreeze the NEVI funds.

Rescinding policies and programs that support EVs was an immediate goal for President Donald Trump’s administration.

Yet these price fluctuations do not necessarily represent a broader decline in the PPA space, nor a diminishment of the value of renewable power in the European energy mix.
“In Iceland, we’ve seen a large geothermal PPA, but [not] in continental Europe, where geothermal resources are not the same.
“What’s nice about PPAs is that, essentially, a PPA is a contract between two different parties,” said Brihi.
“You see that PPAs as produced are not as common and offtakers and corporates need complex PPA delivery methods.","The growing role of PPAs has been demonstrated by figures published before this year’s procurement summit. According to Pexapark, Europe announced offtake deals for 1.6GW and 1.4GW of renewable capacity in March and April, respectively, with Europe contracting more than double the renewable power capacity in March than in the previous month.

However, the price of these deals has fluctuated more dramatically. Pexapark reports that its EURO Composite, an average of the prices secured for PPAs signed in Europe, fell 1.6% between March and April this year, with significant month-on-month price declines of 6.8% in Poland, 2.6% in Belgium and 2.2% in Germany.

Yet these price fluctuations do not necessarily represent a broader decline in the PPA space, nor a diminishment of the value of renewable power in the European energy mix. Instead, they reflect what Nahel Brihi, corporate sustainability analyst at Bloomberg, told PV Tech Premium at this year’s Renewables Procurement & Revenue Summit was an increasing interest in signing PPAs for smaller capacities of renewable power, and for lower prices, with deals more tailored to the markets in which they are signed.

“I think as the sector evolves, PPAs will inevitably evolve with them, and then it becomes that challenge of how to develop [PPAs] and communicate them effectively to buyers so they can negotiate or share the risk,” explained Brihi. “PPAs will change as the macro environment changes.”

European PPA trends

When asked about this shift towards more tailored PPAs, Brihi added that he has seen more complex and nuanced deals signed, both in the global renewable sector in general, and European clean power in particular.

“We’re definitely seeing those trends in terms of co-located or hybrid PPAs – by co-located we just mean a mix of technologies – and we see this growing trend, especially in the US, which is the biggest market for green corporate PPAs in general,” he said, noting that Bloomberg tracked 740MW of off-site hybrid deals in Europe in 2024, compared to 17GW in the US.

Still, he noted that European PPAs can be “interesting”, as they seek to combine several financial and policy mechanisms to ensure producers and offtakers alike are comfortable with the terms of their agreement.

“In Europe, for example, what’s quite interesting is that, in the UK, we saw on the first PPA that was blended with a contract for difference (CfD),” Brihi said. “We are seeing more cross-border PPAs in Europe, which is a very good market for these sorts of things.”

The diversity in the types of deal being signed in Europe is reflected in the diversity of companies now involved in the European PPA space. Olivier de Nomazy, head of energy sourcing and market intelligence at French data centre operator DATA4, told PV Tech Premium at this year’s Renewables Procurement & Revenue event that recent fluctuations in power prices had all but obligated DATA4 to involve itself in the PPA space.

“It’s fair to say that three to four years ago, we were nowhere in PPAs, we were just buying electricity from suppliers in a very traditional manner,” said de Nomazy, whose comments are available in full above.

“The volatility of prices has pushed us to reconsider our approach. Besides, we also have very big and growing demands; I think year-on-year our consumption has been growing by a 30% average between 2023 and 2024.”

However, de Nomazy also noted that PPAs, in their current form, are not a perfect means to deliver on the goals of the energy transition in a manner that reliably meets the power demands of offtakers. While speaking on another panel at the event, he pointed to Spain as an example of a country where, despite the financial security of a PPA, the threat of curtailment means that he does not consider pureplay solar offtake agreements viable.

“Spain, for example, right now is the prime example of getting close to saturation when it comes to corporate deals and renewable additions in general,” added Brihi, who pointed to the recent Iberian blackouts as an example of a region’s broader energy environment undermining some of the security that a PPA can offer. “That could prompt both sellers and buyers to maybe take a step back and diversify their portfolios.”

Stability through multi-technology PPAs and battery storage integration

A key tool for diversifying offtake portfolios, and reducing reliance on a single technology type in a single market, is to invest in multi-technology PPAs. Brihi noted that while it is challenging to forecast what hybrid PPAs will look like on a scale as broad as Europe as a whole, he said that he was “really excited” about the future of multi-technology deals in markets across the continent.

“I don’t know what it’s going to look like in Europe,” said Brihi, who noted that “we might see the first nuclear PPA in France, which would be really exciting.

“In Iceland, we’ve seen a large geothermal PPA, but [not] in continental Europe, where geothermal resources are not the same. We might see more hydro PPAs; I know, at some point, there were a few small hydro deals being signed, and that would be really interesting too.”

When asked about battery storage systems, which are often linked to renewable power sources and heralded as a way to limit the uncertainty that can arise from relying on more variable renewable power, de Nomazy was keen to stress that, in his opinion, batteries are useful up to a certain point.

“We see batteries as a very good solution to deliver peak production, and work on demand management sorts of things to support the grid,” de Nomazy said, whose comments are available in full above. “At the level of price that we have in Spain, for example, we cannot consider the batteries are a good way to transform the solar curve into the baseload curve, which is the ideal product that we would like to buy.”

Unsurprisingly, predictability remains the priority for offtakers, with many interested in matching power procurement to baseload, and securing this electricity consistently, rather than investing in a particular technology type. Magdalena Hilgner, head of energy department at Polish telecoms company PLAY, told PV Tech Premium as much during last year’s Large Scale Solar Central Eastern Europe event, and this sentiment was echoed by Karim Rizk, business development manager at TokWise, which provides software and AI models for the renewable energy industry.

“I think the right word would be ‘volatility’,” he said, speaking to PV Tech Premium at the Renewables Procurement & Revenue summit. He went on to suggest that investing in multi-technology PPAs is one way to tackle this volatility, but there are other steps that can be taken, including more nuanced financial mechanisms and the use of AI tools to better manage power purchasing.

“The idea is for every market player to find a way to manage that [volatility],” Rizk said. “On the PPA side, you see a lot of settlement closes now negotiated on how they’re going to handle the negative prices.”

Securing stability through market mechanisms

Brihi also spoke to this idea of using more nuanced financial tools to deliver the kind of stability that offtakers value.

“What’s nice about PPAs is that, essentially, a PPA is a contract between two different parties,” said Brihi. “Right now, what we’re seeing is that there are more elements that keep getting added in the contracting process, which can make things more difficult, but it shows that PPAs evolve.”

When asked about the deals his own company has agreed, de Nozomy pointed to a ten-year PPA signed with Edison Energia to acquire electricity generated at a 148MW project in Italy. The contracted power alone will account for one-tenth of the company’s electricity consumption in its Italian operations, and de Nozomy suggested that the flexibility of both companies involved in the PPA discussions was a key reason for the deal’s completion.

“Edison showed good flexibility, because the deal [includes] ramp-up scenarios so it accompanies our growth expanding the size of the PPA over time: starting slightly small and growing during the six or seven first years of the contract,” said de Nozomy. “They were also integrated with their supply contract in an easy manner.”

According to Rizk, the increasing appetite for PPA deals, and the increasingly close relations between independent power producers (IPPs) supplying this power and the offtakers keen to acquire power in increasingly tailored and specific manners, means that IPPs are starting to resemble energy suppliers.

“At the end of the day it’s a strategic decision for IPPs to move in that direction; it’s not just a one-off thing,” said Rizk, whose comments are available in full above.

“IPPs usually have a view of the next ten, 15 years, and we see that IPPs want to move to being energy suppliers, so that’s the motivation behind [the thinking]: ‘okay, we need to have this kind of capability, and since we have the tools that enable us, we can do that.’

“If you have that kind of capability, you will also have the opportunity to offer more complex products,” he continued, referring once again to increasing PPA complexity in Europe. “You see that PPAs as produced are not as common and offtakers and corporates need complex PPA delivery methods. If you don’t have the capability on how to manage the residual volume you have, or the shortage you have, on the short-term market, you will not be able to offer such products.”

“We need to have a very tailored, very accurate view on every single detail of those PPAs,” agreed de Nozomy, who went on to describe the increasingly close relations between IPPs and offtakers as an “interesting” space, that suggests the future of the European PPA space could be one of close personal relationships and more compelx financial mechanisms.

“Seeing the supplier getting into those PPAs is interesting because, as a supplier, they do monitor our consumption on a daily manner so they can anticipate and understand our needs almost as good as we do,” de Nozomy said. “That’s why working with those guys is quite useful.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54550204917_75708b5443_k.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:18.321171

There are some specific factors that made the PJM capacity increase so much higher than would normally be expected.
In 2022 a host of new gas-fired power plants were proposed, 3.5GW in total.
It could opt for the German solution and say 10GW of new gas-fired plant will be hydrogen fuelled at some time in the future.","One interesting story this week. The thermal power arm of India's Adani Group, Adani Power, has set up a Middle Eastern arm in Abu Dhabi. Given the number of renewable schemes in the Gulf, it might have been expected the renewables arm Adani Green Energy would have moved in. But the renewables market is highly competitive in the Gulf. The thermal market is not.

While there are plenty of bidders for renewable schemes, there are not for the new baseload gas-fired capacity, which is clearly needed in the region. It is unclear what Adani Power Middle East will be up to but there is certainly a need for new blood in that market.

In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland PJM region covering 13 US states and the District of Columbia, the development of new gas-fired plant has stalled after a fruitful decade in the 2010s.

The fact that prices in the latest capacity market auction jumped 800% from US$28.92/MW-day to US$269.92/MW-day for the 2025/26 delivery period should certainly send a development signal. But thus far just Calpine has come out and said it will look to develop new gas-fired generation, although it states clarity is needed on state-level air emission regulations.

In the meantime existing generators will make hay while the sun shines. Four term loan B refinancings have been put to bed since the auction, and stock prices are up for existing generators. LS Power has pooled all its gas-fired assets across PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO into one 11GW unit Lightning Power and quickly raised a competitive debt financing.

The cost of the latest auction is US$14.7bn, up from US$2.2bn in the 2024/25 delivery period. Oops.

There are some specific factors that made the PJM capacity increase so much higher than would normally be expected. New Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules in late 2019 impacted the way the PJM auction process was conducted and since then there have been plenty of new changes. The latest auction was the first in two years, a catch-up auction. Another auction is planned in December and then the normal auction schedule should return.

But a further specific factor is extreme weather events. But is this really a PJM specific event? Winter Storm Elliott in late 2022 saw 23% of the PJM generation capacity out of action so FERC called for better risk-monitoring of assets winning capacity contracts during extreme weather events.

The poor performance during the storm has been put down to the fact renewable subsidiaries in the region increased the headline generation figure, lowered capacity market prices but not capacity during cold and hot days. That said, renewable industry proponents say it was the gas-fired plants that really failed, froze up, during the storm. Maybe both are to blame.

Of course a key issue has been supply and demand – the ongoing retirement of coal-based load plant with new capacity not filling the gap due to transmission constraints and economics, that is higher construction and interest costs.

Capacity market payments are on the rise across the world. In the UK, prices have doubled. The 15-year T-4 capacity market cleared at £65/kw/year earlier this year, up from a record high of £63/kW/yr in the 2023 auction, £30.60/kW/yr the previous year and £18/kw/yr in 2020. That said, as in PJM, thus far only the existing generators have benefited. In 2022 a host of new gas-fired power plants were proposed, 3.5GW in total. But none have since been built.

The previous UK government started to raise the possibility of building new base load gas-fired plant, simply because the supply demand numbers do not add up in the next five to 10 years. Whether the new Labour Government follows this lead will be interesting. It could opt for the German solution and say 10GW of new gas-fired plant will be hydrogen fuelled at some time in the future.

Various solutions are, of course, needed. Renewable generation linked with storage is one. In PJM the new services queue is made up of 94% renewables. But in its report ""Energy Transition in PJM – Resource retirements, replacements and risks,"" PJM said given the ""operating characteristics of these resources, we need multiple megawatts of these resources to replace 1MW of thermal generation"".

In PJM 40GW of existing generation could be offline by 2030.",https://media.pfie.com/prod/images/gm_preview/e3b1e87716be-us-gas-power.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:14.680005

Arizona Senator Mark Kelly joined Governor Katie Hobbs, Arizona elected officials, and business leaders in opposing provisions in Trump and House Republicans’ budget bill that would jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum as a hub for innovation in energy, clean tech, and manufacturing industries by rolling back critical tax credits created in the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Arizona has worked to make sure we’re a great place to do business—with the help of both Democrats and Republicans over the years. Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits. We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Republicans’ plan to cut these programs will put thousands of Arizonans out of work and make energy prices go up. I’m working with Governor Hobbs and others to stop the bad Republican plan and protect Arizona’s economy,” said Sen. Kelly.

“Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. Instead, they’re actively cutting jobs. This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families. Slashing clean energy tax credit jeopardizes billions in investments by stalling our state’s economic momentum,” said Sen. Gallego.

“If clean energy tax credits are repealed, Arizona loses out on tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and families’ energy bills go up,” said Rep. Stanton. “I want the industries of the future here in Arizona, not overseas.”

“What we have seen so far from the Trump Administration and House Republicans has been chaos and now they want to further jeopardize Arizona’s economy with cuts to jobs and historic investments,” said Rep. Ansari. “This is just bad policy. I’ll continue to work with my colleagues to secure Arizona’s investments and future.”

“The Arizona Promise is built on creating opportunities for working-class Arizonans and growing our economy,” said Gov. Hobbs. “Over the last three years, Arizona’s economy has boomed, and business investment and job creation have accelerated by leveraging federal tax credits created in the IRA. Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries. The federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success, not undermining our growth.”

Arizona Investments secured in the Kelly-shaped Inflation Reduction Act that are now at risk:

These tax incentives have created historic investments in economic and workforce development around Arizona. Through growth in energy, advanced manufacturing, and other improvements in supply chains and innovation, these federal investments are growing and maintaining Arizona’s energy and tech economy. The Arizona Commerce Authority, which leads economic development efforts, has found repealing the tax incentives for energy infrastructure and manufacturing could jeopardize:

$58 billion in potential, existing, and announced private-sector investment in Arizona and 69,000 potential new jobs created.

134 project leads attracted to communities statewide.

The Clean Energy Buyers Association has also projected an 11.4% increase in annual electricity bills per household by 2029 if the Republican-led bill is enacted.

See what other Arizona leaders are saying:

“Arizona’s competitive edge in advanced manufacturing is no accident—it’s the result of smart policy, strategic investment, and strong partnerships,” said Danny Seiden, President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. “Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state. Preserving them is critical to sustaining Arizona’s manufacturing momentum and keeping us at the forefront of next-generation industries.”

“We are investing billions of dollars in Queen Creek and look forward to creating high quality jobs in Arizona, as we bring our advanced manufacturing expertise and experience to the United States. We hope Congress will endorse the current tax credit that will help secure a strategic U.S. supply chain and to manufacture leading-edge batteries in Arizona,” said Richard Ra, President of LG Energy Solution Arizona.

“Continuation of 45X and other clean energy policies give businesses like Lucid certainty to deepen our investments in U.S. production and the communities where we operate. These pro-manufacturing, pro-clean energy, pro-worker policies support our commitment to Arizona and the U.S. as we create good-paying jobs, expand American high-tech manufacturing, develop domestic supply chains, and export more automobiles to foreign markets,” said Jessica Nigro, VP of External Affairs of Lucid Motors.

“With our highly skilled workforce, reliable energy, and attractive business environment, Arizona has been a big winner for advanced manufacturing projects receiving investments under the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “Phasing out or eliminating these financial programs could seriously jeopardize projects in our pipeline as well as those that have already selected Arizona.”

“Arizona leads the nation in building a clean energy economy that attracts investments, creates jobs, lowers costs, improves air quality, and saves water. A repeal of these tax credits will hurt Arizona workers, communities, and businesses,” said Maren Mahoney, Director of the Arizona Governor’s Office of Resiliency. “Without these federal investments in clean energy technology, Arizona families stand to lose out on good-paying jobs in manufacturing and construction, and risk even higher energy bills.”",https://www.kelly.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_Logo_Social.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:21.545686

Tri Pointe Homes now includes its “LivingSmart” package in every house it sells in the region. Standard items range from dual-zone HVAC and formaldehyde-free insulation to WaterSense faucets and pre-wired electric-vehicle chargers.

“You’re gonna save about 30% on your heating and cooling bills,” said James Flanagan, vice president of community experience at Tri Pointe Homes.

Mary Blevins and her husband, Ron Colello, moved latt year into a LivingSmart home in Pittsboro.

“I would say we saved anywhere from $75 to $90 a month,” Blevins said. “We’ve had gas bills as low as $15 in the summer.”

Their favorite upgrade is a tankless natural-gas water heater.

“You don’t run out of water,” Blevins said. “You can do the clothes, the dishwasher, the showers, all at the same time. It’s extremely efficient.”

Residential buildings account for about 20% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Flanagan said cutting that footprint is good for business, too. Energy-saving perks have helped push Tri Pointe’s Triangle sales up 20% in the past year.

Even older houses can benefit from small changes. Raising the thermostat two degrees when residents are away can trim about 6% from a cooling bill. Replacing incandescent bulbs with LEDs can cut lighting energy by roughly 75%.

SMR Exploration: Talen and Amazon will evaluate development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and nuclear plant uprates in Pennsylvania.

Statewide Economic Boost: $20B Amazon investment expected to create 1,250 jobs and accelerate energy infrastructure modernization.

Amazon has expanded its nuclear energy partnership with Talen Energy, securing 1,920 megawatts of carbon-free power to support its growing AI and cloud infrastructure needs. The electricity will be sourced from Talen’s Susquehanna nuclear plant and delivered under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) through 2042, with potential for extension.

Talen President and CEO Mac McFarland called the agreement a “long-term, steady source of revenue,” adding, “We remain a first mover in this space and intend to continue to execute on our data center strategy. Talen is well-positioned to support Amazon’s energy needs as it invests further in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

The deal also sets the stage for future innovation, as Amazon and Talen will explore the deployment of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and capacity expansion at Susquehanna. These initiatives aim to inject new clean energy into the PJM grid, reinforcing Pennsylvania’s energy independence.

Amazon’s $20 billion investment in the state—the largest private sector commitment in its history—will create 1,250 high-skilled jobs. “Amazon is proud to help Pennsylvania advance AI innovation through investments in the Commonwealth’s economic and energy future,” said Kevin Miller, AWS VP of Global Data Centers.

The current co-located power arrangement will shift to a “front-of-the-meter” setup after a transmission reconfiguration in Spring 2026. From then, Susquehanna’s nuclear output will feed directly into the PJM grid, with PPL Electric Utilities managing transmission.

“Connecting large load customers like data centers to our transmission system helps lower the transmission component of energy bills for all customers,” said Christine Martin, president of PPL Electric Utilities.

Policymakers welcomed the deal as a catalyst for energy and economic growth:

“This partnership… will power the largest economic development project in Commonwealth history,” said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “We stand ready to work with Talen Energy and its partners to review permits for this project as efficiently as possible.”

“Our communities will benefit not only from economic development but from the Susquehanna plant’s role as a major employer,” said U.S. Representative Dan Meuser (R-PA).

“Our members, friends, and families all benefit from the jobs and community growth this investment… will bring,” noted IBEW Local 1600.

EPA Sets Record Blending Mandate for Biomass Based Diesel

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed record blending mandates for biomass based diesel in the Renewable Fuels Standard.

The agency raised the levels 67% from 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and upped volumes to 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

The levels for 2026 exceeded the industry’s recommendation of 5.25 billion gallons, according to Kurt Kovarik, Vice President, Federal Affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America:

“EPA’s math would indicate that the volume requirement for biomass -based diesel for 2026 is going to be about 5.6 billion gallons, which by any measure, if they’re close or in the ballpark, This is a significant step change from the 3.35 billion gallons that was mandated for biomass -based diesel for 2025, which is exactly what we asked for.”

Biofuels and Feed Stock Imports Discounted

To level the playing field, EPA is also discounting the value of the RIN credit by half for foreign biofuels imports or the use of foreign feed stocks.

“So, only 50% credit for a fuel that’s produced abroad and imported or a fuel that’s produced domestically from a foreign feed stock. And in this case, foreign is any country other than the United States. So even feed stocks from Canada and Mexico,” he explains.

EPA Decision Signals Growth

Both of these actions will send a huge message of growth to farmers and the industry, which is already producing biomass based diesel near these levels.

“This is a real recognition of the investments that have made in in feed stock development the investments made by soybean farmers the enormous expansion of capacity in renewable diesel and biodiesel production,” he adds.

Small Refinery Exemptions Could be Reallocated

While EPA did not deal with the backlog of 169 Small Refinery Exemptions in this proposal, the agency has signaled reallocation, a precedent set under the first Trump administration.

“So by estimating or committing to estimate those gallons and reallocate them. It means that biofuels producers will be held harmless the small refiners will get the Relief that they seek but those that those gallons or those that mandate won’t simply evaporate,” he says.

Meanwhile, the mandate for conventional corn-based ethanol will remain at 15 billion gallons for both years, which is in line with what the industry recommended.

This proposal now goes through a comment period but EPA has indicated they expect to have it finalized by November 1 at the latest.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/39da5a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fc1%2Fc8dd9b4d4fb598c3fd4786c0314f%2Fd4ae82ef07c942b8b45950e673683dd8%2Fposter.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 22:02:54.503086

The administration has proposed cutting funding for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s sprawling in-house research arm, by 5%, or $90 million, to $1.7 billion.
Even at current funding levels, those agencies have been beset by resignations and internal turmoil.
It also sustained current funding for NIFA’s $445 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), USDA’s prime source of competitive grants to academic researchers.
Such a step would likely block or at least complicate the administration’s plans for science spending and spare researchers a devastating blow—at least for now.","The Republican-controlled Congress this week offered the first signs that it will resist at least some of President Donald Trump’s proposals to slash federal spending on science. A key committee in the House of Representatives rejected the administration’s plan to make deep cuts to research programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the leader of the Senate’s appropriations panel called plans for a 40% cut to the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) $47 billion budget “disturbing.” Members of another Senate committee also signaled bipartisan opposition to cuts at the U.S. Forest Service.

The clearest sign of unease with Trump’s plans came on 11 June, as the full House Committee on Appropriations met to begin finalizing its version of a bill that sets USDA’s spending for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins on 1 October. The administration has proposed cutting funding for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s sprawling in-house research arm, by 5%, or $90 million, to $1.7 billion. And it wants to cut the budget of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), a major source of funding for research done at universities, by 38%, or $642 million, to about $1 billion.

Even at current funding levels, those agencies have been beset by resignations and internal turmoil. At NIFA, for example, grant programs have not accepted new proposals since 23 January because all of the agency’s solicitations are “under review.” NIFA staffers were also recently told that a new USDA “efficiency team,” set up by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially run by Elon Musk, will review all future recommended grants. DOGE “is now embedded in the system,” said one NIFA staffer.

Against that backdrop, the House panel opted to ignore the administration’s proposed cuts, instead keeping funding for both programs roughly flat: about $1.8 billion for ARS and $1.7 billion for NIFA. It also sustained current funding for NIFA’s $445 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), USDA’s prime source of competitive grants to academic researchers. The administration had proposed cutting AFRI by 9%, or $40 million.

In a report accompanying the bill, the committee also “rejects proposed research program terminations.” The language appears to refer to a proposal to shut down or relocate several major ARS research programs: the country’s soybean gene bank, which maintains a collection of thousands of varieties at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC); a citrus collection in Riverside, California; and a research station in Delaware dedicated to finding natural predators of invasive agricultural pests.

A USDA spokesperson defended the proposed cuts in an email, saying they target “research sites across the Nation that have exceeded their ideal lifespan.” But that claim is “just not true,” says crop scientist Adam Davis of UIUC. The ARS facilities at UIUC recently underwent renovation and had “received a facility condition rating of 96 out of 100” in a recent evaluation, he said.

Davis suspects the facilities were targeted because of partisan politics. “One is in Delaware, one is in Illinois, and one is in California,” he notes. Those are the respective home states of former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, and former Vice President Kamala Harris—all Democrats.

The Republican-dominated House panel’s rejection of the USDA cuts came as a pleasant surprise to Julie McClure, vice president at the Torrey Advisory Group, a lobbying firm that represents the American Society of Agronomy and several farm organizations. She credits the bipartisan support that agricultural research has long enjoyed in Congress. “Part of that is because a lot of land-grant universities, where this research is done, are in Republican districts and states.”

In the Senate, key Republicans pushed back on White House plans for a much bigger cut, in NIH funding, at a 10 June hearing of the appropriations subcommittee that sets the agency’s budget. Senator Susan Collins (R–ME), who chairs the full appropriations committee, called the proposed $18 billion cut “so disturbing” and said “it would undo years of congressional investment in NIH and it would delay or stop effective treatments and cures.” Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R–WV), head of the subcommittee, noted that “supporting biomedical research is a priority for me. … [I]t is important that America remains the leader in biomedical innovation and research.”

At an 11 June hearing held by a different Senate spending panel, lawmakers expressed bipartisan concerns about a White House request to cut the Forest Service’s budget by 65%, or $4 billion, to $2.1 billion, and eliminate the agency’s $300 million research program. Senator Jeff Merkley (D–OR) was particularly critical. “Instead of slashing these programs,” he said, “we should be investing in good science.”

Congress is still in the early stages of crafting the 2026 budget, and it’s not clear whether lawmakers will ultimately agree to ignore or soften some requested cuts. There are also increasing signs that Congress and the White House will be unable to agree on final 2026 spending numbers by 30 September, when the current fiscal year ends. In that event, lawmakers would likely pass a continuing resolution that freezes spending at current levels, possibly for up to a full year. Such a step would likely block or at least complicate the administration’s plans for science spending and spare researchers a devastating blow—at least for now.

Science advocates note even that outcome would not undo the damage they say the Trump administration has already done to many science agencies by terminating or delaying grants and contracts and firing or pushing out staff. At NIFA, about one-quarter of the program’s staff have taken the administration’s “deferred resignation” offer and left their jobs, according to former NIFA Director Sonny Ramaswamy. And according to a May report in Politico, more than 15% of ARS staff has resigned. “Lots of people are looking to leave, just to get out of the system and all of the drama,” says Charles Rice, a soil scientist at Kansas State University.

Meanwhile, Rice has been wondering whether his graduate students, many of them from other countries, should travel to Canada in July for a major soil science meeting. “We’ve been cautioned not to go, because they might not get back into the country,” he says. “That’s really frustrating for me. Not to be able to show your work, make connections for jobs. So I’m trying to decide, do we risk it?”",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zpomeg8/abs/_20250612_on_reverseusdacuts.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 23:03:16.783164

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.): “We are making great progress on our Republican reconciliation bill that will lead to a stronger and safer America. And those two are intertwined, because you can’t have a strong and safe America – you can’t have a prosperous America unless you have a safe America.And so prosperity and security, safety are all issues that are intertwined, and our budget reconciliation bill addresses all of the above.” (Senate Majority Leader: Thune: Senate Republicans’ Bill to Create a Strong, Prosperous America – 6/10/25)

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.): “Americans want safety. They want security. American families deserve safe communities. For too many, like those in Los Angeles, that safety feels out of reach. Republicans have a bold solution to change that. It starts with securing our borders and deporting illegal immigrant criminals. We have to pass it as quickly as possible. The American people are demanding it.” (Sen. Barrasso: Barrasso on LA Riots: Democrats Side with Illegal Immigrants and Rioters, Not Law-Abiding Americans – 6/11/25)

Senate Republican Conference Chairman Tom Cotton (R-Ark.): “The threat from the radical left is clear: Don’t enforce immigration laws. If you do, left-wing street militias will burn down cities, and Democratic politicians will back the rioters. The president is absolutely right to reject this threat, enforce immigration laws, and restore civil order… Further, the Republican budget bill provides a huge funding boost to immigration authorities so they can secure our border and deport criminal illegal aliens out of our country.” (The Wall Street Journal: Opinion: Tom Cotton: Send In the Troops, for Real – 6/10/25)

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.): “Donald Trump won a decisive mandate last November on an America First message of securing America’s borders against Joe Biden’s unlawful invasion. Now more than ever, we need to pass President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill so that ICE has the resources it needs to continue deporting illegal aliens. We either have a country and respect for the rule of law or we do not. What’s happening in Los Angeles is nothing but an anti-democratic riot, which Democrats are only encouraging. Shameful.” (Sen. Banks: post on X – 6/8/25)

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): “The Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the largest tax cut in history, and it even includes what I’ve been working on for years: No Tax on Social Security for seniors. We’re going to get this across the finish line.” (Sen. Blackburn: post on X – 6/11/25)

Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.): “This bill takes a commonsense approach to reforming SNAP—cutting waste, increasing state accountability, and helping recipients transition to self-sufficiency through work and training. It’s about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars while giving folks the tools to succeed. At the same time, our farmers and ranchers are facing real challenges, which have been unaddressed for too long. This legislation delivers the risk management tools and updated farm bill safety net they need to keep producing the safest, most abundant and affordable food, fuel, and fiber in the world.

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.): “So, I think that my colleagues need to certainly take into account the fact that this is a pro-growth bill.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.): “Border Security is National Security. Border Security is Economic Security. The riots in LA have made this clear. OBBB will give Border Patrol what they need to continue to keep our country secure. It provides funding to:

Finish President Trump’s border wall

Hire 10,000 new ICE personnel

Hire 5,000 new customs officers

Vermont is one of 17 states plus the District of Columbia that have adopted California’s rules.
They allege the Trump administration is violating states’ rights and subverting the separation of powers, among other complaints.
Mihaly said it's critical that even small states like Vermont take a stand against efforts to roll back environmental protections at the federal level.
This is the third environmental lawsuit Vermont has brought against the Trump administration since President Trump took office in January.","Vermont is joining 11 other states in suing the Trump administration for revoking California’s long-standing ability to regulate air pollution from cars and trucks more stringently than the federal government, and to require the sale of more electric vehicles within its borders.

At stake is Vermont and other states’ ability to phase out the sale of new gasoline and diesel powered cars, in favor of electric alternatives.

The lawsuit alleges that Congress — and the president in signing resolutions earlier this week — acted illegally to revoke waivers that allow California to set these stricter standards, and other states to follow their lead.

Vermont is one of 17 states plus the District of Columbia that have adopted California’s rules.

In a statement issued Thursday, President Donald Trump was critical of California’s policy:

“It is the Federal Government, not states, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality,” he said. “A patchwork of state vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable.”

In a statement, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark called the move an “inappropriate overreach” by Congress and the administration.

“Vermonters believe in protecting our environment and we understand the importance of transitioning to cleaner cars and trucks,” Clark said. “And critically, Congress cannot circumvent the processes enshrined in the Clean Air Act.”

Vermont is one of several states that has adopted California’s standards for cars and trucks, which would phase out the sale of new diesel and gasoline powered vehicles by 2035.

To date, it’s the biggest step outlined in Vermont’s Climate Action Plan that the state has taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.

Reducing climate-warming pollution from cars and trucks will be crucial for Vermont to meet its statutory commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Global Warming Solutions Act, as transit is the state’s biggest source of emissions.

Gov. Phil Scott issued an executive order this spring pausing Vermont’s implementation of the latest phase of California’s EV rule, which was set to require car manufacturers to send more electric vehicles to Vermont car dealerships starting in January 2026.

More from Vermont Edition: Why did Gov. Scott pause the electric vehicle mandate?

Vermont first signed on to follow California’s lead in regulating car emissions decades ago. Clark said it reflects the state's longstanding commitment to protecting the environment — and a system that has been in place and worked well for a long time.

“Twenty-five years ago we jumped on board, and we've been able to live in our values for this whole time,” Clark said. “Now we're in a situation where it's really disappointing that we have a president who doesn't want to follow the rules, and we're having to waste time in court fighting for what we should be able to have just by virtue of the law.”

The lawsuit filed Thursday argues that Congress and the federal government are circumventing the established process to roll back the waivers. The states say this flies in the face of long-standing legal precedent under the Clean Air Act and other laws, and is unconstitutional.

They allege the Trump administration is violating states’ rights and subverting the separation of powers, among other complaints.

Elena Mihaly is a lawyer with the environmental nonprofit Conservation Law Foundation. She applauded Vermont's lawsuit, and said these rules are critical for New England states in particular.

""Transportation is one of, if not the largest, source of carbon pollution in New England,"" Mihaly said. ""It's really important that we retain having a way to tackle that pollution issue.""

California, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington are among the other states filing suit.

Rystad Energy estimates that this growth will continue, predicting an increased installation rate of approximately 16 GW per year by early 2026.

As energy demand rises in the US due to increased electrification, grid resilience will continue to be critical, with batteries playing a key role in meeting this need, along with both traditional and renewable energy sources. The US grid-scale BESS market delivered a very healthy growth of around 60% in 2024, rising from six gigawatts (GW) of capacity added in 2023 to 10 GW of installations. Planned inventory is a very strong leading indicator of actual capacity additions and we believe this rate of growth will create increased annual battery demand for grid-scale BESS

States that are witnessing the highest levels of BESS market growth are Texas and Arizona, with the California market stabilizing last year. Texas became the largest US BESS market in 2024 and currently exhibits an installation rate of around four GW per annum – similar to California. Contrary to California, the BESS inventory in Texas has increased from five GW to more than seven GW in the last 12 months, pointing to a likely further increase in installations this year.

Notwithstanding the growth in Texas, it is the rest of the country that is currently experiencing a BESS boom. Led by Arizona, the BESS inventory across all emerging US markets grew from three GW in the second quarter of last year to seven GW currently. The actual installation rate currently stands at around three GW – perfectly in line with the inventory level 12 months ago. While some construction delays are expected, there is no doubt that these emerging markets will drive most of the growth in the second half of this year and first half of next year, and even beyond.

In the most mature markets, batteries play an increasingly important role during peak power demand periods as they ‘extend’ solar generation curves into evening hours. In the last 90 days, batteries have satisfied 13% of the power demand of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) during battery discharge hours. Although the trend is new, the days of batteries delivering more than 16% of electricity during discharge hours are becoming increasingly common. While the average contribution during all discharge hours stands at around 13%, the typical peak contribution during discharge hours is already close to 30%. The 90-day average peak hour contribution currently stands at 26%, adding 10 percentage points over the last 12 months.

Looking at the share of CAISO power demand satisfied by renewables – mainly solar, wind and hydro – we observed that the annual average increased from less than 30% in 2021 to more than 40% in the last 12 months. While the peak of renewable contribution in springtime is growing each year – renewables met more than 65% of daily demand on some days this year, for instance – winter dips remain similar, with renewables delivering only 20% to 25% of demand. As a result, renewables integration has to date only been able to reduce CAISO’s dependency on energy imports, which have declined from around 27% to about 16% of system demand in the last four years.

As both BESS and solar PV installed capacity continue to grow in California, it is important to remember two things in particular: which power system challenges are being addressed by batteries, and what batteries cannot really help with. Whether it is theoretically possible to have all renewable plus BESS systems in CAISO and what kind of overbuild – and economic implications for project developers and end consumers – will be associated with it remains to be seen

As the global mobility industry accelerates toward an electric and autonomous future, Michigan continues to lead the charge. Long recognized as the birthplace of the automotive industry, the state is redefining what it means to be a mobility powerhouse by fueling innovation, advancing electrification, and investing in the skilled workforce needed to power the next generation of transportation.

Michigan’s leadership in the electric vehicle (EV) and automotive sectors is anchored by bold investments in education, workforce development, and industry collaboration. From new training programs to strategic statewide initiatives, the state is laying the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term industry success. By strengthening the link between education and industry, the state is accelerating the development of a highly skilled workforce ready to meet the demands of electrification and advanced mobility.

At the forefront of this momentum is the Michigan EV Jobs Academy, a statewide collaboration that brings together employers, educators, and training providers to ensure Michigan’s talent pipeline aligns with real-time industry needs. More than 400 courses across the state’s community colleges have been reviewed by the academy and refined to prepare Michiganders for high-demand careers in EV manufacturing, battery technology, and semiconductor production.

Strategic partnerships with institutions like Western Michigan University and Kellogg Community College are expanding hands-on training in EV systems and semiconductor technology. Designed with direct input from industry collaborators, these programs are tailored to support Michigan’s growing mobility ecosystem, creating a talent pipeline that’s both deep and diverse.

In 2024, Michigan strengthened its commitment to talent development with a $10 million investment in the Michigan Semiconductor Talent and Technology for Automotive Research (MSTAR) initiative. This public-private partnership advances Michigan’s competitive edge in semiconductor research and training, essential to the future of EV production and innovation.

These efforts have not gone unnoticed. In April 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced Michigan would welcome the nation’s first-ever statewide EV Workforce Hub—a distinction that recognized Michigan’s leadership in cultivating a domestic, diversified EV supply chain and retaining high-quality, good-paying jobs.

Coordinating these initiatives is the Talent Action Team, a strategic effort led by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) that works directly with industry leaders like Ford, GM, Mobis, Toyota, and KLA to ensure that talent development keeps pace with the rapid evolution of the mobility and semiconductor industries. The team serves as a critical connector, bringing together employers, regional workforce boards, training providers, and higher education institutions to build a more responsive and resilient talent pipeline.

The Talent Action Team plays a vital role in translating Michigan’s commitment to innovation into real, measurable outcomes, ensuring that its workforce is prepared for today’s opportunities and ready to drive the EV and automotive industries forward.

With its rich manufacturing legacy, forward-thinking policies, and unmatched commitment to workforce innovation, Michigan stands at the forefront of the mobility revolution.

The credit for loans involved with Project Hestia is a less lucrative subsidy.
After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova faced congressional scrutiny for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients.
The largest funding was allocated to Sunnova, which aimed to provide residential solar energy to low-income households in the United States and Puerto Rico.
The accusations have brought to mind a solar company called Solyndra that failed during the Obama administration, costing American taxpayers $535 million.","The Trump administration has canceled a partial loan guarantee of $2.92 billion that had been awarded to troubled residential solar panel installer Sunnova Energy, as part of its review of government financing for alternative energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) had ‘de-obligated’ the loan guarantee, which means that the federal government is not responsible for the financing. Sunnova is restructuring its debt and has warned that it may not be able to continue to stay in business. In a regulatory filing in March, it indicated that it did not intend to use the DOE facility, Project Hestia, for the foreseeable future. Sunnova sold $371 million in bonds that are backed by the Project Hestia loan guarantee, but those notes were not included in the debt that the company is seeking to restructure.

The Biden administration announced a partial loan guarantee of up to $3 billion to support financing for approximately 100,000 rooftop solar installations, primarily for low-income homeowners, in April 2023. Biden’s Energy Department declared the facility as the largest ever commitment to solar power made by the U.S. government. The loan program became less attractive to Sunnova because the company could market cheaper, leased systems to homeowners using tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The credit for loans involved with Project Hestia is a less lucrative subsidy.

Project Hestia is a 568-megawatt project comprising rooftop solar installations, residential battery systems, and intelligent software. Hestia was expected to provide loans for these technologies to homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico. After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova faced congressional scrutiny for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients. The company was accused of scamming dementia patients on their deathbeds into signing five-figure, multi-decade solar panel leases, according to interviews and state consumer complaint records obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

Since 2009, the DOE loans office has issued more than $35 billion in loans and loan guarantees, and has been repaid by some companies, including Tesla. In 2011, during the Obama administration, a $535 million federal loan to Solyndra failed, and many are worried that other solar company failures will follow.

Under the Biden administration, the DOE loan office sought to accelerate the development of the “clean” energy sector and provided loans to companies that struggled to secure private financing. Residential solar has struggled as higher interest rates have pushed up financing costs. If the House budget bill passes in its current form, the residential solar industry will continue to falter as tax credits will be going away, rather than being uncapped as in the IRA.

Sunnova Is Not the Only Loan Cancellation By DOE

The Energy Department is cancelling seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration. Besides Sunnova’s Hestia project, two other projects include a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia.

Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy, was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, and produces hydrogen fuel using renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia for fertilizers) and carbon black. In September 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was “running short on cash and facing project delays.”

New Jersey’s Clean Energy Corridor, which is run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state’s goal of introducing 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035. When Jersey Central’s owner First Energy announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey’s coast, but the projects were canceled in 2023. Another offshore wind project in New Jersey was stopped after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project’s environmental permits.

The other four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, all of which were previously canceled by their companies.

Conclusion

DOE is canceling seven “clean” energy projects for which the Biden loan office provided loan guarantees. The largest funding was allocated to Sunnova, which aimed to provide residential solar energy to low-income households in the United States and Puerto Rico. Sunnova, however, is restructuring its debt and does not plan to use Project Hestia in the foreseeable future. The company has also been accused of scamming the elderly into signing up for residential solar projects, which has led to scrutiny by Congress.

This proposal would also repeal all previously finalized greenhouse gas standards for fossil fuel power plants.
NRECA has called the rule a costly mandate with no appreciable health benefits that would force the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.
“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed to repeal power sector greenhouse gas and mercury emissions rules that NRECA says threaten grid reliability and affordability for electric cooperatives and their members.

The rules, which the Biden administration finalized in 2024, “are unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “And they will jeopardize the reliability of the electric grid for as long as they remain in effect.”

The proposed repeals “are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” Matheson said.

The Trump administration’s main proposal for the greenhouse gas rule would repeal the 2024 regulation, which required many existing coal-fired plants and new natural gas-fueled plants to either install carbon capture and storage technologies, run at lower capacity or shut down. This proposal would also repeal all previously finalized greenhouse gas standards for fossil fuel power plants.

NRECA and its members fought the 2024 regulation in court, saying the Biden-era rule exceeded the EPA’s authority and required the use of inadequately demonstrated CCS technology. Four large electric grid operators echoed NRECA’s concerns, stating in a friend-of-the-court brief that the rule will drive the early closure of crucial generation sources.

The EPA on Wednesday also proposed repealing the Biden administration’s mercury and air rule. NRECA has called the rule a costly mandate with no appreciable health benefits that would force the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.

Comments on both proposals will be due 45 days after they are published in the Federal Register.

“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said. “Both of them are textbook examples of a bad energy policy that compounds today’s reliability challenges.”

That became apparent this week after it built its 1-millionth hybrid.

The Plant Makes More Than Hybrids, But Hybrids Are A Big Portion

Toyota's factory in Indiana is in Princeton, and its millionth hybrid off the line was a 2025 Toyota Sienna in Wind Chill Pearl. That's far from the only model built there, though. The factory currently builds Grand Highlanders, Lexus TXs, combustion and hybrid Highlanders, and, of course, Siennas. Of those, the Highlander is the biggest seller, with Toyota moving more than 89,000 of them last year, and Sienna is close behind, with more than 75,000 of them finding homes.

Naturally with these other models and different ones before them, Toyota's Indiana plant has made far more than a million cars. It has, in fact, built more than 6 million vehicles since it started producing them in 1998. Still, with that in mind, it means that at least a sixth of the plant's production has been of the hybrid variety, which is quite impressive.

These investments help drivers save money by providing expanded access to lower cost and cleaner burning homegrown biofuels like E15 (Unleaded 88). The cost-share grants were awarded by the RFIP Board during its quarterly meeting on June 4.

The approved project sites are in 48 different counties and total $1.23 million in state cost-share.

A complete list of the projects, sorted by county, is available here.

“Biofuels provide value for drivers, open new markets for farmers, support rural jobs, reduce emissions, and advance the goal of greater American energy dominance,” said Secretary Naig. “Expanding access to Unleaded 88 gives drivers more ways to save at the pump, and those savings really do add up over time. In 2024, Iowa set a new record for E15 sales, and that momentum will continue as more stations upgrade or install new fuel equipment.”

The Iowa Department of Revenue announced on April 3 that Iowa E15 sales hit an all-time record in 2024, eclipsing the previous record from 2023 by 44 percent. With 256.7 million gallons of E15 sold in Iowa in 2024 at an average price discount of 15 cents per gallon compared to E10, Iowa drivers saved over $38.5 million last year by choosing E15 at the pump.

These investments are helping more Iowa fuel stations come into compliance with the E15 Access Standard. Iowa is the first state to enact an E15 Access Standard, which requires most fuel retailers to offer E15 by Jan. 1, 2026. The law was passed by the Iowa Legislature and signed by Gov. Reynolds in 2022. For those convenience stores and fuel stations that need assistance coming into compliance, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can provide cost-share funding through the RFIP. Since the cost-share grant program began in 2006, the Department has invested more than $62 million toward expanding renewable fuels infrastructure within Iowa. This has been matched with more than $270 million by Iowa convenience stores and fuel retailers.

Specifically, the EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration.
It is also rolling back the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.

Specifically, the EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration. It is also rolling back the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix.

Then the Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan. Zeldin said the rule is similarly overreaching.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” Zeldin said. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The EPA said that any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector. In light of this, EPA is proposing that the Clean Air Act requires the agency to make a finding that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution before regulating these emissions from this source category.

Further, the EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute.

Thus, the EPA is proposing to repeal the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. The agency is taking comments on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

This proposal would save the power sector about $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026, or about $1.2 billion a year.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) supports the proposals.

“Today’s announcements are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run. Both of them are textbook examples of a bad energy policy that compounds today’s reliability challenges.”

Matheson said the existing power plant rule exceeds the EPA’s authority, disregards prior Supreme Court decisions, and requires the use of inadequately demonstrated carbon capture and storage technology. Further, he said the mercury and air rule has no appreciable health benefits and will result in the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shutterstock_132921929.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:09.662956

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.”

Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks.

According to the proposal, EPA is considering “several regulatory changes” to the RFS program that would reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs which is the measuring unit for renewable fuel, for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from imported feedstocks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports imported biodiesel feedstocks, like used cooking oil, tallow and canola oil have all increased over the past several years due to the high cost of domestic feedstocks. According to the same report, in the 2023 and 2024 marketing year, the U.S. consumed nearly 30% of biofuel feedstocks exported globally.

The news to prioritize domestic feedstocks was welcomed by Iowa Soybean Association President Brent Swart, who said biomass-based diesel supports “roughly 10% of the price per bushel of soybeans.”

“Biomass-based diesel has long provided significant value to soybean farmers, helping us weather difficult economic times and supporting our state’s thriving agriculture industry,” Swart said in a statement.

The EPA program sets overall standards and specific standards for different types of biofuels. The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027.

These figures are a significant jump from 2025 targets from EPA, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.

“This is a significant step toward putting the market back on track,” Swart said. “It is also a long overdue recognition that Iowa farmers, soybean processors and the state’s biodiesel producers, can contribute even more (to) America’s energy output.”

Swart said the announcement “provides added certainty” for soybean farmers during the growing season and he thanked the Trump administration for supporting “farmers’ critical role” in U.S. energy policy.

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said USDA and EPA have “never been more aligned” on the demand for domestically grown biofuels.

“This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world,” Rollins said in a statement.

The EPA proposal additionally waives the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and reinstates the values through 2026 and 2027, due to a shortfall in the production of the fuels made from nonfood-based renewable feedstocks, like cellulose or lignin.

The draft rule also removes renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the program, which follows a move from the Trump administration to block state-specific mandates on emissions that encouraged the use of electric vehicles.

U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the move and the EPA announcement in a statement, saying it brings RFS “back on track.”

“By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America,” Ernst said.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including the proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks.

“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers – they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.”

EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8.

Shaw said IRFA plans to work with EPA through the commenting period and to secure a final rule from the agency.

“Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history,” Shaw said. “We need forward leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rollins-at-Elite-Octone-e1743702883930.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:30.344836

Meanwhile, natural gas prices are forecast to rise as strong export growth continues to outpace US production. View the full June STEO report here for detailed insights on energy prices, production, inventories, and more.

Oil spot prices

The weekly West Texas Intermediate oil spot market price trended lower from the start of the year through May, approaching lows last seen in early 2021. As of June 6, the spot price ticked up to a two-month high of $64.06 per barrel (b) (Figure 1). Recall that in February, oil prices fell below the $70-90/b range they had generally been in for the previous two years.

The June STEO forecasts oil spot prices will decline through the end of the year to $61/b and for 2026 to average $59/b (unchanged from May).

Gas spot prices

Following the multi-decade lows seen in 2024, natural gas spot prices surged last winter due to increased heating demand, touching a two-year high of $5.90/mmBtu (million metric British thermal units) in February. The market has calmed since, driven by milder weather and higher-than-normal storage injections. As of June 6, the weekly spot price has eased to a six-month low of $2.84/mmBtu.

EIA adjusted its natural gas forecast lower in June for the second month in a row, though prices are still expected to increase. Prices are forecast to average $4.00/mmBtu in 2025 (down from May’s estimate of $4.20/mmBtu), and $4.90/mmBtu in 2026.

Rig counts

US drilling activity has edged lower since early May, remaining at reduced levels for the past year. The latest drill rig count fell by four this week to 555 rigs, the lowest weekly rate recorded since November 2021 (Figure 2, left). Compared to the same week of 2024, there were 35 fewer rigs operating in the US this week.

EIA noted that US rig counts fell further than expected in May, and drilling activity is expected to soften further through 2026.

Canadian counts recently broke their seasonal decline, rising by 24 rigs this week to 138 (Figure 2, right). Canadian activity typically surges early in the year, then declines through May as thawing ground conditions limit access to drilling sites. This time last year, there were 22 more rigs in operation.

Curtis Tate spoke with former Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael, who supports preserving the tax credits.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: What’s at stake in West Virginia? What does the state stand to lose?

Carmichael: Well, I could just tell you, from West Virginia’s perspective, there are many projects that have been oriented towards these tax credits. You think of Form Energy. You think of the Fidelis project in Mason County that was set up for carbon capture and sequestration. The Nucor project, writ large, is about producing green steel, ultimately low carbon steel. The Berkshire Hathaway project. Those are just projects that I know for a fact, having worked in economic development and devoted my career to helping jobs and growth and opportunity in the Mountain State, that in this region, because I’ve worked on a lot of economic development projects in this region, not just West Virginia. There are many projects that are seeking these energy tax credits.

Tate: How does preserving the tax credits align with the president’s agenda?

Carmichael: This is really the quintessential American response to create an energy dominant economy that provides great jobs, future-oriented manufacturing, reshoring manufacturing. It’s so much different than what would traditionally be considered a grant or a handout to businesses. These are actual rewards for doing jobs, for creating the opportunities in America and keeping down the cost of energy and helping transition. It’s not about climate ideology or anything like that. It’s about transitioning to a more America-first, manufacturing-dominant economy that provides low-cost energy. So why would anyone want to take away energy tax credits? We’re already experiencing too much inflation in terms of our energy and power costs. Just look at your residential power bill.

Tate: Do the tax credits help create microgrids that can support AI and data centers?

Carmichael: I’m very familiar with the way microgrids work, because of the Jackson County Berkshire Hathaway designation as a microgrid and the creation of that titanium plant that’s going to be the world’s most advanced titanium manufacturing plant, with over 200 to 250 great jobs. So the way this works is an area will be designated as the microgrid that can then power with any number of energy sources. It can be geothermal, hydrogen, biomass. It can be traditional coal, oil, natural gas, that can all be then carbon sequestered. So that works in conjunction with manufacturing entities or data centers to have these areas that they can quickly get power at a reasonable price, and provide the jobs and new growth.

Tate: How do they help maintain a supply of critical minerals?

Carmichael: These tax credits are not just about energy, per se, they’re also about rare earth elements. So these tax credits can be utilized to create incentives for going out and mining these rare earth elements, these critical minerals that are involved and utilized in everything from medicine to fighter jets that are often imported from countries that are adversaries to America, and they can potentially weaponize those minerals against our energy dominance and our manufacturing and our economy. So we need to maintain these tax credits in order to assert American dominance in terms of our energy manufacturing base and secure our supply of natural critical minerals.

Tate: The credits are geared toward coal and power plant communities, right?

Carmichael: West Virginia is the only state in America that is completely within the Appalachian Regional Commission designation. So all 55 of our counties will qualify for these tax credits. And it’s so beneficial as an economic development to go out and tout these tax credits for businesses to locate in our state. We’ve seen the results, as I alluded to earlier.There are many, many more, but Berkshire Hathaway, one of the world’s largest entities, decided to put a solar field in Jackson County and build a new factory powered completely by solar energy. And then we have the Form Energy project in the Weirton-Follansbee area that has 750 manufacturing jobs. And for those who think, “OK, this is about the demise of the traditional fossil fuel industry.” That’s not the case at all.

Tate: Did you say the credits can support fossil fuels as well?",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Justice-Form-Energy-Announcement-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:06:43.401880

JFF and GNOF presented these outcomes at the recent 2025 Horizons Summit: “Dare to be Brave”.

The Quality Green Jobs Regional Challenge

Only six months after winning the JFF Quality Green Jobs Regional Challenge, GNOF has already made a big difference in the region.

“Drawn from a pool of over 100 applicants nationwide, GNOF’s proposal stood out for its innovative approach to creating green jobs in New Orleans—particularly in response to the growing challenge of water management,” said Sara Vander Zanden, a director at Jobs for the Future.

According to JFF, there is significant potential for green economy growth across the region. “GNOF is currently working with regional partners to map the full landscape of employment opportunities across green industries, including energy, construction, green infrastructure, water management, and waste management,” said Vander Zande. “As federal and state resilience investments are finalized, we expect to have more concrete data on specific job projections and employer engagement.”

JFF estimates that the Greater New Orleans region could see $5.3 billion in resilience investments creating more than 12,000 green jobs. According to JFF, by engaging with industry partners, GNOF builds trust which translates into real-life training. The acquired skills then translate into job opportunities in construction and green infrastructure.

“Equally important is GNOF’s commitment to breaking down systemic barriers that have excluded Black, Indigenous, justice-impacted, and rural individuals from economic opportunity,” said Vander Zanden. “The GNOF team also recognizes that these communities are living on the front lines of climate change and are most likely to experience its most severe consequences.”

Working with Local Partners

Over the past few months GNOF and JFF have worked with community-based groups like Thrive New Orleans, Groundwork New Orleans, and Louisiana Green Corps, to train local, underrepresented residents for high-quality green jobs in stormwater management.

Groundwork New Orleans

Groundwork New Orleans, one of the GNOF partners, is a productive local nonprofit engaging residents, volunteers, businesses, and local organizations in practical projects that enhance quality of life, restore environmental function, and support sustainable development. These projects transform the living environment and include stormwater management, tree planting, and solar installations.

Louisiana Green Corps

“Our partners at Louisiana Green Corps provide specialized training in green infrastructure and construction, with a particular focus on opportunity youth,” said Vander Zanden. “Their model integrates workforce training with environmental restoration and community resilience building.”

Thrive New Orleans

Thrive New Orleans is a training provider in the green construction and infrastructure workforce ecosystem, focusing on underrepresented populations including justice-impacted individuals. Their programs emphasize both durable and technical green skills development.

“With a strong track record of launching job placement initiatives and deep expertise in disaster response and philanthropic innovation, GNOF have demonstrated the capacity to execute complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives effectively. We’re fortunate to be working alongside them,” said Vander Zanden.

“Dare to Be Brave” 2025 Horizons Summit

The 2025 Horizons Summit, “Dare to Be Brave”, was held in New Orleans June 10–11 and hosted by Jobs for the Future. Since its inception in 2018, this annual gathering has grown into a major national event.

This year around 2,000 leaders in education, workforce, philanthropy, policy, and industry sectors discussed workforce and economic development opportunities, showcasing local partnerships as a model for equitable climate adaptation.

Andy Kopplin, President and CEO of GNOF, was a key panelist on the main stage event “Rebuilding for the Future: Workforce Resilience in the Gulf Coast”. Other panelists included Lauren Alexander Augustine, Executive Director, Gulf Research Project, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and Rachel Wolfe, Economics Reporter with The Wall Street Journal.

GNOF and the Gulf Research Program (GRP) have complementary approaches: GNOF focuses on community engagement and resilience-building while the GRP provides research and strategic insights to guide long-term workforce development.

Another session at the Summit covered “Building Resilient Regional Economies: Tools for Assessing Risk, Readiness, and Workforce Agility” with Sarah Bennett of Jobs for the Future, Anne McHugh of Portland General Electric, Jacob Robinson of GNOF, and Stacey Johnson of SUNY Buffalo.

The session introduced a practical framework and interactive data tool designed to help regions assess their economic risk, readiness, and capacity for workforce resilience and ability to grow jobs for infrastructure growth and energy efficiency.

“The coordination across construction, green infrastructure, energy, and coastal restoration sectors demonstrates how regions can build comprehensive green economy ecosystems, rather than isolated training programs,” said Vander Zanden. “We believe this model is especially relevant for regions facing similar challenges—high incarceration rates, increased climate risks, significant rural and BIPOC populations, and the need to transition traditional industries toward more sustainable practices.”",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/06/JFF-and-GNOF-Dare-to-be-Brave-Summit.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:59.963123

Sher was already a user of the car-sharing platform Turo, and the idea of turning a Tesla into an even bigger moneymaker was an attractive proposition.

But as years went by, Musk failed to follow through on that promise. So, in 2021, Sher assembled a small team and brought on co-founder Saimah Chaudhry to start his own company. “Hey, we’re just going to do this ourselves,” he thought at the time.

What they built was a new peer-to-peer car-sharing startup called Zevo, which is broadly similar to Turo, but focused exclusively on electric vehicles.

The Dallas-based startup has been in operation for around 10 months, and on Friday it announced it has raised $6 million in funding as it looks to expand across more major U.S. cities. Sher told TechCrunch that Zevo is already tracking over $8 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), and has a wait list of more than 3,500 customers — all with essentially no marketing to date.

On the renter side, an overwhelming portion of that interest is coming from gig workers, Sher said. Some 90% of people using Zevo to rent an EV are doing so to ferry passengers on Uber or Lyft, or make DoorDash deliveries.

Sher said he thinks Zevo has “the secret sauce on how to make car sharing very lucrative for the host and very affordable for the renter.”

So what’s the secret sauce?

“It’s gonna sound crazy, but the secret sauce is not raising hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to build something that can be a powerful marketplace,” Sher said. “We very intentionally raised private capital. We rejected VC capital for that reason. I didn’t want to be on a 12-month to 18-month runway of ‘spend, spend, spend, spend,’ which is how corporate America likes to do things in this world.”

Bootstrapping Zevo allowed Sher to gather good engineers, develop a strong go-to-market strategy, and cause “true disruption,” he said.

By keeping things focused, Sher said Zevo is able to send more money to the vehicle owners than they’d get on platforms like Turo.

Sher also talked up Zevo’s “contactless” process, which allows owners and renters to share a car without having to hand over keys or key cards.

That’s not novel — plenty of other car-sharing services have adopted a similar contactless process. But Sher argued that Zevo’s contactless nature is front-and-center because the service only uses EVs, which tend to be more technologically capable and therefore easier to integrate in a smartphone app.

This connectivity also makes it easier to integrate other important pieces of the car-sharing equation, like commercial insurance, Sher said. Removing red tape like that is what has made the platform so attractive to gig workers, he said, especially since many of them don’t have the credit scores required by larger car-sharing or rental services. Sher said one user likened Zevo to the MetroPCS of renting cars.

“There’s [usually] a lot of red tape: insurance cards, incidentals, tolls, supercharging, invoices, reimbursements. We’ve been able to really automate all of that,” he said. Add in that EVs tend to require less maintenance — which means more uptime — and it’s easy to understand why gig workers are interested.

The result of all this is that, in the early going, Zevo is seeing a median rental of around 80 days. Hosts, meanwhile, can make back between 35% and 65% of the cost of their car in just a year, according to Sher. Since 90% of the vehicles on the platform are Teslas, that has Sher feeling pretty confident that he’s been able to find a different way to deliver on Musk’s promise from 2019.

Of course, Tesla is now finally on the precipice of launching a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and potentially other U.S. cities later this year. There are many unanswered questions about how that service will operate, whether Tesla’s self-driving software will perform safely, and how easy it will be for owners to put their cars on the network. But it does seem like Tesla is closer than ever to putting Musk’s vision to the test.

That doesn’t worry Sher, though. He said Zevo is laser-focused on disrupting car-sharing, and doesn’t want to mess with the ride-hailing piece that Tesla is after. He thinks Zevo can break $100 million ARR with a staff of just 30 people and minimal future investment.

Even if Tesla were able to eat into the gig economy with a fleet of robotaxis — which remains a very big if — Sher said Musk would need to find a way to make millions more cars than it already does to meet the total demand for rides and deliveries.

“There’s enough for everybody here on the table,” he said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2709.jpeg?resize=1200,933",N,,2025-06-13 17:09:20.233758

EPA proposes repeal of Biden’s Clean Power Plan 2.0

On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the repeal of Biden’s greenhouse gas regulation of power plants (Clean Power Plan 2.0). As part of the proposed rule, the agency is arguing that “greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” If this were to be upheld in court, it would put an end to greenhouse gas regulation of power plants. In addition, the agency is focusing on the unrealistic assumptions made in the Biden rule regarding technological feasibility. There are many issues that CEI and allies will need to address in the comment period to support this critical proposal. The comment period will end 45 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.

EPA proposes the repeal of Biden amendments to mercury regulation

In addition to the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan 2.0, the EPA on Wednesday proposed the repeal of the Biden EPA’s 2024 amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants (MATS). For many years, the EPA has been pushing MATS regulation even though the agency has struggled to find any monetized benefits from reducing emissions of mercury from power plants. In the 2024 rule, the agency was unable to quantify a single dollar worth of benefits from reducing mercury emissions. According to the EPA, the 2024 rule has a net cost. The comment period for this proposed rule also ends 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

President Trump signs CRA resolutions rescinding EPA’s CA waivers

Yesterday, President Donald Trump signed into law three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval killing off the Biden EPA’s waivers given to California to transform the nation’s car and truck industry. This includes a CRA resolution rescinding the Biden EPA waiver greenlighting California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, a rule that would have banned the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. As a result of these resolutions, the EPA can’t take an action that is “substantially the same.”

Senators should stay strong and repeal the IRA subsidies

Lobbyists for the companies hoping to cash in on the many alternative energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are crying foul now that the recently-passed House budget reconciliation bill pares back several of the biggest handouts. But none of their defenses of these market-distorting giveaways hold water. Deliberations are ongoing in the Senate over its version of the bill, and Senators should at least retain – or better yet strengthen – the House limits placed on these ill-advised provisions.

United Nations report says climate change policies can exacerbate wildfires

Many forests today in the western United States are overgrown. This is one of the main reasons why wildfires have become so much more destructive recently than they have been historically. When fires have more fuel to burn through, they are more destructive. A recent report from the United Nations University, describes how climate change policies, like carbon markets and the Paris Agreement, further exacerbate this problem by planting more trees in the wrong forests.

President Trump signs four executive orders on nuclear power

President Trump recently signed four executive orders related to nuclear power. These lay the groundwork for reforming nuclear regulation and enabling nuclear power to play a role in meeting rising power demand. If successful, the Trump administration believes its efforts will increase nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts (GW) by 2050—double the target pledged by the Biden administration.

ESA reform: Congress should adopt policy that will help end sue and settle abuse

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is overdue for an update. Significant amendments haven’t been made to the law in 37 years. Fortunately, Rep. Bruce Westerman’s (R-AR) bill, the ESA Amendments Act of 2025, offers a myriad of provisions that would amend the ESA to better reflect what we know now about recovering species. If passed, one such provision would replace the one-year deadline imposed on the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to respond to petitions with the National Listing Workplan. Doing this would help ensure that outside organizations are not able to control FWS’s ESA agenda through sue and settle strategies.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Thursday reintroduced the Cost RecoveryCost recovery is the ability of businesses to recover (deduct) the costs of their investments. It plays an important role in defining a business’ tax base and can impact investment decisions. When businesses cannot fully deduct capital expenditures, they spend less on capital, which reduces worker’s productivity and wages. and Expensing Acceleration to Transform the Economy and Jumpstart Opportunities for Businesses and Startups (CREATE JOBS) Act that would substantially reform the taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. treatment of business investment. The legislation permanently enacts expensing for equipment and machinery and research and development. It introduces a neutral cost recovery system for structures (NCRS), which is economically equivalent to expensing.

Among tax legislation introduced this Congress, the CREATE JOBS Act contains the most pro-growth and fiscally responsible tax reform ideas while avoiding saddling businesses with complicated rules. By building on the most pro-growth elements of the TCJA—namely expensing of investment, and similar treatments like NCRS—this bill will make US industry more competitive and incentivize domestic investment.

What does the CREATE JOBS Act Do?

The first section of the proposal makes 100 percent bonus depreciationBonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain “short-lived” investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings in the first year. Allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. for short-lived assets, or Section 168(k), permanent. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) temporarily provided 100 percent bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and discouraging investment. , but it phased down beginning in 2023. One hundred percent bonus depreciation permits firms to immediately write off investment in assets with lives of 20 or fewer years. Currently, businesses can only immediately write off 40 percent of their investment, with the rest deducted over time, and it will phase down to 0 percent in 2027. The bill makes 100 percent bonus depreciation retroactive to the end of 2022.

The second section of the proposal would improve the cost recovery treatment of investments in structures and buildings by implementing NCRS, providing the same economic benefit as full expensingFull expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings. It alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. using a different mechanism. Under NCRS, the deductions currently taken under the 27.5- and 39-year depreciation schedules for real estate investments would be adjusted to maintain their real value over time.

NCRS would apply to new structures that businesses put in place as well as the deductions that have yet to be taken going forward for existing structures.

The third section would restore immediate deductions for research and development (R&D) costs. Because of a change made in the TCJA, R&D costs currently must be amortized over five years or 15 years, a departure from the historical norm of expensing R&D. The bill would make R&D expensing retroactive to when the policy expired in 2021.

What is the economic impact?

According to the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, the CREATE JOBS Act would grow the long-run economy by 2.9 percent, expand the capital stock by 5.3 percent, lift wages by 2.3 percent, and expand hours worked by more than 775,000 new full-time equivalent jobs. Retroactive extension of policies does not contribute to long-run growth, but it does add to the fiscal cost of the bill.

How does this bill compare to other major tax legislation?

The Tax Foundation estimates that making the entire TCJA permanent, which includes permanent extension of 100 percent bonus depreciation and full and immediate write-offs of R&D investment, would grow the economy by 1.1 percent, lift wages by 0.5 percent, and expand hours worked by 847,000 full-time equivalent jobs. It would cost $4.5 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis, $3.8 trillion on a dynamic basis.

Earlier versions of the TCJA did include expensing for structures, but lawmakers dropped the provision from the final bill due to budgetary and industry concerns.

We estimate that the House-passed version of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) would grow the long-run economy by 0.8 percent, boost wages by less than 0.05 percent, and expand hours worked by 983,000 full-time equivalent jobs. It would cost $2.6 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis, $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis.

The OBBBA temporarily extends bonus depreciation and full write-offs of R&D expenses. Further, it includes a temporary provision that provides a full and immediate write-off for structures in select industries. However, temporary policy does not contribute to long-run growth.

The CREATE JOBS Act prioritizes permanence for the most cost-effective tax reforms—expensing and NCRS—to boost growth in a relatively fiscally responsible way. To further reduce the fiscal impact, policymakers could avoid retroactive extension.

Revenue projections of the CREATE JOBS Act are forthcoming and will be added to this analysis.

State utility regulators and utilities such as American Electric Power and Southwestern Public Service Co. are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve the Southwest Power Pool’s fast-track interconnection proposal, according to filings at the agency on Thursday.

However, NextEra Energy Resources, other independent power producers, clean energy trade groups and environmental groups asked FERC to reject the proposal, which they contend would give utilities and other “load-responsible entities” the sole ability to select projects for the process without state regulatory review.

“We are concerned that [SPP’s Expedited Resource Adequacy Study] framework will undermine open access and enable preferential grid access for utility-affiliated generation, elevating the risk of uneconomic resources advancing through the queue, locking up transmission capacity, and raising costs for consumers,” the Clean Energy Buyers Association said in a filing.

Dive Insight:

Like some other grid operators, SPP is proposing to address near-term power supply needs by creating a temporary interconnection process that would run separately from its normal interconnection queue.

SPP expects available capacity to drop below its reserve margins by 2027, according to its proposal, which it filed on May 22, a week after FERC rejected a similar proposal from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Under the proposal, load-responsible entities must verify whether a project can help close their resource adequacy deficiency, according to SPP. To enter the ERAS process, projects must meet readiness standards and other requirements.

State oversight will help prevent utilities and other load-responsible entities from exercising undue preference, according to SPP. “LREs are subject to state regulation that mandates certain processes for resource selection and scrutinizes the prudence of the utility’s resource adequacy procurements, including ensuring cost-effective procurement to protect consumers,” the grid operator said in its proposal.

The ERAS proposal was unanimously supported by the SPP Regional State Committee, which represents utility regulators from 12 states.

“Based on a detailed assessment of projected demand growth, declining reserve margins, and generation interconnection uncertainties, the RSC concludes that the SPP ERAS is essential for maintaining reliability across the SPP region,” the committee said in a Tuesday filing at FERC.

In support of the ERAS proposal, a group of utilities said it also furthers the Trump administration’s national energy dominance policy priorities, which were outlined in executive orders from the president.

“ERAS … squarely addresses the executive orders issued after the declaration of the energy national emergency, answering the call for a more resilient grid that will meet the rising demand in load caused by the need for artificial intelligence dominance,” said the utilities, which include AEP, Evergy, Xcel Energy’s SWEPCO and Nebraska Public Power District.

Utilities given too much control: opponents

Independent power producers contend that ERAS would allow utilities to act as a gatekeeper to the interconnection process.

“ERAS represents an unprecedented departure from nearly thirty years of open access policy that will empower LREs to provide their own and affiliated resources with preferential access to interconnection service while erecting barriers to entry to competing suppliers,” NextEra, Geronimo Power, Pine Gate Renewables, Enel Green Power North America, EDF Renewables, EDP Renewables North America and Clearway Energy Group said in a joint filing.

SPP’s plan has the same flaw as MISO’s version of ERAS, the group’s filing says: it lacks objective criteria to make sure that resources admitted to the process are better suited to meet identified reliability needs than those excluded from the process.

The cap on how much capacity that load-responsible entities can propose for including in ERAS is based on their own resource adequacy forecasts, the companies said, noting that SPP’s proposal allows utilities and other load-responsible entities to update their peak demand values seven days after the opening of the ERAS window.

Clean energy trade groups argued the proposed process lacks adequate oversight.

“ERAS would facilitate utility self-dealing by allowing LREs to access preferential queue treatment with self-supplied generation resources, and lock up valuable transmission capacity — long before a state regulator ever sees the proposed resource, let alone conducts a review for public convenience and necessity,” Advanced Energy United, Advanced Power Alliance, the American Clean Power Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Interwest Energy Alliance and the Colorado Solar and Storage Association said in a joint filing.

SPP’s proposal is based on flawed assumptions and biased evaluations that overstate the grid operator’s estimates of its resource needs, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and Sustainable FERC Project in another joint filing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/QDiv9TYq0wUC2GsEbsq_DxtsaKs60g1BAdLJ8EuZBWo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDU0MDU2MDk1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:12.440090

The resolutions Mr. Trump signed on Thursday also revoke waivers for two other California clean-air policies.

“This is a completely improper use of the Congressional Review Act,” Mr. Bonta said in an interview.","President Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress on Thursday that block California’s effort to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles, his latest attempt to reduce the power of the nation’s most populous state.

The Republican-led Congress passed the resolutions in May to reverse the Biden administration’s approval of California’s electric vehicle efforts. When signed by the president, joint resolutions revoking federal rules carry the force of law and are not subject to judicial review.

Even so, the move drew an immediate legal challenge from California, as well as an executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom directing state officials to find another path that would move the state’s drivers toward electric vehicles and encourage companies to make them.

Mr. Trump signed the resolutions at a time when he was battling California on several fronts, most notably in a dispute over immigration enforcement, in which the president has sent National Guard and Marine troops to Southern California in an extraordinary use of military force.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump took aim at California’s longstanding authority under the federal Clean Air Act of 1970 to set pollution standards for the state that are more strict than federal limits, and at Governor Newsom’s ambition to fight climate change with an aggressive transition to electric vehicles. Repealing California’s automobile policy is central to Mr. Trump’s agenda of bolstering the production and use of fossil fuels in the United States, while eliminating policies that promote renewable energy and reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. Trump’s action reversed a Biden administration decision that allowed the state to require that electric vehicles make up a progressively larger share of new vehicles sold in California until 2035, when the state would ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars entirely.

Speaking in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump called the California plan a “disaster” and said it “would effectively abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer.”

Republican lawmakers, automobile and trucking industry leaders and oil industry executives including John B. Hess, chief executive of the Hess Corporation, were in attendance. California’s policy promoting electric vehicles would have been a major blow to the oil and gas industry.

Anticipating the president’s action, California leaders responded on Thursday with a two-part plan. Rob Bonta, the state attorney general, filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to overturn the resolutions. And Mr. Newsom directed his administration to develop new rules that encourage the use of electric vehicles and reward car manufacturers who agree to follow California’s plan to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles.

“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues, and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.

Republican lawmakers, automakers and the fossil fuel industry applauded Mr. Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these E.V. sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers. “Customers don’t want the government telling them what kind of car to buy,” he said.

For more than 50 years, the Clean Air Act has allowed California to set pollution standards that are stricter than federal rules, as long as the state obtains waivers for them from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The resolutions Mr. Trump signed on Thursday also revoke waivers for two other California clean-air policies. One blocks California from requiring that half of all new trucks sold in the state be electric by 2035. Another stops the state from putting limits on allowable emissions of nitrogen oxide from cars and trucks. Those emissions can form smog and contribute to respiratory problems like asthma.

Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, said that ending California’s electric truck policy was “common sense,” because the policy would have forced long-haul trucks and others to transition away from diesel power far faster than the existing infrastructure for electric vehicles could support.

“We looked at this as a mad dash to zero,” Mr. Spear said.

Ten other states joined California’s lawsuit challenging the legality of all three resolutions, which were the first ever passed by Congress to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers.

With nearly 40 million residents, California has enormous market power on its own, and 11 other states had intended to follow the state’s lead on electric vehicles. Together, they account for about 40 percent of the U.S. auto market. Manufacturers do not want to create two separate fleets, one for those states and one for states that go on allowing unlimited sales of gasoline-powered vehicles, so California’s policy would have had an impact nationwide.

Republicans have come to resent California’s market influence, and they have long hoped to repeal California’s ability to shape how consumer products are made and sold.

State leaders argue that the federal revocation of California’s waivers will harm public health and reduce economic benefits created by the state’s clean-car plan. Pollution from gasoline-powered cars has been linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems and cancer, Mr. Bonta said, and the plan to phase them out has spurred technological innovations that have boosted California’s economy.

“We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Mr. Newsom said.

The crux of the lawsuit is an allegation that Congress illegally used the Congressional Review Act to pass the resolutions that Mr. Trump signed. The 1996 act allows lawmakers, by a simple majority vote, to overturn rules that have been approved recently by the executive branch. Republicans asserted that the act also allowed Congress to overturn the E.P.A. waivers.

The Senate passed the resolutions over the objections of the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian and an independent watchdog, which both had ruled that lawmakers lacked the legal authority to revoke the waivers.

“This is a completely improper use of the Congressional Review Act,” Mr. Bonta said in an interview. “The Congressional Review Act applies to rules, not to waivers. It’s never been applied to any waiver, ever.”

But the act includes a provision that could stymie California’s lawsuit, because it prohibits judicial review of actions passed under the act.

The lawsuit argues that the resolutions Mr. Trump signed violate the constitutional separation of powers and encroach on states’ rights, and says that “the federal government blasted gaping holes in longstanding state regulatory programs.”

California’s ability to set tough emissions standards dates back to 1970, when heavy smog clouded the skies of Los Angeles. Since then, the state has received dozens of waivers allowing a range of policies to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Air quality has improved, but remains poor in some regions, particularly in the Central Valley. State leaders see the transition to electric cars as a tool to improve it.

California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars did not apply to used vehicles, so it would not have completely eliminated them from the roads. But voter concerns about the state’s high cost of living gave Republicans and some Democrats reason to object to California’s plan, because electric vehicles tend to cost more than comparable gasoline-powered models.

The executive order that Mr. Newsom signed Thursday directs the California Air Resources Board to come up with new ways to encourage electric vehicle use and reduce emissions, according to the governor’s office. Under it, the state would prioritize funding for E.V. rebates and will seek to develop new incentive programs. And it would steer state agencies to purchase fleet vehicles from manufacturers who agree to phase out new gasoline-powered cars.

“I’m signing an executive order to keep California on track with our world-leading transition to cleaner cars,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/12/multimedia/12nat-ca-waiver-clqv/12nat-ca-waiver-clqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:06:33.572466

With this action, President Trump is bringing back common sense, reversing the dangerous and costly energy subtraction policies pursued by the last administration.
Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense.
Thankfully, President Trump has revoked the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum.
This was exactly the right thing to do and provides a foundation for protection of the Four Lower Snake River dams.","President Donald J. Trump took bold action to revoke the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum, which would have eliminated secure and reliable energy sources.

Key administration officials, Members of Congress, and industry leaders are supporting President Trump’s action to restore common sense to the Columbia River Basin:

Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum: “This administration will not stand by while American energy is threatened. We are fiercely committed to keeping energy affordable, reliable, and made in America. Today, President Trump took decisive action revoking a Biden-era policy that jeopardized four critical hydroelectric dams powering communities along the Snake River. Now is not the time to shut down American energy. Instead, we’re keeping the lights on, costs low, and putting the American people first.”

Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright: “The Snake River Dams have been tremendous assets to the Pacific Northwest for decades, providing high-value electricity to millions of American families and businesses. With this action, President Trump is bringing back common sense, reversing the dangerous and costly energy subtraction policies pursued by the last administration. American taxpayer dollars will not be spent dismantling critical infrastructure, reducing our energy-generating capacity or on radical nonsense policies that dramatically raise prices on the American people.”

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick: “For far too long, we’ve sidelined America’s energy potential in the name of politicized programs that had nothing to do with real conservation efforts and hurt our farmers, fishers, and producers. President Trump’s actions today will give families access to reliable, affordable energy and redefine how we safeguard our environment.”

Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, D. Lee Forsgren: “Under President Trump’s leadership, the Army Corps is eager to work with our federal partners to advance American energy dominance and provide vital flood risk management, navigation, hydropower generation, water supply and recreation benefits to the Pacific Northwest and the nation.”

White House Council on Environmental Quality Chief of Staff, Katherine Scarlett: “President Trump has once again showcased his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and prioritize policies that work for everyday Americans. The Council on Environmental Quality stands ready to coordinate with agencies to save millions of dollars of federal funds that would have otherwise been wasted on misguided policies, hindering the advancement of reliable energy sources.”

U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (ID): “President Trump is demonstrating once again his commitment to listening to the will of people on the ground and the sound science that backs the current state of the dams. The Biden Administration’s controversial proposal was doomed from the start. The flawed initiative ignored congressional authority over the dams, as well as the views and feedback of regional stakeholders and constituents in Idaho. The path forward for a solution to salmon recovery must include a truly collaborative approach that involves all—including both public and private—stakeholders in the region.”

U.S. Senator Steve Daines (MT): “The Snake River Dams support agriculture production, provide a reliable energy source, and provide critical transportation. Biden’s Columbia River Memorandum was an attempt to breach the dams and appease radical environmentalist groups, with Montana communities left to pay the price. I’m grateful for President Trump’s leadership in revoking this damaging policy and for his consistent track record of supporting Montana-first priorities.”

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (WY): “For far too long, the Biden administration’s anti-American energy policies stifled American energy production and burdened western communities. I applaud President Trump’s decision to restore common-sense energy policies that will unleash our nation’s vast natural resources and create good-paying jobs while strengthening America’s energy independence and national security. The west has long been ready to lead America’s energy renaissance, and the Trump administration’s commitment to removing regulatory barriers will benefit not just our region, but all Americans who deserve affordable, reliable energy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“

U.S. Senator Jim Risch (ID): “The Biden administration’s one-sided, backroom agreement blatantly disregarded the essential role the lower Snake River dams play and the Idaho communities that rely on them. Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense. I’ve long fought the attempts by radical Democrats, unelected bureaucrats, and activist litigants to tear down our dams. Congress authorized these dams, and only Congress has the power to remove them.”

U.S. Representative Cliff Bentz (OR-02): “I have worked for more than 30 years to protect the irreplaceable Columbia River hydropower electrical system. The Biden Administration did its best to initiate the destruction of that system through improper manipulation of environmental laws and policies. This manipulation was reflected in a memorandum of understanding. Thankfully, President Trump has revoked the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum. This was exactly the right thing to do and provides a foundation for protection of the Four Lower Snake River dams. The President’s order is totally consistent with our nation’s fight to win the race for artificial intelligence, superiority, and energy dominance. The people of nation and especially the rate payers of the Northwest are incredibly grateful for this action.”

U.S. Representative Russ Fulcher (ID-01): “President Trump’s action to revoke the misguided 2023 Biden memorandum, which quietly laid the groundwork for breaching the Lower Snake River dams, puts a stop to an alarming effort to bypass Congress. I applaud this decision for standing up and responding to those of us who called on the Administration to stop this reckless attempt to tear out critical infrastructure in the West!”

U.S. Representative Dan Newhouse (WA-04): “Throughout my time in Congress, I have stood firm in my support for the Lower Snake River Dams and the critical role they play in our region’s economy. Today’s action by President Trump reverses the efforts by the Biden administration and extreme environmental activists to remove the dams, which would have threatened the reliability of our power grid, raised energy prices, and decimated our ability to export grain to foreign markets. I want to thank the President for his decisive action to protect our dams, and I look forward to continuing to work with the administration for the benefit of the Fourth District.”

Idaho Lt. Governor, Scott Bedke: “The Lower Snake River dams are essential to Idaho’s way of life. They provide irrigation, energy, and access to markets. The Biden plan threatened all of that without real input from the people who would have paid the price. President Trump is right to shut down the deal. Idaho is ready to help unleash America’s energy dominance.”

National Grain and Feed Association, Mike Seyfert, President and CEO: “We applaud the Trump administration’s leadership in rescinding the 2023 directives and recognizing the fact that these dams are critical to transporting U.S. grain and oilseeds to global markets. One barge tow moves the equivalent of 140 rail cars or 538 trucks – infrastructure that cannot be easily replaced. Breaching the dams would have caused a ripple effect throughout the U.S. agricultural value chain, and a significantly negative impact on U.S. exports and the rural economy.”

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Jim Matheson, CEO: “President Trump’s announcement smartly helps preserve affordable, reliable electricity for families and businesses across the Pacific Northwest,” Matheson said. “Hydroelectric power is the reason the lights stay on in the region. And as demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial. We appreciate the administration’s continuing commitment to smart energy policies and unleashing American energy.”

Northwest Public Power Association, Kurt Miller, Executive Director and CEO: “This withdrawal is a necessary course correction toward energy reliability, affordability, and transparency.”

Northwest RiverPartners, Clark Mather, Executive Director: “Now is the time to come together and chart a sustainable path toward effective solutions that protect salmon and maintain affordable and reliable hydropower needed by millions of people in the Pacific Northwest. This politicized agreement between the former administration and only a fraction of impacted sovereign entities, devalued hydropower, our region’s largest source of affordable, clean electricity. Northwest RiverPartners remains committed to working with all sovereign Tribes, state leaders and other stakeholders to identify science-based, durable solutions.”

Pacific Northwest Waterways Association, Neil Maunu, Executive Director: “The divisive issue of dam breaching has prevented the type of partnerships necessary to work together on productive strategies and actions to improve salmon populations for the benefit of all Pacific Northwest residents. We can have salmon and a robust economy at the same time.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 16:02:32.309663

The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act.
Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035.","President Donald Trump on yesterday signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.

The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state's zero-emission car phaseout ""has been a disaster for this country.""

Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.

Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.

""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Thursday.

Ten other states that are enforcing California's emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Newsom on Thursday also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state's commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.

Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California's emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks ""regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law."" And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.

Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.

Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..

Trump said his actions mean those rules ""are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.""

""Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation,"" he wrote. (California's mandate applies only to vehicles sold in the state; the other states agreed to enact the same rules.)",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c9fc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F84%2F41c3b08a422ca6dc035ac5b30e0a%2Fcalifornia-sues-trump-blocking-clean-air-rules-cars.JPEG,N,,2025-06-13 16:02:35.709431

On June 11, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposed rule under the Clean Air Act (CAA) titled “Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units” (the Proposed Repeal).

Under the current Obama- and Biden-era greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs) are subject to GHG emissions standards. Certain existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs must reduce their GHG emissions rates by specific amounts over a period of years leading to 2032, and in some instances, these requirements depend on their planned retirement date. (For more details, see this blog post.)

The current GHG regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but those cases have been paused, pending EPA’s reconsideration of the challenged rules. In the interim, the Trump administration issued the Proposed Repeal to revoke the Obama and Biden administrations’ GHG emission rules.

The Proposed Repeal

The Proposed Repeal outlines and seeks comment on alternative grounds for repeal. The primary approach would repeal both the Obama and Biden administrations’ GHG emissions rules for new and existing EGUs. A secondary, alternative approach would repeal the emissions guidelines for existing coal-fired power plants, the emissions standards for coal-fired power plants undertaking a large modification, and the emissions standards for new base load combustion turbines (i.e., natural gas-fired EGUs), while leaving in place certain other standards for new sources. The Proposed Repeal’s inclusion of these options will provide EPA some flexibility on how to proceed after gathering public comment.

Primary Approach

Under the primary approach, EPA would make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” In contrast to previous GHG power plant rules, EPA now interprets CAA Section 111 to require EPA to make this finding specifically for a source category before EPA can regulate GHGs for that category. EPA proposes this interpretive change, pointing to contextual arguments regarding certain provisions of the CAA and prior EPA practice. EPA also notes and seeks comment on certain potential legal considerations for its reinterpretation, including reliance interests on prior interpretations, the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, and the major questions doctrine.

After describing this statutory interpretation in the Proposed Repeal, EPA explains its proposed finding that fossil fuel-fired EGUs do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution. As an initial matter, in a nod to Loper Bright, EPA states that CAA Section 111 delegates authority and confers discretion to EPA to consider policy issues in determining the meaning of “significantly contributes,” including cost and effectiveness of emissions controls, impacts on industry, and impacts of emissions on public health and welfare.

EPA’s proposed findings include that GHGs are global pollutants and that US power plants’ emissions are low in comparison to global concentrations of GHGs. EPA proposes finding that fossil fuel-fired EGUs do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution, and therefore proposes to “repeal all [GHG] emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.”

Secondary Approach

As an alternative, the Proposed Repeal would revoke a more specific set of requirements that are based on 90% carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) as a Best System of Emission Reductions (BSER) at existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that intend to operate in the longer-term, coal-fired steam EGUs undertaking large modifications, and new base load stationary combustion turbines. EPA concludes that 90% CCS is not BSER for the relevant EGUs because “it has not been adequately demonstrated and because the costs are not reasonable.”

EPA also proposes that 40% co-firing of natural gas is not BSER for coal-fired power plants that intend to operate in the medium term. EPA determines that coal-fired power plants co-firing natural gas are an inefficient use of natural gas and constitute generation shifting, which the Supreme Court has previously found to exceed EPA’s statutory authority under CAA Section 111. Therefore, EPA is proposing to repeal the previous BSER determinations along with any emissions guideline requirements and associated presumptive performance standards. EPA would repeal existing emissions guidelines related to natural gas- and oil-fired steam EGUs as well, because they “comprise a relatively small part of the source category” such that any benefit from reductions would be offset by the cost of preparing state plans. This would eliminate or reduce most of the performance targets for the power sector.

Under either approach, EPA’s regulation of GHGs at power plants would be curtailed. The primary approach is a more absolute declaration that the requirements of CAA Section 111 have not been met and that EPA’s previous attempts to regulate GHGs in the power sector were invalid. The secondary approach does not make the same statutory declaration, but it does eliminate much of the practical impact by declaring that CCS and forcing natural gas co-firing at coal-fired plants are not BSER and may exceed EPA’s authority Section 111 as well. The secondary approach would eliminate or reduce most of the performance targets for the power sector with no clear indication from EPA that they would replace them in the near term.

Potential Impact

The Proposed Repeal follows the Trump administration’s January 20, 2025, executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” which directs all federal agencies to review and identify actions that may impose undue burdens on domestic energy production.

If enacted, the Proposed Repeal will have a significant impact on many existing and future power-generation facilities that are otherwise facing significant compliance obligations to reduce their operations, offset their emissions, and/or implement new technologies such as CCS. EPA estimates that the Proposed Repeal will create compliance cost savings of up to $19 billion. EPA’s regulatory impact analysis also includes an assessment of estimated foregone health co-benefits associated with anticipated criteria pollutant reductions related to the rules EPA proposes to revoke.

EPA’s economic and other technical considerations, along with the proposed interpretive findings, are likely to face extensive public comment and litigation challenges if they are finalized.

Next Steps

EPA will hold a public hearing 15 days after the Proposed Repeal is published in the Federal Register and will accept comments on the proposal until 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

On March 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to repeal Biden-era regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, including the updated Clean Power Plan and stricter Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).

This move aligns with President Trump’s energy agenda and is framed as part of the “Power the Great American Comeback” campaign. According to the EPA, the rollback could save the power sector $19 billion over two decades, or roughly $1.2 billion per year, starting in 2026.

Trump-Era EPA Move Targets Biden’s Climate Rules: Will the Climate Impact Be Severe?

EPA Administrator Zeldin highlighted,

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance. According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The 2024 Clean Power Plan 2.0, finalized under the Biden administration, was expected to cut 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2047. That’s equivalent to taking over 320 million gasoline-powered cars off the road for a year.

The U.S. is the world’s second-largest emitter and has the highest per-capita emissions. That puts a big responsibility on the country to lead climate action.

But hitting the 2030 climate goal won’t be easy. The Rhodium Group says emissions must fall by 7.6% every year from 2025 to 2030. And undoubtedly, that’s a steep drop.

By revoking this plan, the U.S. risks losing one of its most ambitious tools for slashing power sector emissions. The plan also targeted other air pollutants known to harm human health, including fine particulates and heavy metals like mercury and arsenic.

EPA Seeks End to CO₂ Limits for Power Plants

The EPA’s proposal includes eliminating all greenhouse gas standards under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act for both new and existing fossil fuel plants. The agency argues that CO₂ emissions from power plants do not significantly contribute to “dangerous air pollution” as defined under the Act. Therefore, they say these emissions shouldn’t be regulated in this way.

The proposal would also reverse a 2024 rule requiring carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on new natural gas and modified coal plants. Instead, the EPA is considering less strict efficiency-based rules for new gas plants.

RELATED: Is Trump’s Coal Comeback Derailing America’s Climate Commitments?

Repeal of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Amendments

Alongside the carbon rules, the EPA wants to eliminate amendments made in 2024 to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. These changes had tightened mercury and particulate matter limits for coal- and oil-fired plants. The rollback would revert the standards to their 2012 levels.

The agency estimates this repeal could save the power industry another $1.2 billion over ten years beginning in 2028. However, environmental groups argue that the 2024 MATS updates were necessary to protect communities, especially in states like West Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina, where coal power remains a key energy source.

Cites Supreme Court Ruling in Justification

The EPA is leaning on the 2022 Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the agency’s authority to reshape the U.S. energy mix under the “major questions doctrine.” Critics of the Biden administration’s rule say it tried to revive the original Clean Power Plan, which had been blocked by the courts years earlier.

It now argues that regulating power plant CO₂ emissions exceeds its authority and shifts energy decisions away from states and consumers.

Energy Security vs. Climate Commitments

The rollback is being pitched as an effort to lower energy costs, boost national security, and strengthen U.S. manufacturing. Supporters say it removes red tape for coal and gas plants that supply reliable baseload power, especially important for sectors like AI, data centers, and heavy industry.

But critics argue that the proposed changes put the U.S. at odds with its international climate commitments. The Biden administration had pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and cutting power plant emissions is a key part of that roadmap.

What’s Next for U.S. Climate Policy?

The proposed repeals are subject to public comment before being finalized. However, the EPA’s new direction signals a dramatic shift away from federal climate regulation—one that could reshape everything from clean energy incentives to carbon trading strategies.

For now, the message from the EPA is clear: the focus is shifting from emissions cuts to energy affordability and independence. But at what cost? The answer may lie in future carbon market trends, climate data, and the response from U.S. states and industries.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2187169479.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 16:02:16.475253

Company last requested a regulatory review of rates in 2022

GREENVILLE, S.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today asked South Carolina regulators to perform a public review of the company's current rates.

This is the company's first request to review rates since 2022. It comes as the company continues working to increase system diversity and reliability, enhance the customer experience and meet future energy demands.

Duke Energy Progress serves about 177,000 customers primarily in central and northeastern South Carolina.

By the numbers: The company's application in front of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) requests an overall revenue increase of $74.8 million, which represents a 12.1% increase over current revenues.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $21.66 a month – from $144.85 per month to $166.51 – effective Feb. 1, 2026. Commercial customers will see an average increase of 12.8% and industrial customers will see an average increase of around 3.6%. The amount of increase per customer class can vary based upon how much more additional revenue is needed to ensure that the class is covering the cost to serve them.

Why it matters: Duke Energy is committed to meeting customers' increasingly higher expectations around reliability, responsiveness, affordability and value.

This proposal reflects the investments we have made to strengthen the grid, improve storm readiness, maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

It also reflects how the company is doing that work: with discipline, with a focus on operational excellence, and with a thoughtful approach to how and when we seek rate adjustments.

Investments in action: The company's grid investments have positioned it well for storm response.

For example, as Hurricane Helene made its way across the Carolinas, grid improvements were already helping to combat power outages from the storm.

Smart, self-healing technology installed across the Duke Energy Progress service territory helped to automatically restore more than 10,000 customer outages and saved more than 28,000 hours of total outage time, showing the value of the self-healing programs.

Our view:

""We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers."" – Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president

Background:

Since he helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Grassley has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. Grassley also supported the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, which included requirements for cellulosic ethanol and set a mandatory RFS requiring fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022. Grassley pushed ensuing administrations to keep to this number. Last Congress, Grassley joined the No Fuel Credits for Batteries Act to nullify a proposed Biden-era E-RINS rule that props up the EV industry while devaluing incentives for ethanol and biodiesel expansion. Last year, Grassley joined a bicameral push to raise 2024-25 RVOs.

But behind their mechanical might lies a quieter, more pressing issue that impacts all of us: energy usage.

Electric motors are among the top energy utilizing components in industrial operations. As global energy demands rise, improving the efficiency of these motors is no longer a technical upgrade—it is a strategic and financial necessity.

The Scale of the Challenge

Electric motors account for nearly 45% of global electricity usage, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In energy-intensive sectors like mining, oil and gas, pulp and paper and steel production, large motors—500 horsepower (hp) or higher—often turn equipment like pumps and fans continuously, consuming vast amounts of power.

This scale of usage means that even small improvements in efficiency can lead to significant energy savings. For example, a single 94% standard efficient 600 hp motor operating 24/7 at an electricity rate of $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) can cost over $400,000 annually to run. Multiply that type of operating expense across a facility—or an entire industry—and the numbers become staggering.

Dollars & Sense: The Economic Case

When evaluating motor systems, many organizations focus on upfront acquisition costs, but the reality is that the purchase price of a motor represents just 5%-10% of its total cost of ownership. The remaining 90%-95% of the cost comes from energy consumption over the motor’s lifetime.

This is where energy efficiency becomes a powerful lever for cost reduction. A motor that is just 1%-2% more efficient can save tens of thousands of dollars per year in reduced energy costs. Over a 15- to 20-year lifespan, those savings can easily exceed the initial purchase price multiple times over.

Breaking Down Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

For a simplified example, consider a user who is comparing two motors:

Standard efficiency motor: 600 hp

(478 kilowatts [kW]), 94% efficiency, $40,000 purchase price

Super premium efficiency motor:

600 hp (478 kW), 96.5% efficiency, $55,000 purchase price

Assuming continuous operation (8,750 hours/year), an electricity rate of $0.10/kWh and that the high efficiency motor costs 15%-25% more in acquisition:

Standard motor annual energy use:

448 / 0.940 * 8,750 = 4,170,000 kWh

$417,000/year

High-efficiency motor annual energy use:

448 / 0.965 * 8,750 = 4,060,000 kWh

$406,000/year

Annual savings: $11,000

Payback period: Less than 2 years

20-year savings: Nearly $220,000

Environmental Impact: A Hidden Carbon Footprint

The environmental implications of inefficient motors are equally significant. In regions where electricity is still largely generated from hydrocarbons, every kilowatt-hour saved translates into a reduction in greenhouse gas producing emissions. On average, saving 1,000 kWh of electricity avoids the release of 500 to 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2).

For companies with sustainability targets—whether self-imposed or driven by governmental directives—motor efficiency offers a clear, measurable path to reducing Scope 2 emissions. Moreover, as carbon pricing and emissions reporting become more widespread, reducing energy use is not just good for our planet—it is good for the bottom line.

Easing the Strain on Power Infrastructure

Beyond individual facilities, improving motor efficiency has broader implications for the electrical grid. High-efficiency motors reduce peak demand, helping to stabilize the grid and reduce the risk of blackouts.

They also allow utilities to defer costly infrastructure upgrades due to population growth, such as expanding substations or upgrading transmission lines. In regions with aging power infrastructure or limited generation capacity, this can be a game changer. For utilities, it means fewer capital expenditures. For industries, it means more reliable power and fewer disruptions.

Regulatory Pressures & Compliance

Governments around the world are tightening efficiency standards for electric motors. In the U.S., the Department of Energy (DOE) mandates minimum efficiency levels for most industrial

motors up to 500 hp.

The European Union enforces similar rules under its Ecodesign Directive, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has established global efficiency classes (IE1 through IE4 and beyond).

Reliability & Performance Gains

Energy-efficient motors do not just save money; they also perform better. Because they generate less heat for the same power level, they experience less thermal stress, which translates into longer service life and fewer breakdowns. This reduces maintenance costs and improves uptime, both critical factors in industries where downtime can cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour.

Additionally, efficient motors often have better power factor and lower harmonic distortion, which improves overall system stability and reduces energy losses across the electrical network.

These performance benefits further reduce the total cost of ownership by minimizing unplanned outages, extending maintenance intervals and reducing the need for spare parts and labor.

A Competitive Advantage

In today’s market, energy efficiency is more than a cost-saving measure—it is a competitive differentiator. Companies that invest in efficient motor systems can:

Lower their production costs

Enhance their sustainability credentials

Qualify for green certifications like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 50001

Attract environmentally conscious investors and users

Looking Beyond the Motor

It is important to remember that motor efficiency does not exist in a vacuum. The motor is part of a larger system, often including drives, gearboxes, pumps, fans and control systems. Optimizing the entire system can yield even greater savings.

For example, pairing a high-efficiency motor with a variable frequency drive (VFD) can allow for precise speed control, reducing energy use in variable-load applications. Conducting a motor system audit can identify opportunities to right-size equipment, eliminate unnecessary loads and improve overall performance.

A Strategic Imperative

Energy efficiency in large motors is not a niche concern; it is a strategic imperative that touches every aspect of industrial operations. From reducing operating costs and carbon emissions to improving reliability and regulatory compliance, the benefits are clear and compelling.

As industries search for ways to maximize return on the capital expenditures (capex) investment, the electric motor emerges as a powerful ally. By prioritizing efficiency, companies can not only future-proof their operations but also contribute meaningfully to a more sustainable world.",https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/Pump_101_ABB_IMG1_980x400_0725.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:04.078618

This action issued by President Donald J. Trump, protects the power generation of four hydroelectric dams on the Snake River within the Columbia River Basin.

“This administration will not stand by while American energy is threatened. We are fiercely committed to keeping energy affordable, reliable, and made in America. Today, President Trump took decisive action revoking a Biden-era policy that jeopardized four critical hydroelectric dams powering communities along the Snake River. Now is not the time to shut down American energy. Instead, we’re keeping the lights on, costs low, and putting the American people first,” said Secretary Doug Burgum.

The Columbia River Basin is one of the largest hydropower producing regions of the country – producing nearly 44 percent of our country’s hydropower and over 29 gigawatts of generating capacity. This Biden administration policy threatened to eliminate over 3,000 megawatts of secure and reliable hydroelectric generating capacity in this area – which is enough generation to power 2.5 million American homes.

Under President Trump, Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior are advancing stable and low-cost hydropower. Hydropower is not only one of the oldest sources of energy – powering our nation for more than 100 years – but it provides reliable and affordable energy for more than 30 million American homes. Beyond powering our homes, hydropower plants can also dispatch power immediately to our nation’s energy grids, helping balance the grids and providing essential back-up power during electricity outages or disruptions.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-06-13 18:24:34+00:00,Heatmap News,The Rule That Would Make IRA Tax Credits 'Unworkable' - Heatmap News,Matthew Zeitlin,,,,,https://heatmap.news/energy/feoc-one-big-beautiful-bill,"The word of the moment in renewable energy is “unworkable.” That’s how the chief executives of two major renewables developers — John Ketchum of NextEra and Jim Murphy of Invenergy — described new requirements inserted into clean energy tax credits by congressional Republicans in recent weeks.
Starting in 2026, the bill mandates that developers seeking to claim the clean energy production or investment tax credits may not receive “material assistance” from China.
Similar strictures were also added to the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit.
You’re disqualified, all your tax credits for that small modular reactor go away,” Ketchum said.
And then there’s the deadline to even qualify for the clean energy tax credits in the first place, starting construction two months after the bill passes, according to the House language.","The word of the moment in renewable energy is “unworkable.” That’s how the chief executives of two major renewables developers — John Ketchum of NextEra and Jim Murphy of Invenergy — described new requirements inserted into clean energy tax credits by congressional Republicans in recent weeks.

“The way they’re drafted, they’re unworkable,” Ketchum said of the requirements at a Politico summit held earlier this week. He was referring specifically to a new set of provisions in the House budget reconciliation bill which say that to qualify for the credits, companies must divest their supply chains from “foreign entities of concern,” a group of countries comprising Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. But really, the rules are about China.

Around 80% of the global solar panel supply chain runs through China, according to the International Energy Agency. The batteries used in many stationary storage systems are almost entirely made in China, to name just a couple isolated examples. Starting in 2026, the bill mandates that developers seeking to claim the clean energy production or investment tax credits may not receive “material assistance” from China. That refers to any component or subcomponent (including critical minerals) that was “extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled” by a “prohibited foreign entity,” defined as a company with at least 25% Chinese ownership or 10% Chinese debt holdings, according to a memo by the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. The rules become even more strict in 2028. Similar strictures were also added to the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit.

A small modular reactor has at least 10,000 component parts, Ketchum told the Politico audience. “We come to find out that one of the screws in the bolts, used by one of the suppliers five layers down … was actually sourcing the bolt and the screw from China. Guess what happens? You’re disqualified, all your tax credits for that small modular reactor go away,” Ketchum said.

“How in the world are you going to trace five layers down to a subcontractor who’s buying a bolt and a screw?”

Murphy, the Invenergy CEO, put it more succinctly at an industry conference last week. “The supply chain can not support that, and won’t be able to support that for several years. It’s just an unworkable provision.”

While these may sound like the exaggerations of executives eager to avoid paperwork or costly new investments, analysts who have looked at the bill’s language have similarly concluded that the language is both so vague and so broad that determining whether a company has complied would be almost impossible.

Analysts at the investment bank Evercore wrote in a note to clients last week that while the new FEOC framework “ostensibly aims to keep China out of U.S. energy supply chains, it would likely bury companies and their suppliers in such onerous paperwork and diligence that the remaining tax credits are rendered largely unusable.”

Foreign entity of concern rules are not new — versions of them appear in the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act’s electric vehicle tax credits. The FEOC rules in the One Big, Beautiful Bill are far more extensive, however.

The Senate may look to loosen the rules, according to Axios, and several House Republicans have signed (yet another) letter, this one referring to the restrictions as “highly restrictive and onerous” and “overly prescriptive and risk undermining U.S. competitiveness.”

Should the FEOC provisions become law, their exact implementation will be up to the IRS. In the case of EVs, the tax agency came out with proposed guidelines in the months after the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted, but didn’t finalize them until 2024. Even complying with those required a “Herculean” effort from the EV and battery industry, Albert Gore, head of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told me.

Gore also questioned whether the rules would be “workable” as written. To determine whether compliance would be worth it, Gore said, you have to evaluate how close an industry is to complying in the present, and the value of complying in the future, and the cost to get there.

Given that the clean energy and manufacturing credits sunset after 2031 (except for wind components, which sunset earlier), that calculation may very well come out negative. And then there’s the deadline to even qualify for the clean energy tax credits in the first place, starting construction two months after the bill passes, according to the House language.

The EV rules did ultimately support U.S. manufacturing, Gore told me. “It was a pretty efficient investment in American manufacturing, kind of disguised as a consumer EV credit,” he said. “But it was a very, very stringent credit.”

Xan Fishman, senior managing director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, was skeptical that the FEOC provisions in the budget reconciliation bill would do anything to bolster U.S. manufacturing. “Intricate and complicated doesn’t make it more effective,” he told me.

“You would have a disallowance of credit if you are a foreign entity of concern, or you are a foreign influenced entity of concern, which might mean that one of your suppliers is a foreign entity of concern, or one of your supplier’s board members is from China or they have a family member that’s from China that runs a foreign entity of concern, or that family member has some business transaction involving debt with a foreign entity of concern, and their suppliers actually might have board members who have family members who have some debt arrangement with the foreign Institute of concern,” Fishman elaborated.

This is where workability really comes in.

“If the result of this is we have less U.S. manufacturing, we won’t have achieved the goal” of raising America’s global competitiveness. “Nor will we have been tough on China,” Fishman said.

The ironies of the legislation abound. “There's sort of that double whammy in there with the start of construction deadline, which to some extent, makes the FEOC moot,” Murphy, the Invenergy CEO, said at the conference. “If you don't start construction by the deadline, who cares about it?”

Ironically, if the Senate put in a more relaxed deadline to qualify for the credits, “then we have to really address those foreign entity of concern provisions,” Murphy added.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDkzODMzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzMyNjg3Mn0.zZ8HazjqEdExo2NqVv3BFjHoOrC0AiPfF8WvwRUMkME/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C200,N,,2025-06-13 15:03:12.160791

Job Growth and Trade Diversification Clean energy investments are both a job growth and economic diversification strategy.
Investments in clean energy create more jobs per dollar than investments in conventional energy sources.
By investing in clean energy, Canada will be able to attract more investment to diversify our economy and trade partners.","Concerns over the stability of the global economy are running high. Prime Minister Carney’s priority list for the upcoming G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta included energy security and stronger economic partnerships, both of which can be delivered with a focus on building the clean economy. Here’s how:

Cost Stability and Affordability

Clean energy economies run on localized renewable energy sources that are much less vulnerable to the fluctuating costs of imported energy commodities.

While most countries still rely on imported fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) for their energy mix, demand for clean energy is growing rapidly as the business case for electrification and clean energy gets better and better. Clean energy doesn’t just offer more stable energy costs, it’s cheaper, too. Renewables are already less expensive sources of power than fossil fuels and costs will continue to fall. In 2023, 81 percent of newly-commissioned renewable projects produced cheaper electricity than fossil fuel alternatives. And the cost of battery storage (which helps balance out intermittent energy sources like wind and solar in the electricity grid) is projected to drop by 50 percent by 2035. These factors have contributed to the rollout of renewables being even faster than anticipated. Global renewable capacity is on track to exceed countries’ current ambitions by nearly 25 percent by 2030.

Energy Security

With geopolitical tensions and trade under threat, localized clean energy is a good bet, according to the global investment firm the Carlyle Group. That’s because over half of fossil fuels are transported through three vulnerable trade chokepoints. Many countries are questioning the security of imported fuel supplies, and are instead prioritizing the clean economy, where they can reduce their risk by investing in manufacturing or importing tech once that allows them to generate their own power for decades.

Even though Canada has abundant energy of all kinds, we’re not immune to these concerns. Energy commodities are globally traded, meaning Canada can’t control the price — which impacts both producers and Canadian consumers. While we have security of supply, we don’t have cost security. Our electricity demand is projected to double by 2050, highlighting the need for resilient and reliable energy sources. Across the Canadian economy, sectors are increasingly electrifying due to the rapid adoption of new technologies (i.e., electric vehicles, arc furnaces for steel production, heat pumps for homes) and the expansion of new industries (data centres, carbon removal). Low-cost and low-risk clean energy sources can help Canada build the energy security — and cost stability — we need to provide Canadians with affordable energy and help our industries compete.

Job Growth and Trade Diversification

Clean energy investments are both a job growth and economic diversification strategy. Investments in clean energy create more jobs per dollar than investments in conventional energy sources. Investing in building efficiency and solar power, for example, respectively create 2.8 and 1.5 times as many jobs per dollar invested than investments in fossil fuels. And jobs in the clean energy sector in Canada are projected to grow four times faster than the national average.

By investing in clean energy, Canada will be able to attract more investment to diversify our economy and trade partners. Ontario and Quebec, provinces with abundant clean energy resources, have attracted major investments in electric vehicle and battery plants as well as the tech and life sciences sectors. Traditional industries like steel production and mining are using clean energy to decarbonize and optimize their products, making them more competitive to our trading partners who are looking for low-carbon materials. And our clean electricity grid is unlocking new carbon removal technology opportunities for Canada: the leading carbon removal firm Deep Sky recently announced a 10 year power purchase agreement with leading clean energy supplier Low Carbon to power its Alpha facility in Alberta.

Over the last few years, the US has been undergoing somewhat of a manufacturing renaissance.

Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, both of which included many provisions for green and domestic manufacturing jobs, there has been tremendous investment in US manufacturing, at a much higher pace than prior to those laws being passed.

Overall, Biden’s push for EVs attracted $210 billion in investment and 230,000 direct EV jobs, to say nothing of the additional jobs that would be created to support those jobs and due to increased economic activity.

This was particularly lucrative for certain states in particular, such as Nevada which would experience a 22.87% increase in the state’s manufacturing workforce, New Mexico with a 12.52% increase, or Georgia with a 10.17% boost. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia would all see a boost of more than 5% in their manufacturing workforces.

But the new budget bill, passed by republicans in the House, would kill all those jobs and more.

We’ve already seen some of these effects, as several projects have been canceled due to job-killing republican policy.

But now, a new analysis by BlueGreen Alliance calculates just how much the republican bill would devastate US manufacturing. It estimates that the elimination of manufacturing credits would threaten nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress. Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”

–Ted Fertik, Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy, BlueGreen Alliance.

But famously, manufacturing jobs are desirable because of their positive effect on a local economy, creating additional ancillary jobs in addition to the direct manufacturing jobs.

So, BlueGreen’s analysis looked at these as well, and found that a million “indirect jobs” would be threatened. Indirect jobs include things like supply chain jobs, providing parts for auto or clean energy manufacturing.

In addition, 643,000 “induced jobs” created by economic stimulus of the areas in question would be destroyed. These are jobs like restaurant workers, store clerks, and the other types of jobs you’d see when an area increases in population or has more money to spend.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price. As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

–Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance

Seven states would lose over 100,000 jobs, with California leading the pack at 329k, but three Southern states in the burgeoning US “battery belt” will be harmed exceptionally – Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina at 258k, 140k and 135k jobs lost respectively.

Notably, two of those states have two republican Senators – Tennessee and South Carolina. As the House bill has now been passed on to the Senate, it’s up to them whether they want to harm the economies of their state in order to satisfy their oil donors and give a multi-trillion-dollar giveaway to the richest Americans.

If you, perhaps, think that this bad idea is indeed a bad idea, you could get in contact with them to explain politely that you oppose sending US manufacturing jobs to China.

When designed with America’s national interest at heart, the IRA tax credits can deliver energy independence and an industrial revival.","In the final push to pass the Big Beautiful Bill, Congressional Republicans slashed clean energy tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It’s easy to see why. Over the last several years, billions in taxpayer subsidies werethrown to Biden insiders with little or no oversight. But the corrupt actions of the previous administration shouldn’t stand in the way of sound policy, and Congressional Republicans should understand that the elimination of these credits would be a tremendous mistake . America First conservatives should instead focus on reworking these incentives, to secure our energy independence and fortify America’s supply chains to strike a strategic economic blow against our international rivals.

The current structure of these credits is deeply flawed. It too often remunerates companies that import the cheapest available foreign components, do the bare minimum domestically, and then slap on a “Made in America” label. This not only misleads consumers, it leaves our supply chains vulnerable to economic coercion, geopolitical instability, and evenforced labor. Unfortunately, barring foreign companies from accessing the tax credits under Section 45X of the IRA misses the heart of the problem.

The solar industry is a perfect example. Here China dominates the supply chain for critical components like polysilicon, wafers, battery materials, and rare earth minerals, and it holds much of the intellectual property as well. Sourcing elsewhere is a practical impossibility. Even companies based in allied nations like South Korea and India still depend heavily upon Chinese inputs. The end result is that Chinese origin produced components continue to flood the U.S. market and American taxpayers foot the bill.

On paper, the “foreign entities of concern” (FEOC) provisions in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” sound like a political slam dunk. Ban materials from countries we don’t trust. Sounds good! But in practice, these measures backfire, crippling domestic supply chains and undercutting American jobs.

The FEOC rules impose rigid sourcing restrictions on critical components like polysilicon and battery materials. These are the building blocks of our energy future, and deep red states like Mississippi that have invested heavily in manufacturing will take the hit. There, Amplify Energy is seeking tolaunch a battery manufacturing facility that could support 2,000 good American jobs. Ill-considered blanket restrictions would impede these developments. Industry insiders estimate that these restrictions jeopardize over $200 billion in energy investments nationwide.

We need a way forward that protects those who would be the backbone of an America First energy policy. Instead of eliminating the tax credits, Congress should restructure them to reward companies that source from within the United States. Specifically, boosting the credit for polysilicon and wafer production would generate the level of investment needed to compete with China. A bonus credit for vertically integrated or fully domestic supply chains would further motivate domestic investment.

Of course, obstacles remain. To encourage the mining of rare earth minerals, the refining of lithium, and the production of polysilicon, our tax policy must be designed to encourage long-term investment. The Trump administration should invoke the Defense Production Act to speed up permitting and approval, while emphasizing the adoption of AI-powered manufacturing to bridge the gap where the United States isn’t yet ready to compete on the cost of labor.

Finally, IRA tax credits were tied to manufacturing, but not to the domestic control of the technology behind it. Republicans in Congress should introduce a targeted credit for domestic technology innovation while providing incentives for companies to assign or license core manufacturing intellectual property to an American entity.

Supply chain security, workforce development, and economic independence are essential to America’s future. When designed with America’s national interest at heart, the IRA tax credits can deliver energy independence and an industrial revival. This is the kind of strategic use of federal power that serves the people, not the elites. It’s how we rebuild the middle class and strengthen our sovereignty. Congressional Republicans who consider themselves champions of the America First agenda should naturally lead the charge on this front.

Launched this month, the $63.8 million GENESIS project brings together a coalition of 58 partners spanning manufacturers, SMEs, research institutes, and universities.

The program, led by France’s CEA-Leti, will run for three years and aims to address emissions, resource consumption, and supply chain resilience across the entire semiconductor lifecycle. In doing so, it aligns with Europe’s broader digital and green transition ambitions.

Building a Circular Economy for European Chips

Rather than tackling the problem piecemeal, GENESIS is structured around a comprehensive roadmap targeting five critical stages of chip manufacturing: materials development, chemical processes, waste monitoring and treatment, air emissions control, and final waste processing.

Real-time emissions tracking is one of the initiative’s key areas of focus. By advancing process monitoring and sensing technologies, GENESIS aims to enable manufacturers to spot environmental impacts during production—not after products are out the door.

Waste reduction is another priority. Researchers are working on advanced recycling systems to recover solvents, gases, and slurries that are typically discarded. At the same time, project teams are developing chemical alternatives that avoid PFAS and offer lower global warming potential, helping to clean up some of the sector’s most problematic processes.

The initiative also addresses Europe’s vulnerability around critical raw materials. GENESIS aims to develop technologies that reduce reliance on scarce inputs while strengthening supply chain resilience—goals that support both environmental and strategic policy objectives in the EU.

A Timely Play for European Competitiveness

The launch of GENESIS is well-timed. With chips now powering everything from AI systems to clean energy technologies, the environmental performance of semiconductor manufacturing is under growing scrutiny.

Laurent Pain, director of CEA-Leti’s Sustainable Electronics Program and project leader, says the consortium expects to deliver around 45 innovations designed to improve sustainability across the entire chip value chain.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250611-123051-94b-ioana-baciu-HNZb5jhftN0-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:01:53.159134

Energy ready to meet demand.
Energy ready to keep Indiana competitive.
That means slower progress in bringing new load online—a reality that runs counter to our national energy security goals.","When it comes to powering Indiana’s economy, Hoosiers understand what works: an all-of-the-above energy strategy rooted in reliability, readiness and growth. From traditional sources to renewable technologies like solar and battery storage, Indiana has never been about picking winners and losers. We’ve been about keeping the lights on and the job sites humming.

Today, a new wave of energy demand is cresting across our state. The growth of data centers, advanced manufacturing and defense-critical industries means the need for energy isn’t just coming—it’s already here. That power must come from somewhere, and increasingly, it comes from shovel-ready solar and battery energy storage projects.

As the CEO of a national energy development company with our operations hub proudly based in Indianapolis, I know firsthand that Indiana is one of the best places in America to get energy projects done. In just the past decade, Geenex has successfully developed more than 8 gigawatts of energy generation—enough to power more than a million homes. And right now, we have more than five additional gigawatts in development, including projects in 10 Hoosier counties.

That pipeline matters. Because the best kind of electron in today’s market isn’t a red one or a blue one—it’s a ready one. Energy ready to meet demand. Energy ready to keep Indiana competitive. Energy ready to protect our communities from future crises.

Unfortunately, proposals moving through Congress threaten to disrupt the very regulatory framework that has allowed Indiana to become a national leader in grid expansion and private energy investment. The House-passed budget bill, known as House Resolution 1, would modify the current landscape that provides the certainty to move forward.

Repealing provisions of the current tax credit structure risks slowing down energy projects that are already engineered, permitted and ready to begin construction. That means slower progress in bringing new load online—a reality that runs counter to our national energy security goals.

We know what those goals are because President Donald Trump outlined them clearly in his recent executive orders: Build American energy. Cut permitting delays. Restore energy independence. Secure our supply chains.

We agree. And in Indiana, we’re doing it.

Hoosier workers are building the energy backbone of the future. From the steel mills supplying project components to the union trades installing megawatts of generation capacity, energy is not a concept—it’s a paycheck, a plant expansion, a child’s future in Indiana.

This is not the time to change course. Let’s keep Indiana on the path of energy leadership by staying focused on what matters: readiness, reliability and results. That means keeping a clear regulatory path for projects already in motion and ensuring that Indiana can continue to meet the growing energy demands of the 21st-century economy. The U.S. Senate still has time to act.

When the next job announcement drops or the next facility seeks to locate in Indiana, we won’t have time to waste. We’ll need power on the ground, electrons on the line, and Hoosiers ready to deliver.•

XGS Energy has yet to say where it’ll be building the power plant, and Meta wouldn’t disclose specifics about the deal other than to say it’s not yet a contract to purchase power, but rather an agreement “to advance geothermal energy development” in the state, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Recently, tech companies, data center developers, and investors have been warming to the technology. Geothermal can generate electricity around the clock without producing emissions, an appealing combination to hyperscalers.

Advanced geothermal, which drills deeper to access hotter rocks, could generate enough electricity in the U.S. to fulfill nearly two-thirds of new data center demand by 2030, according to the Rhodium Group.

Many geothermal startups are pursuing open loop designs, where they inject water down one well and let it flow through cracks in the rock before extracting it from another well. Over time, some of that water is lost to the ground.

XGS Energy, on the other hand, sends water through a closed loop inside a sealed well, minimizing water loss. It also injects a proprietary mud around the outside of the well casing to help transfer more heat from the rocks to the loop.

The partnership between XGS Energy and Meta is the latest in a string of deals racked up by geothermal startups.

On Wednesday, Fervo Energy secured $206 million in financing to continue work on its Cape Station power plant, which, when finished, will be the largest geothermal power plant in the world. The company’s momentum has fueled speculation that it may go public as early as next year.

In April, Google said it was buying 10 megawatts of geothermal from Baseload Capital to power its operations in Taiwan. The search giant also has a deal with Fervo to supply electricity for its Nevada data centers.

The Environmental Protection Agency released its long-awaited renewable volume obligation proposal for 2026 and 2027, which included historic increases in biomass-based diesel volumes and recommendations to strengthen domestic markets for U.S. soybean farmers.

“As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the American Soybean Association applauds the work of President Trump, Administrator Zeldin and Secretary Rollins in promoting American energy dominance and strengthening a key domestic market for U.S. soybean farmers,” said Caleb Ragland, ASA President and soybean farmer from Magnolia, Kentucky. “The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors, and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities. We thank the Trump Administration for recognizing and supporting this vital value chain for U.S. agriculture.”

The proposed rule makes significant increases in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel, from 3.35 billion gallons in 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026, or a 67% increase. For years, ASA and others in the domestic biofuel value chain argued that the previous renewable volume obligations missed the mark and did not account for the feedstock availability nor production capacity. If finalized, this proposal would jumpstart a biofuel industry that has largely been crippled by weak Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit values.

Additionally, EPA proposed a new concept to discount the RIN credit value for foreign finished fuel and fuels produced using foreign feedstocks. As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain.

Tesla semis, just the cab, can weigh between 19,000 and 22,000 pounds.","President Donald Trump has had one California policy circled on his list for some time.

Shortly after Trump won the election, his transition team was already making plans to eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EV purchases enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act.

On November 14, just nine days after winning the election, Trump's team told Reuters that he planned to take away the tax credit enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act.

California Governor Gavin Newsom saw the opportunity to let President Trump and the world know exactly where he stands on the issue.

A few weeks following the Reuters report, Newsom announced on Nov. 25 that if Trump followed through on his threat, the state of California will revive a program that gave its state residents up to $7,500 for EVs.

But on Thursday, June 12, Trump, who has been publicly feuding with Newsom for days over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration raids that have targeted Los Angeles in recent days, did what he could to kill that tax incentive as well.

The ICE raids have resulted in protests that have seen flashes of violence. This has allowed an opening for President Trump to call in the National Guard to quash the protests.

As the two have gone back and forth on social media, Trump used the power of the pen Thursday to get the upper hand on his political rival.

On Thursday, President Trump signed three resolutions barring California from mandating EV sales and setting stringent tailpipe exhaust emission standards to hasten the transition to EVs.

The resolutions revoke the federal waiver allowing California to set its own emission standards under the Clean Air Act. California had also planned to ban new gasoline car sales by 2035, but Trump's resolution also takes that off the table.

The 17 states that adopted California's standards will also no longer be able to mandate EV sales by 2035.

“We officially rescued the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said Thursday.

The president said “the trucking industry“ told him that EV trucks do not work because the vehicles are so heavy, thanks to the large batteries that power them.

According to Trump, EV semis are more than 2.5 times heavier than their diesel counterparts. He went on to say that the U.S. would have to rebuild every bridge in America because they weren't designed for that weight.

This isn't the first time President Trump has claimed EVs will force trillions of dollars in road repairs and improvements across the country.

Federal weight limits allow vehicles that weigh as much as 80,000 pounds, including cargo, on the road and put as much as 20,000 pounds of weight on a single axle.

A diesel tractor weighs between 10,000 and 25,000 pounds, while the empty trailer weighs another 10,000. Tesla semis, just the cab, can weigh between 19,000 and 22,000 pounds. Add a 10,000-pound trailer, and the weight could limit how much cargo each truck can safely and legally hold.

California governor responds to latest Trump jab

Gavin Newsom has been very active on social media over the past week, defending his state from barbs thrown by Republicans over the ICE protests that have sometimes turned violent.

He told NBC that the state will be suing to “stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Trump, meanwhile, sees the move as a commonsense step to help the auto industry.

But he also took the time to give a light tap to his on-again, off-again friend Elon Musk, who owns the world's most valuable EV company.

“Now we know why Elon doesn’t like me so much, which he does.

“While this proposal has some significant program changes that will require further study for us to better understand, over all it reflects the strength, resilience, and growth potential of America’s biodiesel industry. The volumes signal real opportunity for domestic producers, especially here in Iowa, and we appreciate the EPA’s recognition of what this industry is capable of delivering.

“For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running. That’s good news for jobs, for soybean farmers and for communities that rely on biofuels as a driver of economic growth.

“While what happens with small refinery exemptions remains to be seen and is very important to the final outcome, today’s news overall is a win for clean energy, agriculture and American manufacturing.”

Kimberley also thanked Iowa’s Congressional delegation — Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, and Representatives Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Randy Feenstra, and Zach Nunn — for their continued leadership and unified support for Iowa’s biofuel producers and soybean growers.

During panel discussions and interviews at Sustainability Week USA, Economist Impact’s clean tech conference, clean energy consultants expressed frustration over recent setbacks, as well as determination to stay the course.

David Turk, deputy secretary of the Department of Energy during the Biden administration, said in his keynote that he wished Congress had passed the IRA earlier, so Republican districts could have seen the impacts sooner.

“The reason why I don’t think [the IRA] influenced that many Republican representatives—in fact, it influenced zero at the end of the day in terms of who voted, who threatened to vote against the package—was that it wasn’t the jobs already there and they were being pulled back,” Turk told the event’s audience. “It was just jobs that were coming there in a year or two, and it just makes it that much less compelling.”

Similarly, Bipartisan Climate Trust advisor Robin Millican said that “telling people you should fight for these things because it creates jobs” was an uphill battle, especially with Republican representatives voting along party lines. “It is really hard to do climate policy through the tax code,” she said, which is vulnerable to political swings.

“What we’ve had is this very much boom and bust cycle where a tax credit is available and then it gets rescinded, and I think it’s really hard for industry to plan around that with certainty,” Millican said in a panel discussion.

Or maybe it was how the law was branded, Galvanize Climate Solutions’ Chief Strategy Officer David Livingston said: Something like “the Energy Freedom Tax Cut Act,” because in this situation, “semantics matter.”

No matter what, it’s not over, the credits are currently good law—and ClearPath CEO Jeremy Harrell said he actually feels optimistic about how things will play out in the Senate. ClearPath is a conservative clean energy organization.

“I just took the train from DC this morning. I think things are trending in a better direction on the Senate side,” Harrell said during a panel discussion. “You are going to see many of these [incentives] stay in place, particularly for key technologies that we know we need from a climate perspective.”

That’s because, according to Harrell, rising energy demand will drive the need for all forms of energy.

“We can build once we get out of this place,” he said, “and drive forward on things like permit reform that are going to be necessary to scale up new technology.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/3f3dec77d5a88b10d87bdcb1c959b0350ae777ea-2481x1729.jpg?rect=0,213,2481,1303&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-13 14:00:30.177399

From the May/June 2025 Issue

Over the past year, the United States auto industry has started to bounce back after several years of turbulence. According to the Kroll Automotive Industry Report in spring 2024, new vehicle sales have surged, with estimates showing a 12-15% increase compared to 2023, as supply chain distributions, particularly the semiconductor shortage, eased significantly. This allowed automakers to restock their dealer lots and reduce customer wait times, fueling demand. The used vehicle market stabilized, with prices cooling from the record highs seen during the pandemic, although demand for affordable used models remained strong.

The electric vehicle (EV) market continues to grow, capturing around 9-10% of total U.S. sales in 2024. Federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, improvements in battery range, and a rapid expansion of charging infrastructure all contributed to this growth. Hybrids saw a resurgence with customers drawn to their combination of fuel efficiency and lack of range anxiety compared to full electric vehicles.

The luxury and premium segments also had strong gains, boosted by affluent consumers less affected by high interest rates. Fleet sales, which had been depressed during the pandemic, rebound as rental car companies, commercial fleets, and government agencies replaced aging vehicles.

Beyond consumer sales, production capacity grew as automakers opened or expanded factories, particularly in EV battery production, often through joint ventures with battery makers. A major driver of production growth came from electric vehicle transition. Automakers significantly expanded EV production capacity by investing in new plants and upgrading existing ones to accommodate electric models.

Automakers increased reshoring of parts production. They invested in modernizing plants with advanced robotics, more flexible manufacturing systems, and digital tools to boost efficiency. This not only expanded capacity but improved the ability to shift between gasoline, hybrid, and electric models as market demand fluctuated.

The commercial vehicle sector also saw capacity growth, particularly for electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies like Rivian, who is partnered with Amazon; BrightDrop, partnered with GM; and Ford scaled up production to meet the rising demand from e-commerce and logistics companies.

As the price of oil moves toward $70 per barrel, U.S. domestic oil producers will increase volume, dampening the overall impact of hostilities in the Middle East.","The U.S. has been a net exporter of oil since 2019 and energy independent for the better part of the past 15 years.

Now, with hostilities having broken out in the Middle East, this resilience will help the U.S. economy weather the impact of any increase in global energy prices.

Still, the U.S. is not immune to volatility in global energy markets.

About 20% of oil and natural gas flows through the Strait of Hormuz, and Iran still produces 3% global oil supplies.

Read more of RSM’s insights on the economy and the middle market.

The region remains a vital component of global energy markets, so when this trade is disrupted, American consumers will be affected.

Higher oil prices mean higher prices at the pump, which pushes up inflation and, if sustained, restrains economic growth.

Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil should result in a 0.1 percentage-point increase in inflation and cause a 0.1% drag on overall growth.

Should current conditions hold—an uncertain assumption—the consumer price index would increase to 2.5% at a minimum in June from the current 2.4% and economic growth would be dragged down.

Overall, the impact on the U.S. economy will be muted, but the risks of the conflict expanding remain.

Any increase in oil prices will be quickly passed through to the pump within a matter of days. These higher prices will show up most likely during the week of June 15.

As of Friday morning, the 8% increase in the price of domestically produced oil implies only a modest adjustment in gasoline prices. But given that the conflict might continue, the risk of greater disruption in energy markets is only heightened.

Energy independence

Domestic oil dynamics imply that should oil prices move toward $70 per barrel, production volume will increase.

The price of West Texas Intermediate oil—the domestic benchmark—over the past few months dropped to around $60 to $65, near the average breakeven price for much of U.S. crude oil production.

That breakeven level is a reflection of domestic energy independence as American oil production now stands at 13.4 million barrels per day, 22% higher than five years ago.

This drop in prices stems from an expected global economic slowdown following the shift in U.S. trade policy that would restrain oil demand at the same time that global oil supplies remain strong.

In response to the lower price outlook, oil producers have cut back on their drilling. This is best reflected by the fastest reduction since 2023.

With oil in the $60 to $70 range, producers are simply in “yellow light” territory, taking their foot off the gas pedal.

But should the breakout of hostilities in the Middle East cause oil prices to exceed $70, the higher-price environment would be a green light for producers.

We think that small to midsize producers tend to be more agile than larger ones and will be better positioned to respond to higher prices.

Three scenarios

Because this is a fluid situation, it is necessary to map out the impact on the U.S. economy from a large increase in the price of oil.

The following shows three scenarios in which oil prices increase. In our estimation each scenario, given the risks around rising geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, shows the risk of higher gasoline prices, higher inflation and a greater drag on growth.

Oil Increases to $80: A $12 increase in the price of domestic oil from the $68.04 close on June 12 should result in a 5% increase in the cost of domestic gasoline to near $3.41 per gallon. That would result in an increase in the June consumer price index to a minimum of 2.6% on a year-ago basis, which could increase at a greater pace because of tariffs and exert a modest drag of 0.1% on growth in the second quarter.

Oil Increases to $100: This scenario would result in a 15% increase in the price of regular gasoline to $3.73 per gallon and a 2.7% annual increase in the consumer price index in June, with a higher rate possible because of tariffs. The result would be a 0.3% drag on second-quarter growth.

Oil Increases to $120: This scenario would result in a 3% increase in the year-over-year CPI as the cost of domestic gasoline increases by 20% to $3.90 per gallon and provides a 0.5% drag on overall growth in the second quarter.

Inflation expectations, interest rates and the Fed

The primary risk to the rate outlook is through inflation expectations becoming unanchored.

The New York Federal Reserve’s estimate of one-year inflation expectations stands at 3.2% and the University of Michigan estimate of one-year expectations resides at 5.1%.

Most important, should consumers push near-term expectations higher, then the Federal Reserve will almost certainly push out any notion of a rate cut until December at the earliest, or into next year.

We think that the Fed will keep its policy rate in a range between 4.25% and 4.5% at its meeting next week. A move higher in inflation would modestly impact our estimation of the Fed’s reaction function but would not be sufficient to warrant a sharp change in policy.

But a sharp change in policy would be warranted only if inflation expectations become unanchored and inflation moves decisively to the upside on a combination of tariffs and an oil-induced price shock.

Given the new tariffs and rising energy prices, the Fed should simply wait out the current volatility before acting in either direction.

On Friday, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield moved higher, to 4.41%, as investors priced in greater inflation risks while the U.S. dollar appreciated against 14 of the 16 major trading currencies.

The takeaway

The U.S. has established energy independence, and this is one of the reasons why our shock-based scenarios result in a relatively restrained economic impact of the current events in the Middle East.

As the price of oil moves toward $70 per barrel, U.S. domestic oil producers will increase volume, dampening the overall impact of hostilities in the Middle East.

Should hostilities expand to affect other oil producers in the Middle East, then the adverse impact on the domestic price of energy would be greater than that estimated above.",https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6_13_2025_energy_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 14:02:05.196850

About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson to allow a floor vote on House Bill 6207, widely known as the “Bottle Bill.” The group emphasized the bill’s critical importance for environmental protection and recycling infrastructure in the state, expressing frustration over its current legislative stagnation.

House Bill 6207, introduced on April 9, 2025, aims to establish an extended producer responsibility (EPR) program for packaging and paper products, alongside a comprehensive beverage container recycling refund system (often referred to as a “bottle deposit program”). Despite strong support from environmental advocacy groups like Environment Rhode Island, Save The Bay, Clean Water Action and Zero Waste and an extensive study by a joint legislative commission, the bill was “held for further study” by the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee on May 13, 2025, effectively stalling its progress.

“This isn’t just about littered bottles on our beaches or overflowing recycling bins,” stated Representative McEntee, the sponsor of H6207. “This bill represents a tangible solution to a growing environmental crisis, and it has been thoroughly vetted. To let it languish in committee is a disservice to our constituents and our future.”

The press conference, held in the Rhode Island State Capitol, saw several legislators speak passionately about the need for immediate action. They highlighted that the proposed legislation would shift the financial burden of waste management to producers, incentivize the use of recycled materials, and significantly boost Rhode Island’s recycling rates.

“We’ve seen successful bottle bills in other states dramatically reduce litter and improve recycling,” added Senator McKenny. “Rhode Islanders deserve the same opportunity to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable state. It’s time for the leadership to bring this to a vote and let the full General Assembly decide.”

The lawmakers underscored that the bill reflects the recommendations of an 18-month legislative study commission specifically tasked with addressing plastic waste and recycling solutions in Rhode Island. This pre-legislative work, they argued, should expedite its passage, not hinder it.

The press conference concluded with a unified call for transparency and democratic process within the General Assembly. “We are here today to respectfully, but firmly, ask Speaker Shekarchi and President Lawson to prioritize this vital legislation,” said Representative McEntee. “Allowing a floor vote on H6207 is not just about this bill; it’s about empowering the legislative body to act on issues that deeply impact our communities and our environment.”

Supporters of H6207 are now looking to the public to amplify their message, encouraging citizens to contact their representatives and the legislative leadership to demand a vote on the “Bottle Bill.” The future of Rhode Island’s recycling system, they contend, hinges on whether this critical legislation is finally allowed to see the light of day.",https://environmentamerica.org/rhodeisland/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_RIE.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:11.365607

Senator Graham’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act is a smart way to protect South Carolina workers and spur our state’s leadership in clean manufacturing.","With the reconciliation debate in full swing and the fate of clean energy subsidies hanging in the balance, many environmentally minded conservatives like myself are paying careful attention to the US Senate. However, as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” continues to absorb much of America’s attention, one very positive development has gone overlooked in the media, and it promises to be a win for South Carolina’s energy and manufacturing sectors.

I’m talking about the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (FPFA), a bill introduced in April by Senator Bill Cassidy and sponsored by our own Senator Lindsey Graham. The bill would impose tariffs according to the pollution level required to manufacture foreign goods, ensuring that our manufacturers are not undercut by competitors who cut corners on environmental standards.

There’s a reason Senator Graham sponsored this legislation both this Congress and last—the Foreign Pollution Fee Act has the potential to significantly benefit South Carolina and raise revenue to offset tax breaks.

Right now, South Carolina is at a global disadvantage. While our state’s growing manufacturing sector plays by the rules, foreign competitors—especially China—undercut our producers by ignoring environmental standards and flooding our markets with artificially cheap goods.

Not only does this make it difficult for South Carolina businesses to compete, but pollution from other nations also negatively impacts our air and water while contributing to climate change. Our current trade laws effectively subsidize dirty foreign countries by refusing to hold foreign imports with zero environmental standards to the same bar that we expect of South Carolina manufacturers.

Senator Graham’s FPFA would protect South Carolina workers by ensuring foreign manufacturers pay the same environmental compliance costs South Carolina businesses are required to pay. This has the potential to not only reward South Carolina’s efforts in environmental stewardship and energy independence but also protect our manufacturers and workers from the unfair environmental practices of other nations.

The impact of this bill may be more evident than in the advanced energy sector. In addition to our over 270,000 manufacturing jobs – including those in landmark auto manufacturing facilities in Greer and Ridgeville – our state has more than 46,000 clean energy jobs. That number is only growing, especially because South Carolina has a robust clean energy infrastructure. This includes seven nuclear reactors producing over half of our energy in a carbon-free way, the University of South Carolina’s hydrogen and fuel cell research center, and the newly opened ES Foundry solar cell factory in Greenwood, which is set to become the largest such factory in the United States. This solar cell factory is particularly notable because panels made here in South Carolina will produce drastically less pollution than Chinese solar panels advertised as “net-zero,” but made with dirty coal power.

With the FPFA, businesses like these will be free from worrying about unscrupulous competitors that ignore environmental standards and can focus on increasing these clean energy investments here in South Carolina.

Such investments are especially important as countries like China are laser-focused on dominating the clean energy market (ironically, it is a leader in clean energy technology innovation, even while its economy remains remarkably dirty). We can keep those energy jobs here at home. Along with other trade fixes and targeted investments, this move would help the United States be the undisputed leader in the energy of the future.

Unlike other clean energy plans that rely on top-down, economically damaging federal regulations, a foreign pollution fee puts a simple price tag on environmental uncleanness and then lets the market do the rest. It is one of the only environmental tools that promises to raise a significant amount of money, which may be helpful as Congress sorts out its tax agenda.

Here in South Carolina, we know that fair trade is the best trade, that economic growth is the key to prosperity, and that we can have both of those goods, all while defending our environment. Senator Graham’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act is a smart way to protect South Carolina workers and spur our state’s leadership in clean manufacturing.

""We were thinking about rapid expansion of electric vehicles, and clearly we haven't seen that happen.
""We have such a customer-focused portfolio of gas-powered vehicles or electric vehicles,"" she added.
The EV models of both the Equinox and Blazer — as well as the luxury Cadillac Optiq — are made in Mexico.
Equinox and Blazer accounted for some 50% of GM's EV sales, with roughly 22,000 and 11,000 sold through May, respectively.","General Motors Co.'s $4 billion reshoring plan announced this week sketches a blueprint for the Detroit automaker's long-term strategy: ramp up production of the hulking gas-powered vehicles Americans love while growing its expanding fleet of electric vehicles.

The investment to shift production of popular models from Mexico to three U.S. plants is the latest instance of GM tapping the brakes on EVs in response to slower-than-expected growth amid tariffs and federal efforts to scale back emissions regulations and EV incentives.

GM's latest vision for the Orion Assembly Plant, unveiled Tuesday as part of the $4 billion reshoring announcement, represents the company's biggest pullback on electrification yet. Instead of producing EV trucks as previously announced, the Oakland County facility will build gas-powered large SUVs and pickups starting in 2027.

""We had planned for that to be a big EV plant,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a Wednesday investor call. ""We were thinking about rapid expansion of electric vehicles, and clearly we haven't seen that happen. So as we look at that capacity (and) we look at the landscape where we are in pivoting that to full-size truck production as well as incremental full-size SUV production, it's going to help create and satisfy the demand that we've already seen in the marketplace for our industry-leading products.""

GM is following a dual track with EVs and ICEs, necessitated in part by slow consumer acceptance of battery-powered models. But its profit-rich trucks and SUVs generate the cash GM needs to fund its EV and battery aspirations.

""Ten years ago, all the manufacturers saw the success of Tesla and expected the market to shift towards electric vehicles, and so they prepared for this new wave of buyers,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of the research firm AutoForecast Solutions. ""That shift was never going to happen. And there was going to be an extended period where gas engines were required to keep their volumes up, to keep sales, (and) to keep customers happy.""

GM's decision to walk away from its $4 billion plan to convert Orion to EV production, announced in 2022, is the automaker's latest move to slow its shift to electrification — and recognize shifting consumer preferences and the prevailing political sentiment of the second Trump era.

Plans to make Tonawanda Propulsion all EV were tossed in May in favor of manufacturing the latest V-8, gas-powered engines at the Buffalo, New York, plant. In April, GM announced plans to beef up capacity at a Toledo plant to build transmissions for gas-powered trucks while pulling out some equipment that had been installed recently to make drive systems for electric vehicles.

""What we're about is offering customers choice,"" CEO Mary Barra told Fox Business last month. ""We have great internal combustion engines, or gas vehicles. We have great EV vehicles. We're meeting the customer in the marketplace where they are.

""We have such a customer-focused portfolio of gas-powered vehicles or electric vehicles,"" she added. ""We're growing both.""

Trucks, SUVs and the draw of V-8s

As lawmakers and policymakers pushed for increasing regulations on fuel efficiency, emissions and other environmentally friendly rules, Fiorani said some drivers responded with renewed interest in size and power.

""Since the 80s, we've seen this need to make more efficient vehicles,"" Fiorani said. ""And buyers have pushed back by attempting to buy the largest, most powerful, the loudest engine they could.""

Ram learned to appreciate customers' devotion to V-8s the hard way, Fiorani said, after dropping its famed 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 from its 1500 lineup and replacing it with six-cylinder engines in 2025. Outrage ensued, and Ram sales overall plummeted 19% last year.

Ram ""screwed up"" when it dropped the engine, Stellantis NV truck brand CEO Tim Kuniskis said last week when announcing the Hemi's return to the 2026 Ram 1500 lineup.

GM's top-selling vehicles in the first three months of 2025 included the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, the latter of which has an option for a V-8 engine. Those are ""high-volume, high-margin vehicles,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights for Cox Automotive.

Fiorani added: ""Buyers expect to have a large truck and a powerful engine under the hood, and part of that experience is the noise that a V-8 makes. It announces that, this is what I own, and this is what I drive.""

Under GM's $4 billion reshoring plan, the company will produce full-size SUVs and light-duty pickups in Orion; build the gas-powered Equinox compact SUV in Fairfax, Kansas; and assemble the gas-powered Blazer in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

""Talking about trucks and SUVs compared to the small cars we were into, everybody's excited,"" said Gerald Lang, president of United Auto Workers Local 5960 at GM Lake Orion. ""There's a lot of people that had to transfer out with this retooling that are looking forward to coming home.""

Easing GM's way are dirt-cheap gas prices that give drivers little incentive to ditch gas guzzlers.

""Making sure they have all these options for the consumer is the best recipe for success in the next decade or more,"" Fiorani said. ""And GM is finally realizing that the electric market isn't going to be here tomorrow, and buyers are going to expect to have a V-8-powered pickup truck.""

Electrification

Despite low margins, analysts say GM must continue to invest in EVs to be competitive in the upcoming decades, particularly against intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.

GM trails industry leader Tesla Inc. But the Detroit automaker is gaining traction as buyers grow tired of dated models and CEO Elon Musk's politics.

GM on Tuesday announced it claimed a distant second place in U.S. EV sales through May. Part of the draw is the wide variety of EVs offered under the Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet brands, including the affordable Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer. The EV models of both the Equinox and Blazer — as well as the luxury Cadillac Optiq — are made in Mexico.

Equinox and Blazer accounted for some 50% of GM's EV sales, with roughly 22,000 and 11,000 sold through May, respectively. Altogether, GM currently fields 11 EV models, including the hand-built Celestiq.

Aiding recent sales overall is buyer anxiety that Trump's tariffs would lead to price hikes. EV drivers also face the threat of Congress axing the $7,500 tax incentives and cancelling federal support to expand the nation's charging network.

The Republican president enacted a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and auto parts from Canada and Mexico that do not comply with the countries' U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.

He granted the USMCA exemption after intense lobbying and direct conversations with leaders of the Detroit Three automakers. The companies warned of dire consequences from disrupting North America's highly interconnected automotive supply chain, with Michigan likely to suffer the most.

""All of these factors are weighing on the decision-making of buyers today,"" Fiorani said. ""If they believe that they're going to need a vehicle in the next few months, a lot of them have moved to the dealership now to purchase while they believe the prices will be lower.""

Jacobson said GM does not expect the April and May spikes, thanks to pull-ahead vehicle sales in both gas and electric models, to continue through June.

""We've certainly seen that come back down,"" Jacobson said. ""The question out of earnings is going to be: how far does that come down?""

Despite growth, EV sales have not met automakers' optimistic expectations. All-electric vehicle purchases still hover around 10% of the U.S. car market, forcing GM to retreat from a short-lived promise for a fully electric fleet by 2035.

""The industry is still committed,"" Valdez Streaty said. ""There's just going to be shifts in the timeline.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/06/13/BIZ-AUTO-GM-RESHORING-TRUCKS-SUVS-DTN_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-06-13 14:02:57.662178

A tug of war on emissions regulations on power plants The proposed repeal of certain regulations on power plants are part of a tug of war between the Trump and the Obama and Biden Administrations.
Back in 2015, President Obama’s EPA releases the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was the first-ever regulation to limit GHG emissions from U.S. power plants.
According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. electric power emissions stayed flat over the past few decades, driven by decreasing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, which offsets the increasing emissions from natural gas-fired power plants.

The Trump Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced two proposals to repeal existing U.S. regulations on power plants, including all existing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) regulations and certain amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

EPA estimates that the proposed repeal of all GHG regulations on power plants would save compliance costs between $9.6–$19 billion (in 2024 dollars) and lead to PM2.5 (fine inhalable particulate matter) and ozone-related health costs of $76–$130 billion; most striking is that the agency does not provide any monetized estimates associated with the increased GHG emissions from the proposed rule.

If the proposed rules are finalized, they will be subject to substantial legal challenges across the country, which would create significant policy uncertainty for players in the U.S. electricity market, such as investors, energy developers, and utilities.

Introduction

The Trump Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced two proposals to repeal existing U.S. regulations on power plants, including all existing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) regulations and certain amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

EPA’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) estimates that the proposed repeal of all GHG regulations on power plants would save compliance costs between $9.6–$19 billion (in 2024 dollars) and lead to PM2.5 (fine inhalable particulate matter) and ozone-related health costs of $76–$130 billion; most striking is that the agency does not provide any monetized estimates associated with the increased GHG emissions from the proposed rule.

If the proposed rules are finalized, they will be subject to substantial legal challenges across the country, which would create significant policy uncertainty for players in the U.S. electricity market, such as investors, energy developers, and utilities.

Proposal To Repeal Obama and Biden Regulations on Power Plants

Policy goal

The EPA press release on the proposed rule states the goal of the rule as:

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential.

Rationale

The proposed rule states the following consideration behind the Trump Administration’s decision to not regulate GHG emissions from power plants:

Unlike other air pollutants with a regional or local impact, the targeted emissions are global in nature. As a result, any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector.

Proposed actions

The proposed rule summarizes the EPA’s planned actions as:

“…proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.”

“…proposing that the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires it to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution, as a predicate to regulating GHG emissions from those plants.”

“…further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

“…also proposing, as an alternative, to repeal a narrower set of requirements that includes the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines.”

Under the first proposed action, EPA seeks to repeal all existing GHG emissions regulations on U.S. power plants, including:

The Obama Administration’s regulation issued on October 23, 2015: New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for coal and gas power plants.

The Biden Administration’s regulations issued on May 9, 2024: Specifically, promulgated in the Carbon Pollution Standards (CPS), NSPS for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and new gas power plants, as well as emission guidelines for existing coal-, oil-, and gas-fired steam generating units.

The second and third proposed actions are linked. The former proposes to require the EPA to find that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution” before issuing relevant regulations. The latter proposes that GHG emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

The fourth action proposes to repeal additional standards in Biden’s CPS, including the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines. As part of this proposal, the EPA will take public comments on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

A cost-benefit analysis that excludes GHG emissions impact

EPA’s regulatory impact analysis (RIA) provides estimates of the associated quantified benefits and costs in dollar value for the proposed rule and concludes that “the net benefits are negative using the economy-wide cost estimate.”

Here are some selected estimates in the analysis:

“Compliance costs saving”: EPA estimates the proposed rule would save between $9.6–$19 billion (in 2024 dollars).

“CO2 Emissions Changes”: EPA projects that U.S. power plants’ CO2 emissions would increase from the baseline with Biden Administration’s CPS regulation by 38 million metric tons (MMT) in 2028, 50 MMT in 2030, 123 MMT in 2035, 54 MMT in 2040, and 42 MMT in 2045.

“Energy market impacts”: As shown in Table 1 below, EPA provides energy market analysis of the proposed rule similar to the analysis of Biden’s CPS regulation, including price and production projections of electricity, natural gas, and coal for 2028, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045. Of note, the numbers across the two sets of RIAs are the same, but their signs are the opposite. As explained in the analysis by Trump’s EPA, “The proposed action would reverse these potential impacts, so the signs on these projected impacts are the opposite from what they were in the 2024 CPS RIA.” As a result, Trump’s EPA projects that if the proposed rule goes into effect, U.S. coal production for power sector use will increase by 84 percent from the baseline with Biden’s CPS.

“PM5 and Ozone-Related Human Health Benefits”: The estimates in this section are as confusing to interpret as the section title itself. The total estimated “PM2.5 and O3-related health benefits” is between -$76 billion to -$130 billion in present value. In other words, the health costs of PM2.5 and ozone-related mortality and illness between $76–$130 billion. While the Biden RIA of the CPS regulation provides positive number estimates of potentially avoided ozone-related and particulate matter (PM)-related premature deaths, all the estimate numbers are negative in Trump’s RIA. The analysis states that “Estimates of avoided premature mortalities due to this proposed action quantified using the described approach are provided…. Negative numbers indicate avoided premature mortalities that are estimated to no longer occur under this proposed action.” As a result, all the economic-value estimates of the “avoided pm2.5 and ozone-related attributable premature mortality and illnesses” are also negative.

“Non-Monetized Disbenefits”: EPA does not provide dollar-value estimates of the costs, or “disbenefits” as labeled in the analysis, of the negative impacts resulting from the proposed rule, such as increases in Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) and GHG emissions, changes in water quality and availability, or ecosystems changes. It is most striking that the Trump Administration does not provide any analysis of the costs of the increased GHG emissions associated with the repeal of the emissions regulations. In contrast, the Biden Administration calculated the total climate benefits of reducing GHG emissions to be $270 billion from 2028–2047 (in 2019 dollars).

Proposal To Repeal Amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards

Policy goal

EPA states that:

This proposed action would enhance efforts to Restore American Energy Dominance by removing costly burdens on coal- and oil-fired power plants while still accomplishing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

Proposed actions

The rule proposes to:

“Repeal certain amendments issued on May 7, 2024, to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units – a rule commonly known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants, or simply MATS.”

“…revert back to 2012 standards that have driven sharp reductions in harmful air toxic pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.”

“…relieve all facilities of the more stringent filterable particulate matter (PM) emission standard for coal-fired EGUs, the tighter mercury standard for lignite-fired EGUs, and the requirement to use PM Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).”

Regulatory impact

EPA estimates that this proposed rule would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years, which is about $120 million per year.

Analysis

Trump Administration’s energy and environmental approach

EPA’s proposals to repeal the above regulations on U.S. power plants are aligned with the administration’s overall approach to energy and environmental policy, which is to provide strong support for certain energy sources including fossil fuels and nuclear energy. On day one of President Trump’s second term, he signed several energy-related executive orders (EOs) intended to boost U.S. oil and gas production and exports by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulatory barriers, and expediting permitting approval for oil and gas projects. On April 8, 2025, he signed several EOs intended to significantly boost U.S. production of “beautiful, clean” coal. On May 23, 2025, he signed several EOs intended to promote U.S. deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Additionally, the two proposals are a follow up on EPA’s announcement in March to plan to strike down the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding, which was the agency’ original legal basis for regulating GHG emissions. Previous American Action Forum analysis explains what the endangerment finding is, potential arguments to rescind the finding, and its implications.

A tug of war on emissions regulations on power plants

The proposed repeal of certain regulations on power plants are part of a tug of war between the Trump and the Obama and Biden Administrations.

Back in 2015, President Obama’s EPA releases the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was the first-ever regulation to limit GHG emissions from U.S. power plants.

In February 2016, a majority of the Supreme Court voted to stay the CPP in a case brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce against the EPA, which prevented it from being implemented.

In 2019, President Trump’s EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.

In 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ACE and its repeal of the CPP.

In 2022, however, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in West Virginia v. EPA and ruled that EPA lacks the statutory authority to implement the CPP. As a result, the CPP repeal was upheld and the ACE reinstated.

On May 9, 2024, President Biden’s EPA promulgated the CPS, including new emission guidelines and standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and repealing the ACE.

How much does the power sector contribute to GHG emissions?

GHG emissions from the power sector accounts for about a quarter of total U.S. emissions. According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. electric power emissions stayed flat over the past few decades, driven by decreasing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, which offsets the increasing emissions from natural gas-fired power plants.

Regulations are costly and inefficient

Sector-based federal regulations are not an ideal approach to reducing GHG emissions. Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University, provides an excellent summary of the pitfalls and vulnerabilities of command-and-control climate regulations:

Greenhouse gas regulations may be vulnerable to legal attacks, state resistance, and administrative delays that will compromise their ability to produce rapid reductions in emissions… climate regulations will be particularly vulnerable insofar as they are not clearly authorized by legislation.

Additionally, regulations are costly and inefficient compared to other emissions policies, such as a carbon tax.

EPA’s perplexing and incomprehensive regulatory impact analysis

While the proposed repeal of the power plant regulations would save a significant amount of compliance and administrative costs, the Trump Administration does not provide any estimates of climate costs associated with the repeal of all GHG emissions regulations on U.S. power plants. The Trump EPA’s regulatory impact analysis is perplexing in some cases as detailed above. Specifically, in some areas, the estimates seem to be produced by simply reversing the signs of the estimates in Biden’s EPA analysis, rather than using comprehensive modeling of all relevant factors.

Dive Brief:

Meta announced a deal with geothermal energy producer XGS Energy Thursday that will provide the tech and social media giant with carbon-free power to support its New Mexico data center operations

In exchange, Meta will support XGS’s development of 150 megawatts of next-generation geothermal energy production capacity in the state, according to the June 12 release. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham reportedly said the new plant will result in a $1 billion private sector investment, in addition to creating 3,000 construction jobs and 100 plant operation jobs.

The deal adds to the growing corporate demand for geothermal energy, which provides carbon-free power generation without weather dependence. Meta previously signed its first geothermal agreement with Sage Geosystems last year for power generation east of the Rocky Mountains.

Dive Insight:

XGS’s new geothermal plant will be built in two phases and is unique, as the company uses proprietary geothermal power production technology that works with zero operational water use, according to the release. The project’s completion will include an initial smaller phase of construction and a later, larger phase, with both expected to be completed and operational by 2030, the companies said.

On its own, this XGS project is expected to increase the total geothermal production in New Mexico by “a factor of 10,” according to the release. Meta Global Head of Energy Urvi Parekh said the social media giant is “excited” to work with XGS “to unlock a new category of energy supply” for its New Mexico operations.

“Advances in AI require continued energy to support infrastructure development,” Parekh said in Thursday's release. “With next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS ready for scale, geothermal can be a major player in supporting the advancement of technologies like AI as well as domestic data center development.”

For Meta, it is the company’s second foray into the geothermal market, following the deal with Sage Geosystems announced August 2024. That agreement will also lead to the development of 150 MW of next-generation geothermal power for the social media and tech conglomerate’s data center needs due to the uptick of artificial intelligence adoption.

XGS CEO Josh Prueher said the company is “pleased to support Meta’s ambitious AI objectives and accelerate access to new round-the-clock power supplies,” and called New Mexico “a growing hub for data center development. XGS’s technology has the ability to decouple geothermal energy production from typical location restraints like the availability of water or permeable or porous rocks. The company is also coming off a $13 million funding round in March.

Lujan Grisham said in a press release that the collaboration between Meta and XGS will strengthen the state’s grid and position it as a “national leader in next-generation renewable energy.”

“We’ve worked hard to ensure New Mexico remains at the forefront of the energy transition, and geothermal energy represents a promising new frontier,” Lujan Grisham said.

Geothermal energy has increasingly become an option for corporate clean energy buyers, resulting in both startup funding and development deals for the industry.

In March, Mastercard announced it would use geothermal energy to replace its natural gas-powered hearing and cooling systems at its Purchase, New York headquarters. That heating and cooling system contributes to Mastercard’s headquarters consuming more natural gas than any of the global payments company’s other offices.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/O9k68t89mFXnBsQlnsFKl-Cz-52eCKi189u9B-kybjg/g:nowe:0:104/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy03MTM2MTAzOC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-13 14:00:34.232034

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

In January 2021, shortly after former President Joe Biden took office and before his administration implemented new regulations and tax credits to incentivize the production of EVs, GM announced its plans to transition to an all-electric vehicle lineup by 2035. However, on Tuesday, GM announced that it would invest $4 billion in the production of mostly gasoline-powered vehicles as it backs away from its earlier EV targets, according to E&E News.

Furthermore, to avoid the 25% tariffs on vehicle imports from Mexico imposed by the Trump administration, GM is moving production of around a half-million gasoline-powered vehicles from Mexico to the U.S., E&E News reported.

Sam Abuelsmaid, an auto analyst for a Detroit-area research firm, told E&E that the move means the company is “giving up any hope of achieving that [2035] goal.”

GM’s shift follows cooling consumer demand for electric cars, and diminishing federal support for green energy projects under the Trump administration. On Thursday, Trump signed three bills that block California’s ability to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 in the Golden State and numerous others, effectively wiping out a key pillar of the Democrats’ de facto national EV mandate.

“We still believe in an all-EV future,” GM stated when asked on Wednesday by E&E about the status of the 2035 goal. Notably, GM CEO Mary Barra has consistently claimed that EVs are the future of transportation, and said in May that “EVs are fundamentally better.”

Behind the scenes, however, GM was actively lobbying the federal government to overturn California’s EV mandate.

“We need your help!” GM said in a recent email blast to its white-collar employees, The Wall Street Journal reported. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

While GM continues to build EVs — such as the electric Chevrolet Silverado, Cadillac Escalades and GMC Sierra— at its Factory Zero in Detroit, E&E reports that the plant is operating far below capacity.

In May, GM said it would halt its plans to produce electric motors at its Towanda Production plant in Buffalo, New York, opting instead to invest $888 million in manufacturing V-8 engines. Additionally, in 2023, GM committed $579 million to renovate an engine manufacturing facility in Flint, Michigan.

The current version of the “one big, beautiful bill” to advance President Trump’s political agenda also includes repealing Biden-era EV tax credits and other green energy subsidies. Moreover, the administration has cut billions in grant funding and loans that were shelled out under the auspices of the Biden administration.

He added, ""With a record amount of clean energy capacity added last year, we’re creating jobs and supporting local communities – all while building a cleaner, more reliable power grid.""

The DCEP will be constructed on 9,500 acres of non-arable land in western Fresno County.

It will feature a 1,150-megawatt (MW) solar facility with approximately 3.1 million panels and up to 1,150 MW (4,600 megawatt-hours) of battery storage, capable of powering 850,000 homes for four hours.

The project is owned by IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power.

CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo emphasized the community benefits of the project, saying, ""Today’s clean energy projects must do more than just deliver megawatts. They should create value in the communities where they’re built.""

The DCEP will provide $2 million in community investments over the next decade, create more than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs, and generate an estimated $169 million in economic benefits over its 35-year lifespan.

CEC Chair David Hochschild noted the importance of such projects for California's clean energy future, stating, ""The transition to 100 percent clean electricity by 2045 requires bold, utility-scale projects like Darden.""

He added, ""This project is significant not only for its size but its cutting-edge design and safety measures.""

As California continues to expand its battery storage capacity, safety remains a priority. Governor Newsom initiated a state-level collaborative in 2024 to enhance safety standards for battery storage systems, including updates to the California Fire Code and new safety standards approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.

California leads the U.S. in battery storage capacity, with over 200 utility-scale systems and more than 250,000 commercial and residential installations, totaling over 15,700 megawatts statewide.

Amudalat Ajasa reports for The Washington Post.

In short:

The EPA moved the reporting deadline for unpublished health and safety data on 16 chemicals from March 2025 to May 2026, citing the need to address industry concerns and finalize agency guidance.

The chemicals in question — including benzene, BPA, and vinyl chloride — are used in products ranging from plastics and tires to gasoline and adhesives, and are linked to cancer and developmental harm.

Environmental advocates argue the delay undermines chemical safety evaluations and public health protections by allowing companies to postpone disclosure of crucial risk data.

Key quote:

""This extension invites industry to withhold existing studies from federal regulators and makes it harder for EPA scientists to protect children, workers, and fenceline community residents from highly toxic substances.”

— Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, senior attorney at Earthjustice

Why this matters:

Many of the chemicals in question are embedded in daily life — found in plastics, gasoline, paints, and even rubber tires. Some are well-established carcinogens or endocrine disruptors. The delay in reporting health data could slow federal efforts to evaluate risks, regulate exposure, or warn the public. Communities living near industrial facilities are especially vulnerable to ongoing exposure. Without timely information, regulators can't act quickly to mitigate harm or enforce protections under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The extension signals a broader regulatory shift, raising concern among scientists and health advocates that industry interests will increasingly be prioritized over public health in chemical oversight.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60921434/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:02:54.711949

As we’ve pointed out repeatedly, clean energy and electric vehicle production tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed by Democrats disproportionately benefit states and districts controlled by Republican Congressmen. It really doesn’t make sense to kill policies that are supporting tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs, that seed the ground for success in the economic powerhouse industries of the future, and that return much more in financial benefit than they cost. But, of course, Republicans in Congress have to toe the party line like sheep and especially have to do the bidding of the oil & gas industry.

Before the so called “Big Beautiful Bill” was passed by the House of Representatives, 21 House Republicans wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson urging him to not cut clean energy tax incentives. Nonetheless, when it came time to vote for the bill and the cuts to the tax credits were still in there, these Republicans showed how useless they were and voted for the bill.

Now, incidentally, 13 of them in vulnerable districts are trying to get Republican Senators to step up and protect the incentives.

“Led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), the lawmakers said they remain ‘deeply concerned by several provisions’ that would aggressively phase down incentives from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law and add strict new supply chain requirements. Such steps could jeopardize billions of dollars in investments and thousands of jobs, companies and trade groups have said,” Politico reports.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, the House Republican lawmakers wrote: “We believe the Senate now has a critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers.”

Ah, yes, common sense — too bad they couldn’t deploy that when letting the bill get through the House!

Notably, tax credits were cut for renewables but were not cut for nuclear power or biofuels.

The lawsuit comes one day after the Trump administration proposed to repeal the 2024 MATS, and the 111 Power Plant rule limiting pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants that exacerbate climate-heating greenhouse air pollution.
His proclamation vaguely cited “national security” and “lack of available technology,” even though many coal plants already meet the MATS and proven pollution controls are widely available.
Background on MATS Before MATS was established in 2012, there were no federal limits on how much mercury and toxic air pollution coal power plants could emit.
In 2024, the EPA strengthened MATS, building on what has become one of its most effective air pollution rules.","— Today, community and environmental groups represented by Earthjustice sued the Trump administration over its unlawful decision to exempt dozens of coal-fired power plants from stronger pollution limits set in the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS. The exemptions, issued in April, allow 68 coal power plants to release more mercury, arsenic, and other heavy metals known to damage children’s brain development, trigger asthma attacks, and cause cancer.

The lawsuit comes one day after the Trump administration proposed to repeal the 2024 MATS, and the 111 Power Plant rule limiting pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants that exacerbate climate-heating greenhouse air pollution.

“This is a political favor for coal corporations that results in families and children breathing more mercury and arsenic, chemicals that cause cancers and birth defects,” said Earthjustice attorney Nicholas Morales. “Trump and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Zeldin claim they care about cleaning our air, our water, even our food, and yet their actions consistently tell a different story.”

In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin invited corporations to email the agency to request exemptions from clean air standards. Corporations were told they could cite “national security” or “lack of available technology” as justifications. A month later, two-year exemptions were sent to coal-fired power plants, although many already comply, and pollution controls are installed at most of the plants and are otherwise widely available.

The coal power plants granted exemptions are spread across 23 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Many of the exempted facilities are located in or near working-class communities and communities of color already burdened by pollution.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenges President Trump’s April 2025 proclamation granting pollution exemptions that had been requested by email, sidestepping any form of public process, and contravening the statutory framework. Trump’s power grab hinges on twisting Section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, a provision never used in 55 years and meant for true national security emergencies where pollution controls are unavailable. His proclamation vaguely cited “national security” and “lack of available technology,” even though many coal plants already meet the MATS and proven pollution controls are widely available.

The plaintiffs to the lawsuit are Air Alliance Houston, Clean Air Council, Downwinders at Risk, Montana Environmental Information Center, and Sierra Club, represented by Earthjustice; Center for Biological Diversity; Environmental Defense Fund, represented by Donahue, Goldberg & Herzog; Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, represented by Clean Air Task Force; Environmental Integrity Project; Dakota Resource Council and Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC), represented by ELPC; and NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council).

Background on MATS

Before MATS was established in 2012, there were no federal limits on how much mercury and toxic air pollution coal power plants could emit. The standards led to an 90% reduction in mercury emissions, 80% drop in other metals, and helped save up to 11,000 lives each year. In 2024, the EPA strengthened MATS, building on what has become one of its most effective air pollution rules.

EPA’s own analysis of the 2024 rule found:

$33 million in annual health benefits

Minimal impact on electricity reliability, with no expected retirements

Only 33 plants required upgrades to meet non-mercury metal standards.

Quotes from our clients

“The Trump administration is exempting the dirtiest plants in our country from a simple requirement to reduce their toxic pollution to match the vast majority of other plants, in most cases simply by repairing and using controls that are already in place,” said Sanjay Narayan, Sierra Club Chief Appellate Counsel. “That betrays the communities surrounding those plants, and has no basis in the law or common sense.”

“The Houston area already has some of the worst air pollution in the nation, and now the EPA is giving some of those worst polluters — coal plants — a free pass to pollute health-harming air toxics like mercury and arsenic right into our backyards,” said Jennifer Hadayia, executive director of Air Alliance Houston. “There is no excuse to let families and children breathe cancer-causing chemicals, so that W. A. Parish and coal-fired power plants like it can maintain their status quo.”

“This advances Trump’s polluters-first agenda and exposes families to continued injury from mercury, arsenic, and other toxic chemicals known to cause cancer, developmental damage, and respiratory illness. The law is clear in allowing exemptions only when a technology is unavailable. Forcing frontline communities most burdened by hazardous coal emissions to continue to suffer when the technology is proven and available is both illegal and unconscionable.” said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council.

“There are 170 coal-fired power plants in the country that use the same technology as the Colstrip plant in Montana, and every one of them has installed updated pollution control technology to protect communities from air toxics,” said Anne Hedges, executive director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “Harming human health to eke out a bit more shareholder profit from a coal plant — especially one that is the nation’s dirtiest for toxic emissions and is frequently broken when we need it most — is misguided, harmful, and expensive. Perhaps the billionaires in charge don’t care about human health or their electricity bills, but everyday Montanans sure do.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 13:03:03.966093

The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
JetZero has said it's already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

""North Carolina was first in flight.","JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro's airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing - also known as all-wing or blended-wing - Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it's already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

""North Carolina is the perfect location,"" Stein said. ""North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.""

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

Advt

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee - more than $1 billion over 37 years - is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers' paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

""We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,"" CEO Tom O'Leary said. ""So this is more than just a factory. It's a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.""

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane's shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

""It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you've ever had before on any other plane,"" O'Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.

NEW YORK -The Trump administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

The move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports, was welcomed by the biofuels industry, which had been lobbying on the issue for months.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed on Friday total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027. That compares with blending requirements of 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the nation's fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 - a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

The oil and biofuel industries, both major lobbying powers in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration's support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move earlier this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA's previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Oregon is among the states suing to block Trump’s action and preserve California’s authority to set emissions standards. “These clean air standards aren’t just about cars – they’re about protecting Oregonians’ health, our environment and our future,” Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “Oregon adopted these rules because we’re already seeing the impacts of air pollution and climate change in our communities, from worsening wildfires to rising asthma rates in kids.”

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you’re going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/trump-and-lawmakers-1536x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:05:52.456399

The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects.
While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.
The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source.
“We need to do very, very detailed mapping of the New Mexico subsurface and we need to do it quickly,” she said.","Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday announced what she described as a “big damn deal” for green energy production in New Mexico, one that she said will provide Meta’s New Mexico data centers with huge amounts of green energy they need without using much water or costing taxpayers a dime.

At a news conference at the Roundhouse, surrounded by cabinet agency heads and leaders from the Silicon Valley giant and also XGS Energy, the governor said the deal means XGS Energy would produce 150 megawatts of energy for Meta through its “advanced geothermal technology.”

Geothermal energy taps into heat under the Earth’s surface to generate electricity using steam turbines or further uses for heating and cooling. Leaders touted the “advanced” version of that technology as a way to minimize water usage through a “closed-loop” system and also by using a tiny surface footprint, claiming only 15 acres is needed on the surface for a project that produces enough energy to power 50,000 homes.

In addition to the energy production, the new geothermal plant will mean a $1 billion private sector investment that will create 3,000 construction jobs and 100 “really good” jobs running the geothermal power plant, the governor said.

It’s not clear when the company will break ground on the plant or plants or where they will be located. Company leaders described at least a three-year permitting timeline.

The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects. A 238-page academic report released Thursday claims the state has enough capacity to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power, which the report authors say is more than 15 times the amount of capacity the state had in 2023.

Combine the right geology with what Prueher called an easy permitting process, and then add in an oil and gas workforce that could be trained to work in geothermal technology, and you’ve got an environment that’s “easy and inviting for developers and investors” he said.

The governor said the state helped the deal come together through years of policy and legislative work, but stressed that no taxpayer money would be spent on it. She also said there isn’t any state agency rulemaking required or legislation that will need to pass at the upcoming legislative session.

“This is born from all the groundwork all of us have been laying in the state, which is why, frankly, it’s a great announcement jointly, and it should be a bit of a celebration,” she said.

The governor’s proposal is the latest she’s offered that seeks to enable continued growth while confronting the state’s arid climate, diminishing water supply and reliance on the oil and gas industry. In 2024, she announced a push for a so-called Strategic Water Supply that sought to create a market for wastewater produced by oil and gas drilling, along with brackish water.

The state’s 50-year water plan released last year says the state can expect a 25% reduction in its water supply over the next 50 years, thanks to climate change-caused aridification.

While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.

In a presentation elsewhere in Santa Fe as part of the release of the academic report, Melanie Kenderdine, secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, showed a map that suggested the sites could be in Sandoval, San Miguel, Doña Ana, Catron and Hidalgo counties, and listed an additional 13 other counties that have “most favorable potential for other sites.”

The state aims to move forward with further projects, Kenderdine told attendees at a conference hosted by Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit pushing for further geothermal projects.

The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source.

On Thursday, legislative committees in the Assembly and Senate approved measures related to state energy policies and the overall affordability of energy in New Jersey.

These included a bipartisan measure that cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee to establish a nuclear power advisory commission in New Jersey.

“As demand grows, the state must undertake a serious, science-based evaluation of how nuclear energy can help meet our clean energy goals,” said Sen. Joseph Pennacchio (R-Morris).

Bid to reject electricity auction results

In a different Senate committee, lawmakers approved a resolution urging federal regulators to formally reject the results of a regional electricity pricing auction that has resulted in skyrocketing utility bills for consumers in New Jersey taking effect this month.

“New Jersey families and businesses are now facing higher electric bills because of a capacity auction process that appears rigged against the public interest,” said Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson).

Last week, Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders announced a plan to use more than $400 million to help offset the electricity bill increases, which are estimated to run as high as 20% for some consumers.

Their action comes as many lawmakers are gearing up for a November election where all 80 seats in the Assembly are on the ballot.

‘Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey.’ — Jasmine Metellus, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters

However, compounding concerns about the state’s rising energy bills — and any political implications — is federal legislation that calls for ending federal tax credits for renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen production and nuclear energy among other policy changes.

By some estimates, these federal changes alone could push electricity costs up by nearly 10% by 2030.

Community solar program

At the state level, a bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) calls for revising New Jersey’s community solar energy program, including by updating development targets and eliminating capacity caps.

“The growth that is projected here is exactly the growth that we need,” said Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, while testifying in favor of the legislation moments before it was cleared by members of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

The same bill was also up for consideration in the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee, where it drew praise from Jasmine Metellus from the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

“Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey,” Metellus said.

Concerns about data centers

Meanwhile, the same committee took up a measure that calls for establishing regulations and rates that would be levied on “large load” data centers, defined as consuming 100 megawatts or more of electricity.

As the industrial footprint of data centers expands nationally, including to support artificial intelligence businesses, many states are grappling with how to regulate their huge energy demands in ways that also protect residential consumers.

“If we, in New Jersey, are not proactive in creating a plan, and these guardrails, for addressing the problems that data centers can pose to maintaining an affordable and reliable grid, everyday taxpayers and small businesses will pay the price,” said Assemblyman Dave Bailey (D-Salem).

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030.

The measure received some opposition before the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee ultimately approved it.

Data centers are “the future of economic growth, here in our state, and across the country,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association economic policy research analyst Jack Ramirez told committee members.

He pointed to economic development related to data centers in places like Pennsylvania and Virginia that share the regional energy grid with New Jersey.

Ramirez also warned that higher utility rates for data centers currently up for consideration in New Jersey could “turn away these centers from our state to states with more competitive and better (business) environments.”

Salvation in the ocean?

The same committee also cleared bipartisan legislation calling for additional study by the state Board of Public Utilities of the potential of ocean wave and tidal energy.

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030. The bill, sponsored by Guardian, calls for making New Jersey a “nationwide leader in ocean energy.”

“It’s really an exciting proposition and absolutely worth exploring,” Guardian said.

Among other energy-related legislation advancing on Thursday were those seeking to:

Require electric public utilities to file an annual report with the BPU on recorded votes at meetings of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator serving more than 65 million consumers, across 13 states, including New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.

Require a public utility to annually review its actual revenues collected during the year and its total revenue requirement to determine if it collected excess profits during that year. After any year in which a public utility collected excess profits, the utility would be required to redistribute its excess profits to customers, in a proportional manner and in intervals prescribed by BPU, through a refund mechanism subject to board approval.

Update consumer notification requirements under New Jersey’s “Energy Bill Watch” program.

Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said.","With much fanfare, EMPOWERment Inc., held a ribbon-cutting in April for P.E.A.C.H Apartments, a 10-unit affordable housing complex it developed for low-income residents unable to pay Chapel Hill’s high rents.

At the ribbon cutting, U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-NC) and other dignitaries praised the nonprofit for its vision and persistence in addressing a critical need for safe and affordable housing in the town that is home to UNC Chapel Hill, the flagship university of the state’s 17-campus UNC System.

Families were supposed to begin moving into apartments for tenants earning at or below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI) the following month but it never happened. The anticipated move-ins were short circuited because Duke Energy Progress refused to run power to the apartments, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint EMPOWERment Inc., filed against the energy company with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

“We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment INC. “Our building is at risk and 10 families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 30% AMI for the Durham-Chapel Hill HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area is $22,250 for a family of one, $25,400 for a family of two, $28,600 for a family of three and $31,750 for a family of four.

Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels installed to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments. The nonprofit’s contractors submitted plans for the single meter in July 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October 2024, Bailey said, but the power company didn’t notify the nonprofit that it wouldn’t provide service until February 2025.

The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.

“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”

EMPOWERment Inc., asked the state Utilities Commission for the following relief:

Require Duke connect electric service to EMPOWERment’s PEACH Apartments immediately, while the Commission considers this Emergency Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling, to prevent the risk of irreparable harm and health risks from the lack of essential electric service.

Order that Duke permit the use of “master” meters when the lease between landlord and tenant states that the cost of electric and/or gas utilities is included in rental payments, as set forth in G. S. § 143-151. 42(b)(2).

In the alternative, declare that a multifamily residential building is eligible to use a single “master” meter, with the Commission’s approval, when served by a solar array.

Require Duke to provide permanent electric service to the PEACH Apartments under the current single-meter configuration.

At issue in the disagreement is state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.

Bailey told NC Newsline that the energy utility would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.

To rewire the units so that each has a meter would cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said.

“We don’t have that,” she said. “We don’t have that laying around somewhere.”

Bailey said it would take to three to six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route.

“My apartments are 85% done,” Bailey said. “I can’t have them sitting around for six months without an air conditioning to control the humidity in North Carolina. When it rains like it does and it gets hot like it does, I’m inviting mold issues.”

Duke Energy said it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide this statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks: “Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”

The nonprofit was unable to convince Duke Energy to allow the single meter to be used temporarily so families could move in while parts to rewire the building were ordered, Bailey said.

Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said. Target tenants earn between $11 and $16 an hour, Bailey said, and have been anxiously awaiting news about when they can move into the new apartments.

“EMPOWERment Inc., is a small nonprofit trying to do the right thing for all the right reasons,” Bailey said. “Thirty-percent and below [AMI] income are people like your grocery store baggers or your assistant teacher or the people who take your tickets at the movie theater — that’s who we’re working for.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PEACHdrawing-2048x1152.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 13:04:30.243286

Atalco’s facility in St. James Parish, the last remaining alumina producer in the United States, is facing mounting pressure from Chinese product dumping and environmental activist criticism, as state and industry leaders rally in support of its economic and national defense contributions.

The Gramercy plant supplies alumina, a critical input for aluminum used in aerospace, military, and manufacturing applications. Industry leaders say China’s state-backed overproduction has created artificially low global prices, posing a threat to U.S. supply chain security.

“This is a tactic we see repeated against American manufacturers,” said David Cresson, CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association. “If successful, it could irreparably disrupt the security of supply chains that keep American industry running.”

Gov. Jeff Landry called the issue one of national survival. “We’re not handing our future to foreign adversaries,” he said, citing Louisiana’s role in safeguarding vital domestic industries.

Atalco supports over 550 jobs, 70 percent of which are unionized, and half of which are held by individuals from minority communities. Despite this, the company has drawn criticism from environmental groups, which company officials say distorts regulatory progress and threatens local livelihoods.

“These are our neighbors—raising families here, supporting small businesses, contributing to our schools, and helping fund local infrastructure through millions in local and state tax revenue”, said Ray Gregson, CEO of the River Region Chamber of Commerce. “The work they do isn’t just important—it’s essential to the nation’s defense systems, aerospace, and the supply chain. The impact of Atalco in the River Parishes is real, direct, and irreplaceable.”

The company has invested over $30 million in new residue filtering technology that cuts waste by 35% and moves the site away from wet waste storage. Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois called it a “global first” and praised Atalco’s environmental progress.

Atalco has also invested more than $10 million in dust collection systems and is collaborating with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to enhance compliance.

The Gramercy site produces up to 1.2 million metric tons of alumina annually. Advocates warn that its closure could create dangerous foreign dependence.

Shelley Robbins

Despite massive uncertainty across the economy, Duke Energy is plowing ahead with its plan to build new fossil gas-fired power plants to serve data center, manufacturing, and other large customer load that may not even show up. Duke has asked the NC Utilities Commission for permission to build a combined-cycle (CC) gas plant in Person County, North Carolina, at the site of Duke’s Roxboro coal plant.

SACE has argued against the need for this gas power plant in the Certificate of Public Need and Necessity (CPCN) docket, submitting testimony to the Commission on Monday, June 9, 2025. Here’s a summary of that testimony (prepared by Synapse Energy Economics, Inc.), which explains what this all means for Duke’s billpayers, and how Duke can make changes within its control to protect customers and reduce pollution. These recommendations include:

Not approving this new gas power plant because the risks that it will increase bills are too high. Instead, Duke should improve the processes that are holding back lower-cost renewables and storage, then use renewables and storage to meet new load.

Instead of approving this specific gas plant, the Commission should order Duke to use an all-source procurement process to determine a portfolio of flexible assets that can meet the utility’s needs based on real-world costs.

In the event the Commission approves this gas plant, it should protect customers from high bills due to volatile gas prices by instituting a fuel cost sharing mechanism for the fuel costs spent to run this plant.

Duke Doesn’t Need this Risky Gas Power Plant

Duke’s claim that it needs this fossil gas power plant is based on outdated analysis. In this CPCN docket, Duke relies on its 2023 Carbon Plan Integrated Resource Plan (CPIRP) modeling and the CPIRP supplemental update and analysis filed in January 2024. The world has changed dramatically since then, and it is important that the Commission review the latest information before approving expenditures that will impact customer bills for decades.

Duke’s load forecast – once based on steady, predictable growth – is now subject to significant uncertainty as 1) data center developers look around the country for the best deal and the fastest interconnection to the grid and 2) manufacturers announce projects and then pull back as political uncertainty changes the economics of those projects. Under Duke’s current rate structure, prospective companies and site developers do not need to commit much money to become part of Duke’s load forecast. They have very little “skin in the game,” and Duke currently does not have policies in place to change this. If the Commission allows Duke to build an expensive fossil gas plant for load that doesn’t materialize, Duke’s remaining customers will be on the hook to pay for it.

Duke’s own load forecast updates since 2023 show that there are wild swings in its predictions. In the Spring of 2023, Duke anticipated 8 new large load projects during its 10-year planning forecast period, requiring an average of 169 MW each. Then for Fall 2023 (the supplemental update filed in January 2024), Duke anticipated 35 projects requiring an average of 111 MW each. In Summer 2024, Duke changed its forecast again, projecting 39 projects requiring an average of only 103 MW. And in May 2025, Duke filed an update showing a reduction in the number of projects back down to 35 but a dramatic increase in average need – back up to 169 MW. Duke’s forecasts will continue to show swings up and down – both in the number of projects and megawatts – until Duke has policies in place that require more commitment from the companies that knock on its door requesting service. Duke also has not published information regarding the location of these loads – the latest forecast applies to all of Duke Energy in both North and South Carolina.

It is also important to know that that this gas plant isn’t needed to meet growing load from existing customers or to replace retiring coal plants (according to Duke’s own testimony). This gas plant is being justified by new manufacturing and data centers claiming they will be operating somewhere in Duke Energy Progress or Duke Energy Carolinas territory in North or South Carolina.

Even if the load shows up, this plant won’t be needed for long

Even Duke admits that it doesn’t “need” this fossil gas power plant for very long. These kinds of power plants, combined-cycle plants, are typically used about 80% of the time, i.e. they are “baseload” power plants. But even absent federal carbon regulations, Duke expects this power plant’s usage to decline significantly throughout its 35-year lifetime (from 80% in 2030 decreasing to 46% by 2040 and only 13% by 2050 onwards). As cheaper renewables and storage with zero fuel costs are brought online, they will displace this plant. Duke is proposing to build a giant power plant that will very quickly run less and less – but Duke’s customers will continue to pay for it until 2065—15 years past a state law requiring Duke’s generation fleet to be carbon neutral. This represents a significant change in how power plants are built and run, and this is not in the best interest of Duke’s billpayers. To add insult to injury, Duke hasn’t even procured all of the equipment needed to build this plant, so the costs could skyrocket even more than they already have since last year’s carbon plan proceeding.

Renewables are flexible, would protect customers, and would reduce pollution

Duke’s model only chose a gas plant to meet this capacity need because of limits Duke imposed on the model. Duke claims it cannot interconnect renewables and storage fast enough to meet this capacity need, but the reasons it cannot interconnect those resources faster are all within Duke’s control. As Synapse recommends, Duke needs to update its processes that are holding back renewables and storage from serving customers with low-cost and low-risk resources. These processes include interconnection and transmission planning.

SACE has been advocating for improvements to these processes for years, and Duke has made changes to both its interconnection process and transmission planning. Duke was one of the first utilities in the Southeast to implement cluster studies in its interconnection process, and it is in the midst of the first scenario-based transmission planning exercise in the region. But is there evidence that these updates have helped if Duke continues to limit solar and storage in its future resource modeling? Given the much quicker interconnection process recently demonstrated in Texas, this raises the question of how hard Duke is really trying to streamline renewables interconnection.

Modular, flexible resources such as wind, solar, and energy storage can be adjusted in quantity based on market conditions. As our testimony from Synapse states, “This modularity, combined with the fact that solar and wind have zero exposure to fuel price volatility once they are constructed, makes these resources particularly valuable in the face of trade tariff uncertainty.”

The bottom line is that the Commission needs a lot more certainty about load growth and costs before committing Duke’s billpayers to any type of large fossil gas power plant.

Meanwhile, similar initiatives in steel and aluminum continue to move forward with federal backing—an imbalance that is raising concerns about the consistency of industrial policy during the U.S. decarbonization push.

GPI leaders argue that their industry’s proposals were well-aligned with federal climate goals and based on proven, energy-efficient technologies. Yet DOE officials cited compliance issues and questioned whether the glass sector projects reflected current program priorities.

The industry contends these rejections were based on narrow interpretations and inconsistent criteria. According to GPI, the proposed projects would have delivered measurable emissions reductions and enhanced energy performance across glass manufacturing operations.

DOE’s uneven approach, industry stakeholders say, risks undermining the administration’s public commitments to supporting a broad cross-section of American manufacturing. The decision also threatens progress toward emissions targets within an important—but often overlooked—industrial sector.

Glass Sector Seeks Fairer Approach to Industrial Policy

Glass manufacturing in the U.S. is deeply integrated into critical supply chains, supporting industries ranging from food and beverage to pharmaceuticals. With production and recycling operations fully contained within U.S. borders, the sector supports more than 13,000 American jobs. Many facilities have been operating for generations, embedding the sector within longstanding regional economies.

At the same time, the industry faces mounting competition from lower-cost imports, particularly from China. Despite these challenges, domestic glass manufacturers have made ongoing investments in modernization and sustainable production. Maintaining competitiveness while meeting stricter North American labor and environmental standards remains an ongoing priority for the sector.

GPI President Scott DeFife underscores that glass manufacturing supports a unionized, skilled workforce and delivers fully recyclable, safe packaging that aligns with long-term sustainability goals. The organization is now urging the DOE to engage directly with glass sector leaders to ensure future funding processes reflect the full diversity of the U.S. industrial base.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250611-103054-301-francesco-bovolin-cZvhbvYZ1Tk-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:06:03.296629

Then, drought, catastrophic wildfires, and winds causing power outages began to impact several communities in Northern New Mexico.

That is when Luis Reyes, CEO of Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, began searching for a solution to enhance the city’s energy portfolio and bring new jobs to the area. He landed on something called hydrogen microgrids.

Questa received a grant to study the viability of the project and after 18 months, the National Renewable Energy Lab in Boulder, Colorado returned its conclusion. The proposed project came back as viable.

“The technology is proven. Hydrogen has been around on the private side for a while now. We are just taking that technology and using it for a long duration battery and using it to create electricity for rural areas that are isolated,” Reyes said.

Microgrids are localized energy systems that use various power sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen. Kit Carson Electric Cooperative plans to use the hydrogen fuel cells to power small communities, businesses and critical public services.

“We can create a microgrid where we can serve parts of our system while the other parts may be out of power. There will still be parts of the system that keep critical infrastructure operating for the public safety,” said Reyes.

Microgrids can offer resilience, sustainability and a cost effective source of clean energy. “The members of the coop agree for all these reasons, hydro microgrids are worth it for their community. ""

“If you create the hydrogen through an electrolyzer, it’s clean. And, run it through a fuel cell, it’s clean. It’s clean energy, which our community wants,” Reyes continued. “And it would create jobs, both in construction and operations.”

Safety and engineering studies are now underway. The project is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028. Construction will employ between 1300 and 1500 workers and long-term operations of the microgrids requires 30 full-time employees.

“One of the things I’m looking at is helping local citizens get new skill sets, so these skills are transferable to other towns and cities,” Reyes said. “Then, you kind of take what you learned here and get jobs at other energy projects in the region.”

Reyes admits there are challenges. These challenges include escalating costs for materials, supply chain issues, identifying and preparing for safety issues, and acquiring the highest capacity storage batteries.

The American Public Power Association reports other challenges such as regulatory hurdles and implementing and maintaining technical integrations between multiple systems.

The Kit Carson Electric Coop sells most of its electricity during the winter months and lower during the summer. By using fossil fuels, solar and hydrogen, the coop can select the best energy source for the need, and assure availability in an emergency.

Cities in Colorado and Utah are also developing microgrids while Idaho Falls, Idaho successfully uses hydro power to support customers during critical outages.

The press release states:

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential…

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign-made energy.

In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix. The Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan.

The Clean Power Plan 2.0 would have devastated grid reliability across MISO and other regional grids due to coal-fired generator shutdowns. American Experiment submitted a 35-page comment on the Biden administration’s original draft of the rule in 2023, which would have also required existing natural gas plants to capture emissions as well.

American Experiment’s reliability analysis showed that the EPA’s modeled MISO grid would “result in large capacity shortfalls that will cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars” and that shoring up those shortfalls would cost an additional $246 billion. Those costs would have outweighed the estimated net benefits that the EPA found for the entire country.

The EPA estimates its proposal to repeal power plant emissions rules would save $19 billion over 20 years in compliance costs. However, to avert blackouts and maintain reliability, hundreds of billions of dollars would have been spent replacing retiring coal plants with intermittent wind and solar.

On Wednesday, the U.S. EPA proposed repealing Biden administration rules that limit toxic pollutants and planet-warming emissions from coal and gas plants across the country. These plants ​“do not contribute significantly” to ​“dangerous” air pollution, the EPA claimed — something that many, many studies have shown isn’t true. Power plants are the second-largest source of carbon emissions in the country, and they’re responsible for a lot of health-harming pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, too.

When the Biden administration first announced the rules last year, the EPA estimated they would stem 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047. That’s the equivalent of taking 328 million gas cars off the road for a year, and amounts to an estimated $370 billion in climate and public health benefits.

Those benefits would’ve helped communities surrounding gas and coal plants around the U.S., according to the Sierra Club’s Trump Coal Pollution Dashboard. For example, Montana’s Colstrip 3 plant would have to reduce its toxic pollution under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, while a slew of plants across the Midwest and Southwest would have to install carbon-capture systems or shut down under the greenhouse gas rules.

The changes will allow coal plants around the country to keep burning. In North Dakota, some state officials are celebrating what they say is a big step toward protecting jobs and the coal industry. But in Georgia, health advocates and scientists warn the preservation of coal plants in their state will fall hard on vulnerable communities, especially those surrounding the facilities.

Still, none of this is set in stone. The EPA’s proposals are vulnerable to several legal pitfalls, including challenges involving the Clean Air Act, the agency’s insistence that power plants don’t produce ​“significant” emissions, and the health, economic, and other costs of increasing pollution, E&E News reports. Analysts with TD Cowen expect the EPA to finalize the rules by early next year, but say legal challenges and uncertainty will continue through all of 2026.

More big energy stories

“Big, Beautiful Bill” threatens rooftop solar

President Donald Trump’s ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” is already having big impacts on the rooftop solar industry. The bill, now undergoing negotiations in the Senate, looks to repeal tax credits for solar installations and other clean energy projects. That includes credits that allowed a North Carolina food bank to install solar panels on the roof of its headquarters, which it anticipates will save the organization $143,000 each year. Other nonprofits are looking to follow suit — but they probably won’t be able to if they can’t access federal incentives, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reports.

The bill is also causing problems for two solar companies. Lender Solar Mosaic filed for bankruptcy last week, specifically citing ​“legislation that threatens to eliminate tax credits for residential solar” as a forthcoming challenge. Residential solar giant Sunnova followed with a bankruptcy filing over the weekend.

While both companies’ difficulties predate the Trump administration, it’s clear that the residential solar sector is facing a difficult and uncertain moment, one analyst told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John. An analysis by Ohm Analytics estimates that the House’s version of the bill would lead rooftop solar installations across the country to drop by half next year, and another from Morgan Stanley projects an 85% decrease through 2030.

Bright spots for clean energy

Amid a sea of bad news for clean energy companies, some are still finding success.

Take Sublime Systems, which recently had its $87 million federal grant cancelled: Sublime says private-sector support is allowing its $150 million low-carbon cement factory in Massachusetts to move forward anyway.

Solar panel manufacturer Qcells said it’s launching a new recycling operation in Georgia to repurpose retired panels. Heirloom Carbon is meanwhile keeping its operations rolling by winning over Republican state leadership in Louisiana, where it aims to build a facility that extracts carbon dioxide from the air. Developer Intersect Power got the green light Wednesday to build what would be the biggest solar-and-storage plant in the nation.

And in the Chicago area, Sun Metalon just raised $9.1 million from investors — including Japan’s Nippon Steel — to build its steel decarbonization business, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. The startup has created an oven-sized box that melts down waste metal and sludge from steel and aluminum production, churning out pucks of reusable, recyclable metal.

Dive Brief:

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesdayproposed eliminating greenhouse gas emissions standards and loosening mercury emissions requirements at power plants nationwide.

EPA estimates repealing emission guidelines and carbon capture requirementswould save the power sector about $1.2 billion a year beginning in 2026 and repealing 2024 amendments to mercury emissions standardswould save power plants about $120 million a year.

Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors, responded to the proposed changes. “These rollbacks undermine the ability of mayors to shield their residents from harm and would allow corporations to pollute our air and water, and erode the quality of life for children and families across America,” Climate Mayors Executive Director Kate Wright said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March the agency was reconsidering certain power plant emissions regulations, known as Clean Power Plan 2.0, imposed by the Biden administration in May 2024.

When the rules were announced in 2024,the EPA estimated they would prevent up to 1,200 premature deaths, 360,000 asthma symptoms and 57,000 lost workdays in 2035.

The EPA’s announcement this week states it is moving forward to repeal the 2024 regulations, which it says “have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity.”

TheU.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that repealing Clean Power Plan 2.0 “would remove a barrier to producing the electricity generation needed to maintain our domestic energy security and our competitive edge in critical fields like artificial intelligence.”

Some community leaders pushed back, saying the repeal would harm their constituents’ health.

“With so many affordable, zero-emission energy sources on the market, it is beyond unacceptable that the EPA would roll back pollution rules for power plants,” Ashley Stolzmann, a county commissioner in Boulder County, Colorado, said in an emailed statement. “In our area, we need to reduce power plant emissions, reverse the damage and clean our air.”

Climate Mayors said weakening safeguards around mercury “not only jeopardizes the health of city residents, especially those in historically underserved neighborhoods, it also hinders the ability of local leaders to build stronger, healthier and more resilient communities.”

The National League of Cities, in an emailed statement, urged the EPA “to consider the perspective of local leaders from America’s cities, towns and villages.”

“As first responders, local leaders across the nation have taken significant steps to mitigate impacts and strengthen their communities,” NLC stated. “Despite the progress local governments have made and their commitment to continuing action, it is clear our work is not done. We urge the federal government to be a partner in these efforts in support of the economy and building resilient communities.”

TheLeague of Conservation Voters vowed to “fight back against these unpopular, dangerous schemes,” and the National Resources Defense Council suggested it will sue. “Our lawyers will be watching closely, and if the EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court,” NRDC President and CEO Manish Bapna said in a statement.

Lawmakers responded along party lines.

U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, a Republican from Virginia,said it gives “communities like mine in Appalachia hope.” He said he would “continue to support federal developments that aim to reinvigorate coal communities and lower energy costs for American families.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GicBIvWxbb6sZRbjgg6a5I2o-Db_valfo3SkAKxbzms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5MTc0OTU3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:15.029437

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal.
“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth.
""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats.

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal. Nineteen of them responded, all saying that the proposal was scientifically wrong and many of them called it disinformation. Here's what eight of them said.

“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth. “The relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperatures has been well established since the late 1800s, and coal burning is the single biggest driver of global CO2 emissions, followed by oil and gas. It is utterly nonsensical to say that carbon emissions from power plants do not contribute significantly to climate change.”

""It’s about as valid as saying that arsenic is not a dangerous substance to consume,"" said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.

""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats. These are indisputable facts,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and a retired public health professor at the University of Washington.

Climate economist R. Daniel Bressler of Columbia University, said: “We can use tools from climate economics, including the mortality cost of carbon and the social cost of carbon, to estimate the climate impacts of these emissions. For instance, in my past work, I found that adding just one year’s worth of emissions from an average-sized coal-fired plant in the U.S. causes 904 expected temperature-related deaths and over $1 billion in total climate damages.”

University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs said: ""Their statement is in direct conflict with evidence that has been presented by thousands of scientists from almost 200 countries for decades.

“It’s basic chemistry that burning coal and natural gas releases carbon dioxide and it’s basic physics that CO2 warms the planet. We’ve known these simple facts since the mid-19th century,” said Oregon State's Phil Mote.

Andrew Weaver, a professor at the University of Victoria and former member of parliament in British Columbia, said: “President Trump is setting himself up for international court charges against him for crimes against humanity. To proclaim you don’t want to deal with climate change is one thing, but denying the basic science can only be taken as a wanton betrayal of future generations for which there should be consequences.”

Stanford climate scientist Chris Field, who coordinated an international report linking climate change to increasingly deadly extreme weather, summed it up this way: ""It is hard to imagine a decision dumber than putting the short-term interests of oil and gas companies ahead of the long-term interests of our children and grandchildren.""

City officials said the public chargers — located at stations at the Warren Hood Building parking lot on the corner of Pearl Street and State Street, as well as Thalia Mara Hall and Union Station — are free to use for now but didn’t know for how long that would stay the case.

As of 2023, Mississippi had the fewest number of electric vehicles on the road per capita, based on registration data from the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE numbers also show Mississippi has the second fewest public charging stations per capita after Louisiana.

In 2018, state lawmakers passed an annual fee of $150 for electric car owners and $75 for hybrid vehicles owners as a way of compensating for lost gas tax revenue.

Entergy bought the chargers from Tesla, and the nonprofit Adopt a Charger installed the units through local contractor Lavallee, which will also maintain them for the city. Jackson’s Planning and Development Director Jhai Keeton said the city is paying just $600 a year for the chargers.

Adopt a Charger partners with private companies, in this case Entergy, who want to sponsor charging stations for public use. The nonprofit, according to its website, has also partnered on stations at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and at Hinds Community College in Raymond.

While there were already several charging stations in Jackson, the ones unveiled Thursday are the first owned by the city. Prior to then, Tupelo had the most charging stations of any Mississippi city with 13, according to DOE data. Hattiesburg and Jackson, not including the new stations, each have 12, and there are 10 in both Biloxi and Gulfport.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation is using $50 million in federal funds to develop electric vehicle corridors with 30 new stations throughout the state, but those projects are likely one to two years away. ___

“It was a significant setback and it’s deeply disappointing,” said CleanAIRE NC spokesman Andrew Whelan, about the recent court decision on the appeal.
CleanAIRE NC used this funding for education efforts and to install sensors that collect data on pollutants impacting health.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs are appealing the decision after filing an “en banc” review, according to Gerald Babao, CleanAIRE NC deputy director.
“But it’s not going to stop the work.” CleanAIRE NC is planning to launch a fundraising campaign this month for air monitoring across the state.","A nonprofit’s plan to continue using EPA grants to monitor clean air across Mecklenburg County was derailed again after a federal appeals court upheld the Trump administration’s decision to slash funding for environmental programs.

In late May, a federal district court judge in South Carolina ordered funding to be restored for environmental programs across the country, including Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, according to Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.

A $500,000 Environmental Protection Agency grant from last year was restored to monitor air quality in four northern Mecklenburg communities: Smithville in Cornelius; Huntington Green and Pottstown in Huntersville; and West Davidson in Davidson. This work includes the installation of air monitors.

But that victory didn’t last long.

On June 5, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked a lower court order requiring federal organizations to restore grant funding to nonprofits and municipalities. Earlier this year, the Department of Government Efficiency and the Environmental Protection Agency had begun cutting hundreds of grants nationwide, totaling $1.7 billion, according to an EPA news release.

“It was a significant setback and it’s deeply disappointing,” said CleanAIRE NC spokesman Andrew Whelan, about the recent court decision on the appeal. “It means that we’re once again putting this critical work on hold, when we had just begun to reengage with the communities.”

CleanAIRE NC also installed air monitors in McCrorey Heights in 2024, using a $75,000 EPA grant awarded in 2021. This work included the installation of monitors in several Historic West End neighborhoods such as Washington Heights, Northwood Estates, Hoskins Road, and Oaklawn Park, as well as McCrorey Heights.

The latest grant for northern Mecklenburg County originated from the EPA’s Environmental Justice Collaborative, a Clinton-era initiative designed to address environmental challenges in minority and low-income populations. CleanAIRE NC used this funding for education efforts and to install sensors that collect data on pollutants impacting health.

About the fight over federal funds

Before the funding freeze, CleanAIRE NC had been testing equipment in north Mecklenburg County that was slated for installation.

The court’s recent decision stems from a lawsuit filed in March by the SELC and Public Rights Project against the funding freeze.

This lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Charleston on behalf of 13 nonprofits and six cities, highlighted how the pause furloughed employees and halted programs vital to communities, farmers and public health.

“This ruling echoes what cities and local governments have said all along: the unlawful termination of congressionally approved funds caused real harm to communities,” said Public Rights Project Founder and CEO Jill Habig in May.

The permanent injunction would have restored the majority of the grants that SELC and the PRP represented in the lawsuit, according to the organizations.

In May, SELC Litigation Director Kym Meyer said the organization is ready to challenge the administration’s decision, including taking the appeal up to the Supreme Court if needed.

Details of the case

On June 5, according to court documents, the Richmond, Va.-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the administration’s request for a stay because the government is likely to succeed in its argument that the district court lacked the authority to issue such an order.

The appeals court found that the dispute likely falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, rather than a district court.

Citing a Supreme Court decision, the Fourth Circuit stated that the payment of money under grant agreements are essentially contract disputes usually handled by the Court of Federal Claims.

“Residents were very excited about the process of finally getting answers about their local air quality,” Whelan said. “We were actively engaged in the process and to have it paused again, it’s a real punch to the gut.”

Government officials said disbursing those funds would cause irreparable harm, as they cannot recoup the money later.

Circuit Judge Toby Heytens filed a dissent in the case. He stated that the government did not make a “strong showing” that it would likely to succeed on the merits to warrant a stay.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs are appealing the decision after filing an “en banc” review, according to Gerald Babao, CleanAIRE NC deputy director. This means all judges of the court, instead of a panel, will review the case

In the meantime, the organization will continue to push for funding restoration and move forward with its work.

“We certainly will continue to diversify funding resources, whether that be applying for state grant funds, through private foundations and community donations,” Babao said. “But it’s not going to stop the work.”

CleanAIRE NC is planning to launch a fundraising campaign this month for air monitoring across the state. Last week, it launched an online dashboard to track real-time air quality in neighborhoods.

Whelan said north Mecklenburg residents have lived with the impacts of industrial pollution and heavy traffic for decades, without any kind of comprehensive studies about air quality.

“The aim of this project is to change that and give them the tools and knowledge to understand their environment and to help them advocate for healthier living,” he said. “The legal setback is frustrating, but it does not diminish the critical needs of this work.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/ajmjej/picture302755049/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CleanAIRE%20NC%20(4),N,,2025-06-13 12:05:43.816246

The data comes from Rho Motion, which said that the May sales figures also represented a more modest monthly increase of 8%.

Over the first five months of the year, global EV sales topped 7 million with China seeing sales of 4.4 million over the period. Chinese sales were supported by the authorities extending the vehicle trade-in policy scheme into 2025 to boost consumer consumption and spending and help economic growth.

“The story this month with global vehicle sales is the continued chasm between Chinese market growth which saw one million vehicles sold in May, versus the faltering market in N. America,” data manager Charles Lester said.

Lester added that EV and hybrid sales in Europe were “healthy”, noting the role that government support plays in the growth of EV adoption in the region.

The EV industry had a difficult year in 2024 as key governments tries to phase out subsidies and let sales be driven by the market. They soon found out this was not happening and reinstated the incentives to keep people buying electric vehicles, reversing the sales decline.

Challenges remain, however, as EV makers outside China still struggle to put their electric cars on an economic par with internal combustion engine vehicles despite progress in bringing down costs.

In the United States things are very different than they are in Europe, with the Trump administration axing incentives, leaving carmakers to fend for themselves. The first reactions are already in: GM said this week it will invest $4 billion in expanding its ICE car production in a departure from previously announced plans to go all-electric by 2035.

The Trump administration's proposal is a significant step up compared to the Biden administration's multi-year rule that set biomass-based diesel volumes at 3.35 billion gallons in 2025. The industry has been calling for much higher RFS volumes to match actual production, at a time when biodiesel plants have been cutting back or closing production in light of lingering tax uncertainty.

On small-refinery exemptions, the EPA offered an evaluation of where things stand.

EPA said the total volumes requirements remain the same regardless of SREs but the percentage obligations for non-exempt obligated parties increase when SREs are granted. So, the volume obligations would be achieved by fewer obligated parties.

""There is currently significant uncertainty regarding the number of small-refinery exemption petitions that could be granted for 2026 and 2027,"" the agency said in the proposal.

""We have yet to take further action on these petitions and are still determining how we will evaluate and decide those petitions, which would then inform how we would evaluate and decide any SRE petitions received for 2026 and 2027. We expect to communicate our policy regarding SRE petitions going forward before finalization of this rule.""

EPA provides a range of potential gallons exempted for 2026 and 2027 from what it says are about 34 qualifying and operational small refineries that produce about 18 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel. To qualify for exemptions, the RFS requires small refineries to show disproportionate harm from having to meet their obligations.

Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.

""It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,"" Cooper said in a statement.

""The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA's plans on SREs and today's proposal helps to clarify the agency's approach moving forward. We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump's first administration. However, EPA's top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.""

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said the ""stakes are high"" for this next phase of the RFS.

""Ethanol producers and farmers are under tremendous economic pressure, particularly due to uncertainty caused by current efforts to reorder international trade and we need EPA to substantially increase domestic ethanol blending under the RFS in 2026 and 2027,"" Jennings said. ""This rulemaking is a pivotal opportunity for the Trump administration to fully utilize the RFS statutory authorities by setting ambitious blending targets that reflect the critical role American ethanol plays in strengthening U.S. energy security, boosting rural economies and reducing prices at the pump.""

To accomplish this vision, however, the federal government needs to address key gaps that are preventing the commercialization of its own energy breakthroughs.

Many new energy infrastructure technologies in the U.S. face a structural investment gap that stalls their commercialization, often referred to as the “missing middle.” Addressing that gap is essential to enable private investment and markets to takeover and scale a technology.

The federal government has addressed this gap in the past when technologies aligned with national strategic priorities. SpaceX, for example, benefited from direct procurement and funding by the Department of Defense and NASA. Shale gas drilling innovation, in another example, benefited from targeted federal research and development and tax credits. These were strategic investments by the U.S. government that, in addition to pre-existing conditions, created entire industries worth hundreds of billions of dollars in economic value.

To accomplish current U.S. energy innovation goals, the administration has an opportunity to catalyze commercialization of technologies. First, it needs to be careful not to remove key incentives for emerging technologies that are slated to be cut in the recent House budget reconciliation bill. Beyond that, it should evaluate how the federal government can address nine conditions – characterized in a new systemic bankability framework – needed to accelerate energy technology commercialization. needed to accelerate energy technology commercialization.

The “missing middle” gap

America faces a commercialization gap. Broadly speaking, commercializing large energy infrastructure technologies involves advancing a technology from small-scale research and development (R&D) to widespread commercial-scale deployment. To bridge these end points, technologies need to deploy often costly commercial-scale projects over time that improve the technology, reduce costs, and instill a high degree of confidence in investors that projects can deliver predictable returns.

In practice, however, there is a structural investment gap referred to as the “missing middle” that slows the formation of this bridge. Unlike software startups that can prototype quickly and cheaply, energy infrastructure technologies require large-scale pilot projects that have no natural investor. Demonstration projects require a scale of investment that is too large for venture investors, but too risky for institutional investors. At this stage, the combination of risk and investment scale that has no suitable investor (i.e., a “missing middle”) and technology progress stalls (Figure 1).

Establishing systemic bankability to enable private markets to scale innovation

Together with industry and academics, Clean Air Task Force has outlined nine conditions that need to be established to scale energy infrastructure technologies. Widespread and pervasive existence of these conditions results in systemic bankability – access to large- scale institutional capital that enables speed and scale of deployment.

The nine conditions to establish systemic bankability include:

Construction cost overrun risk: The risk that the construction costs projected at the time of final investment decision get significantly inflated during the construction period.

Technology performance risks: Risks related to the technology or overall project not performing as expected at FID, including lesser output than expected or higher operating costs than expected.

Revenue adequacy risk (volume and price) risks: Risks related to whether the project will earn the necessary amount of revenue to satisfy financial obligations.

Regulatory certainty: Risks related to predictability and efficient implementation of policies relevant for the financial performance of the project, including permitting complexity and timelines.

Access to enabling infrastructure networks: Whether a project can access the necessary infrastructure networks for its operations and performance. Networks may be electricity transmission, fuel pipelines, carbon dioxide pipelines and storage, and others.

Social acceptance: Refers to the social license to locate and operate a project within its community.

Robust supply chains: Refers to the robustness of the supply chains necessary to build and operate a project.

Access to commercial insurance: Whether the project can access commercial insurance to insure its financial performance.

Adequate delivery system: Refers to whether there is enough labor to build and operate a project. Examples include financial deal processing capacity and engineering, procurement, and construction management, and skilled operating labor.

Through a variety of potential mechanisms, the U.S. government can help establish these conditions until private markets take over. Notably, many mechanisms exist beyond direct (e.g., grants) and indirect incentives (e.g., tax subsidies), including government procurement, regulatory reforms, insurance, and more. Without these conditions, technologies will not scale rapidly.

The path forward

Energy infrastructure technologies like nuclear, geothermal, and CCS technologies won’t commercialize through market forces alone – they need the same strategic support that created America’s aerospace and hydraulic fracturing industries.

Recent actions by the Trump administration and Congress are having mixed impacts on the ability for technologies to overcome the “missing middle” and achieve system bankability. For most, these actions have largely reduced the ability to overcome market gaps. Proposed cuts to tax credits in the House’ reconciliation draft undermine revenue adequacy for nuclear, geothermal, and CCS projects, and the ceasing of the Department of Energy’s grant and loan programs will reduce the crowding-in of private investment into the “missing middle” gap. In contrast, the administration’s recent executive orders on nuclear regulatory reforms and deployment only partly address the “missing middle” for new nuclear but overall are insufficient to drive new nuclear deployment.

Going forward, the U.S. government will need to address all nine conditions of systemic bankability for its strategic technologies. This includes, but is not limited to, additional executive orders accelerating deployment and improving bankability conditions, and empowering the Department of Energy to help finance early-stage pilot and demonstration projects.

""The ordinance requirements are that 75% or more of those building materials are diverted from landfill.""","Climate change shapes where and how we live. That's why NPR is dedicating a week to stories about solutions for building and living on a hotter planet.

BOULDER, Colo. — Proponents of a growing movement in the construction industry are asking: Why tear down old buildings with wrecking balls when those materials can be mined for reusable materials?

The practice, called deconstruction, creates a circular economy of reuse for building materials. It keeps waste out of landfills and shrinks the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure. It's the kind of idea that sounds like an obvious win-win. But as the built environment rapidly changes over from one generation to the next, communities may not yet have the infrastructure — the sorting facilities and reuse stores — to keep up with new demand.

Deconstruction and reuse industries have taken flight in the past five to 10 years in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where much of the original aging housing stock is now being replaced to suit the tastes of a much wealthier 21st-century population. As old homes come down to make way for new ones, specialist contractors like Anna Perks are moving in to handle the materials left behind.

""Our team is systematically unbuilding the structure,"" said Perks, co-owner of Perks Deconstruction, a contracting company that disassembles buildings for parts. She was hired to make a snug three-bedroom, two-bath home near the top of a green, hilly street in Boulder disappear.

Her crew worked quickly. After the first day on-site, the roof of the house disappeared. The siding, too. A crew wielding hammers and crowbars pried pieces of wood sheathing off the studs and carefully sorted materials. Others clawed nails out of two-by-sixes in the backyard.

""We've got a pretty good pile of lumber,"" she said. ""That's all ceiling joists and floor joists. There's a lot of good reusable lumber in there.""

The workers were trained to work precisely and with patience to keep the lumber as intact as possible as they removed it from the house.

""Typically, what happens is a bulldozer will come in, smash it all — it'll all get trashed,"" Perks said. ""But deconstruction, we try to salvage and recycle as much as possible.""

The carbon emissions embodied in buildings

The idea is to limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the embodied carbon of construction materials, according to Michelle Lambert, the policy and engagement manager at the nonprofit Carbon Leadership Forum.

""Embodied carbon is the greenhouse gas emissions that are generated by the manufacturing, the transportation, the installation, all the way through to the disposal of construction materials that are used in buildings or in roads and other infrastructure projects,"" Lambert said.

For a long time, experts have focused on the climate impact of building operations — the energy used to heat, cool and electrify spaces.

""But in the last five, 10 years, we've really started to understand that the materials and the processes that have created those materials are a really significant piece of the whole carbon footprint of buildings as well,"" she said.

The big promise of deconstruction is in creating a circular economy for building materials: harvesting lumber, say, from an old house, rather than a forest.

""Making use of the materials that we have already manufactured is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce embodied carbon,"" Lambert said. ""Eliminating all of those emissions that would've been required to create new materials.""

The challenges of deconstruction

Chris Fellows, president of Colorado-based development company Resolute Strategies, hired Perks Deconstruction to dismantle a few crumbling farm buildings on a former homestead he's now building out as a mixed-use residential neighborhood in Aurora. In his brief for the project, he included reusing as many of the original materials as possible on-site.

Bricks from the farmhouse and siding from the barn have been set aside in containers. They'll be incorporated into a new community center for the neighborhood.

""This was a place where there's cool history and culture in the pioneers and the settlers that came out and did dryland farming,"" Fellows said. ""We're trying to honor that part of that culture and history of Colorado.""

Fellows said he and his partners also liked deconstruction as a way to cut the carbon footprint of the project.

""We wanted to be good stewards of the land in terms of the climate and the environment,"" he said. ""So, to the extent that we could reuse and recycle any materials, we wanted to do that, so we don't have to consume as much new material, nor do we have to take as much stuff to a landfill.""

Just because the interest is there doesn't mean the execution is easy. A successful deconstruction program requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials, not to mention local end markets — people who want to buy and use those materials. Boulder, for instance, has a robust deconstruction ecosystem that includes expert contractors and recycling facilities for concrete, masonry and lumber, not to mention several building-materials reuse stores and donation centers.

But a lot of places don't have those resources.

""We have to have a place to take all this material,"" Perks said. ""It gets really hard for contractors when there's nowhere to take the material.""

The extra cost of deconstruction can also make it a hard sell. Homeowners and developers may be motivated by environmental reasons, but the economic incentives aren't there.

Fellows estimates that deconstruction increased project costs 35% to 40% and added at least a year to the schedule.

""Because we had to stage things carefully and do them in a certain sequence,"" he said. ""And we had to find the right people.""

Even so, Fellows said he's glad they went for it and even thinks he'll see an eventual return on the investment when eco-conscious homebuyers learn about the process.

""We'll have to check back in three to five years. We'll see if we think that's happening,"" he said. ""But I think it was still the right thing to do.""

On the books

A handful of local governments, from Palo Alto, Calif., to Fort Myers, Fla., and counting, now either require some percentage of demolition waste be salvaged, reused or recycled, or incentivize those practices. Portland, where an ordinance has been on the books since 2016, was among the earliest deconstruction pioneers.

In Boulder, more than 140 million pounds of materials have been kept out of landfills since a deconstruction ordinance was adopted in 2020, according to the city of Boulder's circular economy policy adviser, Emily Freeman.

""All residential and commercial buildings are required to be deconstructed,"" Freeman said. ""The ordinance requirements are that 75% or more of those building materials are diverted from landfill.""

So far, the city has overshot that goal. Over the last five years, Freeman said, more than 83% of the construction waste generated in Boulder has been kept out of landfills.

As the movement matures, Perks said, the next frontier in deconstruction would be to plan for disassembly before a building ever got built.

""Can you either incorporate reclaimed materials into the new design, or when you're designing, can you think about what's this going to be like to take it down?"" she said. ""And when it gets taken down, can it be reused?""

Perks says the future of climate-conscious construction will be knowing exactly how you'll take a building apart before you even put it together.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

The offices of Montana GOP Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment.

The Guidance outlines factors for certain markets regulated by the CFTC (""designated contract markets"") to consider when listing voluntary carbon credits derivative contracts.

Under the Congressional Review Act (""CRA""), Congress may rescind a final agency action, including guidance, subject to certain threshold requirements. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, the rule at issue cannot go into effect or continue in effect. When this occurs, the Guidance becomes ineffective immediately and is treated as if it never went to effect. Additionally, once a rule has been disapproved, the agency may not reissue the rule in ""substantially the same form"" absent additional Congressional action.

The CRA has often been used to overturn traditional administrative rules and guidance documents during transitions between presidential administrations. Since the beginning of 2025, Congress has introduced 26 joint resolutions to rescind Biden-era rules related to the environment, climate, or energy. Two of the joint resolutions have passed in a single chamber, four have been sent to the president but not yet signed, and six have been signed by President Trump. Those signed by the president involve one nullifying the Environmental Protection Agency's rule titled ""Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions,"" another titled ""National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Rubber Tire Manufacturing,"" and various other rules by the Department of Energy regarding energy conservation.

Although not a formal rule, the Guidance mentioned in the introduction is likely formal enough to be subject to recission under the CRA. According to the Government Accountability Office (""GAO"") database, the Guidance was not submitted for review to the GAO as required by the CRA. But the Guidance is likely still a rule for CRA purposes because it announces the CFTC's ""tentative intentions for the future."" Further, the Guidance mirrors formal rulemaking because it incorporates insights the CFTC gained from public comment and from collaboration with market participants. And though the Guidance is non-binding, it outlines the CFTC's expectations of designated contract markets. Notably, the Congressional Record describes the communication as ""transmitting, pursuant to law, a report of a rule entitled 'Commission Guidance Regarding the Listing of Voluntary Carbon Credit Derivative Contracts.'"" Therefore, the GAO would likely find that the Guidance is a rescindable ""statement of policy"" under the CRA.

Both the House and Senate would have had to pass the joint resolution, and the president would have to sign it, for the resolution to take effect. Although a similar resolution was introduced in the House and referred to the House Committee on Agriculture and House Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development, there was no further action on either joint resolution by the recission deadline. As the deadline for Congress to act, based on the tentative schedule, was May 12, 2025, both resolutions have failed. But, although the CFTC has not announced an intention to do so, the agency may still rescind the Guidance through notice and comment rulemaking.

In any event, the joint resolution reflects an effort in Congress to quickly nullify Biden-era climate-related rules without forcing President Trump's agencies to undergo the often lengthy rescission process under the Administrative Procedure Act.

When power plants burn coal to generate electricity, the combustion releases toxic substances as a byproduct.","EPA is proposing to roll back some Biden-era regulations on power plants, including those targeting emissions of carbon and air toxics like mercury.

The proposal comes after LG&E and KU joined other utilities in asking the Trump administration to reverse regulations on carbon emissions from power plants.

EPA touted the economic benefits of repealing emission standards, but the costs to human health would be staggering, according to EPA accounting and advocacy groups.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to roll back all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, in addition to some restrictions on toxic power plant emissions like mercury, as part of the Trump administration's dismantling of Biden-era environment and climate regulations.

The proposal would pose a major setback in decarbonizing the emission-heavy power sectors of states like Kentucky, and also threatens to hamper efforts to improve air quality. Fossil fuel-fired power plants still make up more than 90% of Kentucky's electricity generation.

The EPA framed the rollbacks as a boon for consumers, the fossil fuel industry and the larger economy, and pointed to forecasts of spiking energy demand from data centers and other sources. The agency downplayed the health and environmental benefits of more stringent power plant emission standards as federal overreach.

""In 2023 and 2024, rules were enacted seeking to suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said June 11, ""seeking to make all sorts of industries, including coal and more, disappear — regulate them out of existence.""

Standing and smiling behind Zeldin as he signed the proposals was U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, Republican for Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District. Guthrie, whose district contains Kentucky's western coalfield, praised the Trump administration's efforts to ""unleash American energy"" and reverse what he called a ""radical, green regulatory agenda.""

Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, applauded the proposed rollbacks as a ""critical course correction,"" and called for a continued role for Kentucky coal in power generation amid ""soaring"" demand.

“In Kentucky, we know energy policy isn’t just an environmental issue — it's a kitchen‑table issue,"" Stivers said in a statement. ""Repealing these illogical mandates is a win for every family trying to pay their electric bill, every business owner managing costs, and every utility worker tasked with keeping our grid stable.""

Zeldin said the proposals would go up for public comment, and acknowledged they would likely face lawsuits from climate groups — but said the ""American public spoke loudly and clearly"" in November in favor of the Trump administration's energy policies. EPA also said the proposals would reduce regulatory costs by more than $20 billion.

EPA's accounting of the health costs of the rollbacks totaled about $130 billion, when considering factors like premature deaths, hospitalizations from lung and heart conditions and lost work days. The agency did not factor in the cost of emissions in the form of future climate-fueled disasters, also known as the social cost of carbon, in compliance with a Trump order.

Advocates were quick to denounce EPA's rollbacks, emphasizing the benefits of stringent regulation on power plant emissions to public health and climate.

""These emissions lead to higher rates of asthma attacks, premature deaths and cardiovascular diseases, and are contributing to worsening natural disasters such as deadly heat waves, hurricanes and wildfires across the world, including in Appalachia,"" Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy for Appalachian Voices, said in a statement.

Kentucky has struggled to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, an undertaking climate scientists say is crucial for avoiding the worst outcomes of climate change. And some of the commonwealth's most impoverished communities, including in Louisville, have suffered from disproportionately unhealthy air quality.

""Undoing these standards would make our air even less safe and jeopardize vulnerable people in Louisville, especially children, older adults, pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions,"" Shannon Baker, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association in Kentucky and Tennessee, said in a statement. ""We cannot afford to strip away tools designed to protect them.""

The climate impact of Kentucky's power plants

In reasoning its proposal to repeal greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, EPA argued these emissions ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution,"" and are a ""small and decreasing part of global emissions.""

However, the U.S. power sector was responsible for an immense climate footprint in recent decades — about 5% of the world's emissions from 1990-2022, and more than all but a few countries' total emissions, according to one recent analysis.

In Kentucky, 21 power plants released more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2023, according to EPA data — comparable to driving a gas-powered car from Louisville to Lexington and back about 800 million times.

LG&E and KU, together forming the largest utility in the state, operate three of the five most-emitting plants.

Utilities and other power sector interests have called the carbon emission standards unworkable and argued they would hamper economic growth. In a January letter to the incoming Trump administration, LG&E and KU, Duke Energy and the Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corp. were among a group of utilities calling on EPA to ""immediately"" reverse Biden-era regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, The Courier Journal previously reported.

""We appreciate the U.S. EPA re-evaluating provisions that required utilities to adopt new or unproven technologies to comply with highly aggressive deadlines,"" Liz Pratt, an LG&E and KU spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We had voiced concerns that these provisions could risk grid reliability and would have stringent economic impacts on utilities' customers, local communities and states like Kentucky.

""We share a commitment to a cleaner energy future, and the pace of a clean energy transition — while ensuring there is sufficient energy supply across the U.S. to meet customers' demand and anticipated economic growth — is key.""

LG&E and KU's parent company, PPL, has a stated goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Some advocates are skeptical of whether the utilities will meet that target — and under the Trump administration's policies, they are facing less pressure to do so.

Kentucky has seen firsthand the consequences of a destabilizing climate. Experts have linked some of the state's recent disasters to these changes, as floods grow more intense and damaging, and other disasters, like extreme heat and drought, threaten public health, crop production, worker safety and more. The economic toll from these disasters will continue to climb, experts predict, especially as infrastructure is battered by stronger storms.

Advocates decry air toxics deregulation

In addition to targeting greenhouse gas standards, EPA is also seeking to repeal Biden-era amendments to another set of rules for power plants known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS.

The agency said these rules ""caused significant regulatory uncertainty, especially for coal plants"" in Kentucky and other states. The proposed rollbacks would revert the MATS rules to a less stringent version from 2012, and ""would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade,"" according to EPA.

When power plants burn coal to generate electricity, the combustion releases toxic substances as a byproduct. In recent years, LG&E's coal-fired Mill Creek Generating Station, in southwest Jefferson County, has released hundreds of pounds of neurotoxic metals like mercury, lead and nickel into the air.

LG&E has installed pollution controls to reduce these emissions in recent decades, and more reductions could follow as LG&E converts some of the plant to gas-fired generation.

But advocates said Kentucky communities cannot afford any setbacks in achieving healthier air.

Mercury, for one, ""may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes,"" according to the World Health Organization, and its emissions join a laundry list of other chemicals released to the air near communities in Louisville and elsewhere.

""The American Lung Association in Kentucky calls on EPA to reconsider this deeply harmful proposal,"" Baker said. ""The health of our families, neighborhoods, and future generations in Louisville depends on it.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/02/PLOU/75485950007-mill-creek-03.jpg?crop=2999,1688,x0,y190&width=2999&height=1688&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-13 15:03:43.453214

Zack Colman, Benjamin Storrow, and Annie Snider report for Politico.

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled Biden-era power plant rules and aims to scrap incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, gutting what little progress the U.S. had made on climate policy.

Legal and political whiplash — from Supreme Court decisions to partisan culture wars — has left the federal government paralyzed on greenhouse gas regulation, forcing states like California and New York to attempt solo action.

While market forces have helped push coal use down and clean energy up, scientists warn this won't be enough to hit climate goals without binding national regulations.

Key quote:

“Given what the science says about the need to act urgently, this will be a lost four years in the United States.”

— Joanne Spalding, legal director, Sierra Club

Why this matters:

Politics, not science, is stalling critical U.S. action on climate, and it's a race against time. Even modest emissions rules are now labeled extremist, fossil fuel lobbyists haunt the halls of Congress. Climate change isn’t waiting for bipartisan consensus. It's already showing up in the form of smoke-choked summers, vanishing coastlines, and illnesses driven by heat and pollution.

There are more options than ever with generous federal and state tax credits, plus big discounts from automakers. Charging networks are expanding quickly and if you’ve driven a modern EV from any brand, you’d know they’re far better to own and drive than their gas counterparts.

And yet, EV sales in the U.S. just slipped for the first time in 14 months. What gives?

In the Friday edition of Critical Materials, we talk about how EVs are caught in a perfect storm that may be stalling momentum. Also on our radar: A fight in Congress could kill key battery manufacturing credits, threatening tens of thousands of American jobs that could damage several Republican-dominated states and districts.

And while EV sales in the U.S. slow down, global EV demand continues to grow—China sold nearly as many EVs in May alone as the U.S. did in all of last year.

30%: America’s EV Sales Cool In April

Photo by: Hyundai

After years of rapid growth and consecutive quarters of record EV sales in the U.S., demand seems to have cooled in April for the first time since February 2024. April EV registrations reached 97,833 units, a 4.4% year-over-year decline, according to S&P Global Mobility data cited by Automotive News.

America’s EV market share also dropped from 7.4% to 6.6%. While the trend is concerning, it’s not necessarily surprising or alarming. The Trump administration, despite once having Tesla CEO Elon Musk on its team, is attacking EVs in all ways possible, ambushing the industry and stalling its growth.

Before we reiterate the administration’s tactics to kill EVs as well as the global headwinds, let’s talk some more numbers, because not every carmaker is suffering.

Tesla’s U.S. EV registrations dropped below 40,000 units in April, marking a 16% decline. Chevrolet, on the other hand, is now America’s second-best-selling EV maker—but still far behind Tesla in the second spot—at 9,160 units, managing a 215% year-over-year growth. So this is mostly a case of winners and losers.

All mainstream General Motors brands are going well, with Cadillac and GMC also clocking serious year-over-year growth. What’s shocking is BMW surpassing Hyundai in April EV sales, with the Korean automaker now clocking back-to-back months of decline—that’s despite offering far more affordable and modern options than BMW does and throwing heavy discounts on them.

Apart from Hyundai and Tesla, the other big automakers facing declining EV sales were Ford, Kia, Rivian and Mercedes-Benz.

EVs are really caught in a perfect storm right now. The Trump administration’s budget bill aims to slash federal credits for consumers and for the manufacturing of EVs and battery plants. It passed in the House and now its fate rests in the hands of the Senate.

Moreover, Congress passed a bill—which the president signed on Thursday—to block California from phasing out gas-only vehicles from 2035. Eleven other states including Colorado, New York and New Jersey were also following California emissions rules, so those states are impacted, too—all of them have high EV adoption rates.

There’s another key reason hurting EV sales, S&P Global Analyst Tom Libby told Automotive News:

Libby said that in addition to anxiety over charging and range, consumers are seeing media reports that government support for EVs is on the chopping block and automaker investments in the technology are slowing, undermining confidence in a product that doesn’t yet have significant organic demand. EVs are often popular at launch when they have strong promotions and fresh looks, then they fade out, he said.

It’s true that the administration acts and then the media amplifies all of that. They’re succeeding in their messaging, flooding the digital town squares and the news cycles with their vision for the auto industry, then backing it up with legislation in Congress. The exact same thing was happening last year with the pro-EV Biden administration, of course in favor of EVs.

Whether this sales slump will linger or prove temporary is anyone’s guess. But when EVs are priced right in popular segments, they sell—just look at the Tesla Model Y or the Chevy Equinox EV. And with more affordable models from both brands on the horizon, it’s far too soon to count out the EV market.

60%: American Jobs At Risk In Republican States

Billions in battery plant investments were supposed to make the U.S. auto supply chain less dependent on China and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs along the way. But now, Congress is threatening to repeal the manufacturing tax credits that helped get those projects off the ground.

The fallout is already being felt. Some $14 billion worth of clean energy projects have been canceled this year alone, as the nonprofit Zero Emissions Transportation Association (ZETA) points out. And it could get much worse.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) projects the U.S. could lose 130,000 jobs by 2030 if the credits are scrapped. Ironically, Republican-led states like Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia stand to lose the most.

If the tax credits are scrapped, job losses are expected across multiple sectors, from vehicle assembly and parts manufacturing to battery production and charging infrastructure installation and maintenance.

90%: The Rest Of The World Is Running Away With EVs

China sold 1.3 million EVs and plug-in hybrids in May alone, nearly as many as the U.S. sold in all of 2024. Let that sink in.

Global EV sales jumped 24% last month, which really must sting for a very solipsistic U.S. While the rest of the world races ahead with high-tech cars, U.S. automakers are being forced to crank out more polluting gas trucks and SUVs instead.

As Reuters notes, the surge was driven by BYD’s booming exports to Mexico and Southeast Asia, plus strong demand across Southern Europe. Meanwhile, North American sales took a hit—thanks in part to Canada ending its EV subsidies.

100%: Is This A Temporary Or Prolonged EV Sales Drop?

Despite generous discounts on high-tech EVs, sales are showing signs of cooling in America. But let’s not forget that there are still some excellent EVs to choose from and more are on the way. Think the next-gen Chevy Bolt, smaller Teslas and other affordable models that could shake things up.

It’s also worth noting that early-year sales are typically slower than the fall, when holiday deals pull buyers into showrooms.

“However,” she said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for our Louisiana businesses and jobs.” ‘Punished’ for doing her job?
The email said Tulane University President Michael Fitts was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.
Terrell said the research on job disparities has already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities.
“The foundation the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has already built, they can’t tear that down.","Environmental advocates are questioning the actions of a private university in Louisiana following the resignation of a scientist who researches the health and job disparities in a heavily industrialized part of Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley.”

Kimberly Terrell, who served as a director of community engagement and a staff scientist with Tulane University’s Environmental Law Clinic, accused university leaders of trying to censor the work she’s doing to spotlight the harms to local communities plagued by industrial pollution.

Terrell said her research in collaboration with Floodlight highlighting job disparities in hiring at local petrochemical facilities triggered a backlash from state and university leaders. That led to her being put under an “‘unprecedented gag order” by the dean of the university’s law school, Terrell said in a prepared statement issued by a group calling itself the Louisiana Alliance to Defend Democracy.

Terrell resigned from the New Orleans-based university on Wednesday, saying she would rather leave her position than have her work used as a pretext “to dismantle” the law clinic.

“After being affiliated with Tulane for 25 years and leading groundbreaking research at (the law clinic) for seven years, I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote in a letter to her colleagues.

On Thursday, a university spokesperson said Tulane is “fully committed to academic freedom” and “the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.” Tulane declined to comment on Terrell’s resignation, calling it a personnel matter.

“Debates about how best to operate law clinics’ teaching mission have occurred nationally and at Tulane for years — this is nothing new,” the university said. “We have been working with the leadership of the law school for the past several years to better understand how the clinics can most effectively support the university’s education mission.”

Kate Kelly, spokesperson for Gov. Jeff Landry, said in an email that the governor never threatened to withhold state funding for the project. “However,” she said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for our Louisiana businesses and jobs.”

‘Punished’ for doing her job?

Terrell’s resignation is drawing outrage from grassroots environmental advocates in the state who credited her with providing data and scientific research substantiating the harm from the petrochemical industry suffered by the predominantly Black communities in southeast Louisiana.

“It’s appalling,” said Jo Banner, who co-founded a nonprofit focused on community activism and cultural preservation in St. John the Baptist Parish.

“We are frustrated that a person who is just doing their job, and doing it well shouldn’t be punished for it, she would be uplifted,” Banner said.

Her twin sister and co-founder, Joy Banner, added: “I cried at what is being done to someone who is so committed to just helping people, and doing right, and giving people access to objective information … that she is being penalized and censored so much. This is an attack on her freedom of speech.”

An April 25 email provided to Floodlight from Tulane Law School Dean Marcilynn Burke states that “effective immediately all external communications” from the law clinic that were not “client based” would have to be approved by her. That communication included “press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc.”

In another email, dated May 4, Burke noted that the job disparity research was impeding the university from gaining political and financial support for its $600 million downtown redevelopment project in New Orleans. The email said Tulane University President Michael Fitts was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.

“At present, the president is focused upon the role of the staff scientist,” Burke wrote. “He understands her role in supporting the clinic’s representation of the clients. Thus, I need an explanation of how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”

The email goes on to say, “He is concerned, however, that her work may go beyond supporting the clinic’s legal representation and veer into lobbying.”

Job disparities research cited

Floodlight reported on the research Terrell led for the university in April 2024 while it was still undergoing peer review. Preliminary data showed that minorities were being “systematically” underrepresented in the U.S. petrochemical workforce — despite promises that nearby communities would benefit from better job opportunities.

Terrell said the pollution vs. jobs narrative was oversimplified because the tradeoff affected different groups unevenly, with petrochemical jobs mostly going to white workers who don’t live in the predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods that suffer most of the health impacts of that industry. That research and Floodlight’s reporting was recently featured in a documentary produced by The YEARS Project.

Nationally, Terrell’s research found that higher paying jobs in the chemical manufacturing industry disproportionately went to more white people in Texas, Louisiana and Georgia where minorities represent 59%, 41% and 49% of their respective states’ populations but held 38%, 21% and 28% of the better paid jobs within the industry.

In the petroleum/coal industry, people of color were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs in at least 14 states — including Texas, California, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois, the research found.

Terrell, in her letter to colleagues, said the gag order came after the research had been peer reviewed and published online on April 9 in Ecological Economics.

Terrell said the research on job disparities has already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities. And she said her 2022 study highlighting the health impacts in Cancer Alley ranks in the top 1% for research impact, garnering 28 citations and 87 news mentions to date, according to Almetric, which tracks the reach of research.

“Such impact would be celebrated by most institutions,” Terrell wrote. “Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia. There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”

The Banner sisters are concerned Terrell’s departure and the university’s focus on restricting the work of the law clinic will likely make collaborations harder going forward.

“They’re following their responsibility, they’re following the mission of the organization, and answering our call for help, and then now they’re getting slammed for it,” Joy Banner said. “The foundation the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has already built, they can’t tear that down. No one has questioned her findings. No one has questioned her assumptions. The only thing that they have said is: The truth is creating problems for us.”

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of U.S. biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that U.S. biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—have long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is by far the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,

South Dakota and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:08:01.223959

The commission held a meeting in the Lansing area on Thursday, the last session before Carreon's term ends.","Lansing — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is expected, in the coming weeks, to replace a member of the state commission that's in charge of setting electricity and gas rates in a move that could impact the debate over the cost of utility bills in Michigan.

Whitmer, a Democrat, appointed Alessandra Carreon, a clean energy advocate from Detroit, to the Michigan Public Service Commission less than two years ago, on July 23, 2023. Carreon has advocated for trying to make the panel's operations more accessible for the public. But the partial term she was picked to fill is scheduled to end July 2.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations of the governor's office told The Detroit News that Whitmer's team planned, in recent weeks, to pick someone other than Carreon to fill the seat on the three-member commission for the next six-year term. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the governor's plans.

Carreon declined to answer questions from The News, including whether she was seeking another term. If she's not re-appointed, it would mark the shortest tenure any member of the commission has had in about four decades, according to state records, and raise questions about why the governor felt a change was necessary.

Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer for the nonprofit Michigan Environmental Council, defended Carreon in an interview. Carreon has been focused, as a commissioner, on affordability and residential ratepayers, Jameson contended.

“My understanding is that DTE and Consumers were very unhappy with recent decisions the commission has made around the utilities’ profit margin,” Jameson told The Detroit News, tying the utilities' stances to the governor's upcoming decision about Carreon's future on the panel.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy are Michigan's two dominant electric utilities and influential players in state politics. When they want to raise rates paid by their customers, it's the Michigan Public Service Commission — featuring three gubernatorial appointees — that must decide if the proposed charges are justified and reasonable.

For instance, in March, the commission approved a $153.8 million rate increase for Consumers Energy electricity customers. The Jackson-based energy provider originally sought a $325 million hike.

Asked if Consumers Energy had advocated for Carreon not to be re-appointed to the commission this summer, Katie Carey, spokeswoman for the utility, didn't answer directly.

""Consumers Energy is not aware of what Gov. Whitmer will choose to do regarding an appointment when Commissioner Carreon’s term expires at the end of the month,"" Carey said. ""As with any Michigan Public Service Commission appointment, we will work with all appointees to deliver reliable and affordable energy service for our Michigan customers.""

DTE Energy's spokeswoman, Jill Wilmot, said the Detroit-based utility ""is not involved in the selection"" of commissioners.

""Our team at DTE works collaboratively with the MPSC commissioners and staff to ensure we’re providing safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable energy to our customers and the state of Michigan,"" Wilmot said.

In January, the commission approved a $217.4 million rate increase for DTE customers. DTE originally requested a $456.4 million increase. In April, DTE began pursuing a new $574 million rate increase.

Attorney General Dana Nessel has criticized the pace of rate increases sought by Michigan's largest utilities.

“At some point, we have to ask how long utility companies like DTE and Consumers Energy will be allowed to treat customer bills and our energy rates like a blank check,"" Nessel said in April.

Bobby Leddy, spokesman for Whitmer, didn't deny on Thursday that Carreon's time on the commission might soon end.

""The State of Michigan has more than 230 boards and commissions,"" Leddy said when asked for comment about Carreon's future. ""Gov. Whitmer takes the appointment process seriously. Our office reviews boards and commissions on a rolling basis.

""We will issue an announcement when an appointment or reappointment is made for any board or commission.""

Carreon's seat on the commission might be the last chance Whitmer gets to appoint someone to the panel before leaving office at the end of 2026. However, the person she chooses would be poised to serve on the commission into the next governor's term. That's one reason the selection is being closely watched in Lansing.

Carreon is a former manager of responsible material sourcing for Ford Motor Co. She also managed carbon-free transportation at the clean energy advocacy group Rocky Mountain Institute.

During a March 5 episode of the Michigan Public Service Commission's podcast, Carreon emphasized the need to make the commission's complex processes easier to understand.

""There's really a vested interest in ensuring there's more public participation in the way we do our work,"" Carreon said.

The commission held a meeting in the Lansing area on Thursday, the last session before Carreon's term ends. Although she isn't expected to be re-appointed, commissioners did not discuss her potential departure.

The two other commissioners, Dan Scripps and Katherine Peretick, didn't return calls from The Detroit News in recent days, and they left Thursday's meeting without answering questions from a reporter who was present.

The members of the commission are paid employees. Carreon's salary was $142,151 in 2024, according to a database maintained by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.

Asked about Carreon, Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, which advocates on behalf of customers, noted that the commission's decisions are usually made with unanimous support.

""There are plenty of decisions that the MPSC have ruled on that we both agree and disagree with,"" Bandyk said. ""It comes with the territory of the work that we do is frequent intervenors before the MPSC.""

VinFast was the previous largest economic development announcement in the state's history.","Aircraft maker JetZero, a startup trying to build a more sustainable commercial airplane, is pledging to create 14,500 jobs and manufacture its planes in North Carolina.

Why it matters: It is the largest economic development win in the state's history, if the jobs come to fruition as planned near Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).

Driving the news: On Thursday morning in Raleigh, the state's Economic Investment Committee approved an incentives package for JetZero worth around $1 billion.

The Greensboro area was competing against 25 other sites across the country, according to the state's Commerce Department.

North Carolina has been working to recruit the company for more than a year, including a final phone call between N.C. Gov. Josh Stein and JetZero CEO Tom O'Leary in the past few weeks.

By the numbers: The jobs, which are expected to be added between 2027 and 2037, would pay a minimum average wage of $89,000.

JetZero plans to invest $4.7 billion into the site, in return for state and local incentives.

Guildford County and Greensboro will put $784 million in incentives toward the project, according to the Commerce Department.

The state's contribution, under a transformative-level Job Development Investment Grant, would be $1 billion over 37 years, and it is anticipated the state's General Assembly would appropriate another $450 million toward site preparation and road improvements.

JetZero would only earn the incentives if the company maintains 10,000 workers and invests $3.8 billion locally. PTI would maintain ownership of the land that the state is doing site preparation work on, according to N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley.

Zoom in: California-based JetZero has designed a blended-wing-body airframe that it expects to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than today's tube-and-wing aircraft, a huge advantage for airlines seeking to decarbonize their operations, Axios previously reported.

The company has attracted investments from several big players in the industry, including Delta and United Airlines, and has said it hopes to begin flying in 2027.

The U.S. Air Force is also investing $235 million into JetZero, and Lee said the state had extensive conversations with the Air Force while vetting the company.

State of play: Greensboro's PTI airport has become a hotspot for aviation manufacturers. It's already home to HondaJet and another startup, Boom Supersonic, is building a factory there.

The jobs in Greensboro would include manufacturing roles to research and development positions, according to Lilley. The Greensboro factory would focus on the body of the planes, while Pratt & Whitney would manufacture the engines.

Under the agreement with the state, JetZero would begin hiring in 2027 and reach 14,500 jobs by 2037.

Between the lines: Some of North Carolina's largest economic development wins in recent years have come from startups seeking to disrupt established industries.

That includes Boom, a company trying to resurrect supersonic travel that makes its planes in Greensboro, and VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle startup whose plans to hire 7,500 in Chatham County have been delayed several times already. VinFast was the previous largest economic development announcement in the state's history.

1 Gigawatt down, 1 Gigawatt to Go

The past week or so has ushered in an avalanche of project development announcements in the clean tech space, including an update on the largest solar-plus-storage undertaking in the United States.

The AES Corporation has completed construction of the 1,000 megawatt (MW) Bellefield 1 project, under a 15-year contract with Amazon. Bellefield is a two-phase project, each phase including 500 MW of solar and 500 MW of four-hour battery-based energy storage, for a total of 1,000 MW of installed capacity. Once completed, the 2,000 MW Bellefield in Kern County, California, is expected to be the largest solar-plus-storage facility in the country.

To accelerate Bellefield’s implementation and ensure system reliability, AES utilized Maximo, an AI-enabled robotic system developed by AES to assist construction crews, improving the safety, speed, and accuracy of solar module installation.

What they’re saying: “Completing the first 1,000 MW of Bellefield demonstrates how rapidly solar and storage can be deployed to meet the growing energy demand of data centers,” said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our best-in-class track record of delivering renewables projects on time and on budget is deeply valued by our customers and is one of our key competitive advantages.”

Construction on Bellefield 2 is on track to be completed in 2026. AES has contractual arrangements with major global hyperscalers for 10.1 GW, including the 2 GW Bellefield project.

‘Farm-to-Table’ Energy Company Gets First New York Solar Projects

CleanChoice, which bills itself as the first 100% green company in the U.S. to provide ‘farm-to-table’ renewable energy by owning solar generation assets and supplying only clean energy to consumers, has announced the acquisition of two solar projects in New York State. Once completed, the pair will generate a combined 54.2 MW of clean electricity, effectively doubling CleanChoice’s generation capacity in the Mid-Atlantic region.

The 133-acre Dolan project in Washington County and the 117-acre Hawthorn project in Rensselaer County will each have a capacity of 27.1 MW. Construction of both projects is expected to begin this fall, with a planned interconnection date of Q4 2026 with National Grid. The solar farms were selected by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) as part of its latest round of large-scale renewable energy contract awards. They were two of only 26 selected statewide, highlighting their strategic importance to achieving New York’s goal of 70% clean electricity by 2030.

What they’re saying: “With electric grids struggling to keep up with ever-increasing demand, along with growing consumer demand for more sustainable energy options, investing in solar generation is a win-win solution for everyone,” stated Zoë Gamble, President of CleanChoice. “Bringing a solar project to completion is more than just putting clean energy on the grid. It’s important that we are good stewards of the land by incorporating practices that support the local ecosystem and benefit the surrounding community.”

This news comes six months after CleanChoice unveiled its first solar project, located in Franklin County, Pennsylvania; the company is also continuing construction on a second solar project in Kylertown, PA.

Utilities in the Midwestern United States are tackling tough challenges posed by increasingly extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and an ongoing race to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. State decarbonization laws add complexity to the process of bringing power generation online, and as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, they are simultaneously managing supply chain issues, labor shortages, and new cybersecurity risks. Service providers must modernize their infrastructure to satisfy increasing demand while keeping pricing affordable, which is a tall task for any-sized utility.

DESRI Digs into Catclaw

This week, DESRI announced that the Catclaw Solar and Storage project in Buckeye, Arizona, has achieved financial notice to proceed and commenced construction. Catclaw, a 205 MW solar facility with a 1,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) storage system, is expected to power approximately 40,000 homes upon commencement of operations in 2026.

DESRI bought the Catclaw project from Avantus. It has a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Arizona Public Service (APS). RES will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, with EPC Services Company as the high-voltage EPC. Tesla will provide battery storage equipment for the project. Invenergy Services will provide ongoing operations and maintenance services once the facility is operational.

What they’re saying: “Given skyrocketing demand for new energy and capacity resources across the state, our team is happy to pair reliable and cost-effective resources with this need. We appreciate Avantus’s work on the project’s development and look forward to an efficient build,” said Bob Schoenherr, Chief Strategy Officer of DESRI.

“Catclaw will help power Arizona’s growing energy needs with clean, reliable electricity, especially during times of peak demand,” added Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus. “This milestone is the result of strong collaboration with the City of Buckeye, local partners, DESRI, and APS, and builds on the groundwork Avantus has laid to accelerate clean energy in the region. Together, we’re creating local jobs and strengthening the grid with affordable, resilient energy for Arizona communities.”

DESRI currently owns 131 MW of operating renewable energy assets and 160 MW of solar assets under construction in Arizona, and boasts about 9 GW capacity across the board. Catclaw is its first project with APS.

IPP Scores $630M in ‘first-of-its-kind’ Financing for MISO Project

Independent power producer (IPP) Earthrise Energy has closed on a $630 million, first-of-its-kind tax equity and debt financing for its 270 MW Gibson City Solar project within Illinois’ MISO power market, which is expected to achieve commercial operations in 2026. The debt financing is comprised of a construction-to-term loan, a tax equity bridge loan, and a letter of credit facility. BBVA, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Nord/LB served as Coordinating Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners for the debt financing, and a Fortune 500 telecommunications company provided the tax equity commitment.

This novel transaction is distinguished by its shared point of interconnection between the solar project and Earthrise’s existing thermal power plant, using surplus interconnection service. The transaction is also one of the first solar project financings to utilize the Illinois Power Agency’s Indexed Renewable Energy Credit offtake contract.

What they’re saying: “We are proud to have structured the first solar project finance transactions utilizing surplus interconnection service in MISO. This structure presented attributes that required innovative structuring, and together with the coordinating lead arrangers and tax equity investor, we developed solutions which we believe will serve as a blueprint for similar projects going forward,” stated Kenton Harder, VP Capital Markets, Earthrise Energy.

Earthrise’s current project pipeline represents more than 1.4 GWs of new clean energy capacity expected to be brought online by the end of 2028, with future project financings likely to adopt a similar structure.

Origis Energy Finances a Pair of Major Projects

Origis Energy has closed on the Wheatland solar project with MUFG via a portfolio financing package that supports a pair of projects.

Wheatland Solar, located in Knox County, Indiana, will provide 150 MW of solar capacity and is scheduled for completion in the first half of 2026. It is supported by a PPA with CenterPoint Energy. The Optimist Solar + Storage project in Clay County, Mississippi, will deliver 200 MW of solar power and 50 MW of four-hour battery energy storage. This project is expected to be operational by early 2026 and is supported by a PPA with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Optimist portion of the MUFG deal closed in late 2024. Origis Energy serves as the developer, owner, and operator for both projects.

What they’re saying: “We continue to see unprecedented growth in demand for electricity and look forward to completing this project for CenterPoint and its customers,” noted Vikas Anand, Chief Executive Officer of Origis Energy.

rPlus Energies Closes on Half a Billion Bucks for its Landmark Project

Luigi Resta is helping himself to a second plate of pasta this weekend!

rPlus Energies has closed on a tax equity financing commitment exceeding $500 million with RBC Community Investments and a syndicate of investors to support Green River Energy Center (GREC), a landmark solar-plus-storage project in Emery County, Utah. The financing will utilize the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

The GREC includes 400 MW of solar PV and 400 MW/1,600 MWh of battery storage, with a long-term power purchase agreement in place with PacifiCorp. It is among the largest solar-plus-storage projects currently under construction in the United States and is expected to generate more than $55 million in direct economic benefits for Emery County over the next 20 years. It has already created hundreds of construction jobs. The project is expected to be completed in 2026.

What they’re saying: “Green River Energy Center is an investment in the long-term resilience of a region that has powered the American West for generations,” said Luigi Resta, President and CEO of rPlus Energies. “This project honors Emery County’s legacy as an energy-producing region while helping to secure its future. By utilizing federal tools, such as the investment tax credit, we ensure that rural communities continue to lead our country’s energy production and dominance.”

This milestone follows the successful close of over $1 billion in construction debt financing for the project announced last year.

Soltage Signs the Dotted Line on Financing Facility

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This action represents a critical and much-needed step in the evolution of this program. This is the 20th anniversary of the RFS program. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA’s “Set 2” proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to Congress’ original intent of increasing the use of homegrown American biofuels, unleashing American energy, and supporting rural economies.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

“President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. This move by Administrator Zeldin is the boldest proposal ever and will provide certainty in a much-needed market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American grown biofuels. This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world. America’s national security depends on our energy security, and biofuels are a crucial asset that brings more jobs and helps farmers in rural America,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. “As the Trump Administration expands the domestic market for biofuels, at USDA we are working to break down tariff and non-tariff barriers for our American grown biofuels. President Trump’s landmark deal with the U.K. secured zero tariff access for over $700 million in ethanol exports. Not only can we be energy independent, we are unleashing American energy dominance abroad.”

If finalized, these would be the highest volume requirements ever under the RFS program. Under President Trump and Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, EPA is putting Americans back in charge of its energy future.

Today’s action consists of three major proposals:

Sets strong growth targets for key renewable fuels.

Puts America first by reducing the value of renewable fuels and feedstocks from foreign countries.

Furthers the President’s goal of eliminating the electric vehicle (EV) mandate, by removing electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS program (eRIN)

Historically, the RFS was a “one dial” system, where the only changes to the program were increasing or decreasing volumes. Today, EPA is proposing a second dial that relates to the value of a RIN based whether the biofuel is from domestic or foreign sources. Specifically, foreign biofuels and feedstocks are only being provided 50 percent of the value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

The proposed rule strengthens U.S. energy security by reducing reliance on foreign sources of oil by roughly 150,000 barrels of oil per day over the time frame of the Set 2 rule, 2026 and 2027. Additionally, in 2024, about 45 percent of biomass-based diesel (BBD) feedstock and finished fuel came from foreign sources. By reducing the value of the RIN for foreign biofuels and feedstocks, it will decrease America’s reliance on these imports, promote U.S. production, and increase American energy security.

The Set 2 Rule proposes the biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel (BBD), advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027. The volume targets are as follows:

Table 1: Volume Requirements 2023 – 2027 (billion RINs)a

a One RIN is equivalent to one ethanol-equivalent gallon of renewable fuel.

The proposal supports President Trump's broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices. These volume requirements, if finalized, will protect investments made by American corn and soybean growers, oilseed processors, and biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, whose products are critical to our country’s energy security and keeping rural economies strong.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:18.985022

Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits.
A repeal of the tax credits will jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum and the jobs of Arizona workers.
Ending these tax credits early would slow down job growth, drive up costs, and hurt the progress Arizona has made.
Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits.","A report from the Arizona Commerce Authority, hardly a bastion of socialism and left wing liberalism, found that if MAGA Republicans follow through on their commitment to gut forward provisions like clean energy tax credits in the Biden/Harris Inflation Reduction Act, the Grand Canyon State will lose $58 billion in investments and 69,000 good paying blue, white, and green collar jobs.

Leading Arizona Democrats voiced their concerns about this potential damage to the states economy.

In a Gubernatorial press release, Governor Katie Hobbs stated:

“The Arizona Promise is built on creating opportunities for working-class Arizonans and growing our economy. Over the last three years, Arizona’s economy has boomed, and business investment and job creation have accelerated by leveraging federal tax credits created in the IRA. Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries. The federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success, not undermining our growth.

“Many Arizona communities are benefiting directly from these programs and businesses are choosing to build, invest, hire, and expand with these incentives. A repeal of the tax credits will jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum and the jobs of Arizona workers. Making matters worse, rolling back these tax credits would drive up energy costs at a time when Arizona families are already struggling to make ends meet. By 2029, Arizona households would see an 11.4% increase in electricity costs, and commercial and industrial users would experience a 15.9% increase. Politicians in Washington, D.C., are already creating uncertainty with unnecessary tariffs and an escalating trade war. Ending these tax credits early would slow down job growth, drive up costs, and hurt the progress Arizona has made. As Arizona’s population grows and our economy thrives, now is the time to protect these federal investments and Arizona’s economic future.”

Responding to a request to comment, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said:

“Repealing clean energy tax credits would be a huge step back in Phoenix’s effort to unleash affordable, reliable energy while threatening thousands of good, local jobs. It would hurt our economic growth, raise prices for hardworking Phoenicians, and stunt the development of cutting-edge industries that are delivering clean energy at a time when demand is growing significantly. Our federal government should implement policies that make life easier for American families, and dismantling these tax credits would do just the opposite.”

In the same statement from Governor Hobbs, members of Arizona’s Democratic Congressional Delegation stated their perspectives.

Senator Mark Kelly offered:

“Arizona has worked to make sure we’re a great place to do business—with the help of both Democrats and Republicans over the years. Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits. We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Republicans’ plan to cut these programs will put thousands of Arizonans out of work and make energy prices go up. I’m working with Governor Hobbs and others to stop the bad Republican plan and protect Arizona’s economy.”

Senator Ruben Gallego conveyed:

“Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. Instead, they’re actively cutting jobs. This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families. Slashing clean energy tax credit jeopardizes billions in investments by stalling our state’s economic momentum.”

Representative Greg Stanton relayed:

“If clean energy tax credits are repealed, Arizona loses out on tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and families’ energy bills go up. I want the industries of the future here in Arizona, not overseas.”",https://blogforarizona.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bafkreigssu4yp4wzd2u35estewurz335bgiadtgej4bgu3z6k7qtrtwksy.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 14:00:47.244540

Qualitas has emerged as the leading bidder for the business after interest from KKR & Co.’s ContourGlobal, the other remaining suitor, has cooled, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.

London-based Cubico is owned by Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and PSP Investments. The Canadian pension funds have been working with Bank of America Corp. on the potential deal, seeking a valuation of about EUR 7 billion ($7.9 billion), Bloomberg News reported last year.

A sale of Cubico could rank as one of the largest renewable energy deals this year globally and comes at a time the US administration’s refocus on boosting oil and gas supplies has reduced investor appetite for such assets.

Qualitas may consider bringing in partners to help fund the acquisition or seek to divest some of Cubico’s assets shortly after a deal is completed, one of the people said. There’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, and ContourGlobal’s interest could still be rekindled, the people said.

Representatives for Qualitas, KKR, OTPP and PSP declined to comment.

These investments help drivers save money by providing expanded access to lower cost and cleaner burning homegrown biofuels like E15 (Unleaded 88). The cost-share grants were awarded by the RFIP Board during its quarterly meeting on June 4.

The approved project sites are in 48 different counties and total $1.23 million in state cost-share.

A complete list of the projects, sorted by county, is available here.

“Biofuels provide value for drivers, open new markets for farmers, support rural jobs, reduce emissions, and advance the goal of greater American energy dominance,” said Secretary Naig. “Expanding access to Unleaded 88 gives drivers more ways to save at the pump, and those savings really do add up over time. In 2024, Iowa set a new record for E15 sales, and that momentum will continue as more stations upgrade or install new fuel equipment.”

The Iowa Department of Revenue announced on April 3 that Iowa E15 sales hit an all-time record in 2024, eclipsing the previous record from 2023 by 44 percent. With 256.7 million gallons of E15 sold in Iowa in 2024 at an average price discount of 15 cents per gallon compared to E10, Iowa drivers saved over $38.5 million last year by choosing E15 at the pump.

These investments are helping more Iowa fuel stations come into compliance with the E15 Access Standard. Iowa is the first state to enact an E15 Access Standard, which requires most fuel retailers to offer E15 by Jan. 1, 2026. The law was passed by the Iowa Legislature and signed by Gov. Reynolds in 2022. For those convenience stores and fuel stations that need assistance coming into compliance, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can provide cost-share funding through the RFIP. Since the cost-share grant program began in 2006, the Department has invested more than $62 million toward expanding renewable fuels infrastructure within Iowa. This has been matched with more than $270 million by Iowa convenience stores and fuel retailers.

With additional cost-share funding available, the Department welcomes grant applications to assist more fuel stations in improving and upgrading infrastructure.

The North American grid is challenged by the proliferation of large loads, such as data centers, and the operating profile of inverter-based resources, NERC said.
But “reliability improvements were observed in areas with high concentrations of battery energy storage systems,” also known as BESS.
NERC’s report also highlights the potential for batteries to make the grid more reliable.
In Texas, NERC said battery capacity increased to more than 10 GW in December, and an additional 19 GW is planned by the end of 2025.","Dive Brief:

There were 30 weather-related events in the United States and Canada that caused more than $1 billion in damages last year, but “none resulted in operator-initiated load shed, unlike previous events of a similar scale,” the North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Thursday in its annual State of Reliability report.

On whole, the bulk power system “remained reliable but challenged by adverse weather conditions and transitions in resource mix and usage,” according to the report. “Today’s transmission system is demonstrably more reliable and resilient with the severity and duration of outages declining,” the reliability watchdog said.

The North American grid is challenged by the proliferation of large loads, such as data centers, and the operating profile of inverter-based resources, NERC said. But “reliability improvements were observed in areas with high concentrations of battery energy storage systems,” also known as BESS.

Dive Insight:

The size and speed with which data centers are expanding across the country presents “a significant near-term reliability challenge,” NERC said.

Though there is uncertainty surrounding how much data center capacity will be built, and how quickly, experts agree they are driving up electricity demand. Data centers could account for 44% of U.S. electricity load growth from 2023 to 2028, Bain & Company said in an October analysis.

These large loads can be developed faster than the generation and transmission infrastructure needed to support them, “resulting in lower system stability,” NERC said in its report. “Additionally, the voltage sensitivity and rapidly changing, often unpredictable, power usage of these facilities creates new operating challenges.”

NERC said more accurate models of the operational characteristics of data centers “are essential to reliability to prevent instability caused by these large changes in electricity demand.”

There was also more than 45 GW of new inverter-based capacity added to the bulk power system in 2024, according to NERC’s report. “However, the response by IBRs to system disturbances continues to impact some solar facilities, with ride-through issues being observed at large battery storage and wind plants,” it said.

NERC issued an alert last month which provided recommendations for IBR operators around modeling and performance.

NERC’s report also highlights the potential for batteries to make the grid more reliable. Utility-scale battery storage in the United States is poised to more than double over the next two years and will close out 2026 at nearly 65 GW, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook published Tuesday.

“Improvements in frequency response are being observed in areas of the country that have high concentrations of battery energy storage systems and incentives in place to encourage or require participation,” NERC said.

In Texas, NERC said battery capacity increased to more than 10 GW in December, and an additional 19 GW is planned by the end of 2025.

“While all industrial battery installations can provide frequency support, in Texas RE, the provision of frequency support (when available) is mandated through a Reliability Standard,” NERC noted. “This requirement combined with the increasing amount of installed capacity, quick response times, and BESS often being in a state of partial charge has positioned these installations as a key part of the Texas Interconnection’s frequency response.”

The Texas grid operated through multiple instances last year where batteries provided up to 100% of the total capacity for frequency regulation services, the reliability organization said.

“These events provide supporting evidence that at current penetration levels, with proper requirements and incentives, BESS can improve primary frequency response, an essential reliability service,” said Jack Norris, NERC’s performance analysis manager.

“While challenges and concerns remain with the rapidly increasing penetration of these resources, their flexible capabilities are currently beneficial to reliability, bolstering their viability as a form of BPS energy storage,” he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TxzGzqjHgg6on2P6gn6nKuDRuwHY6_ClN6PiGeMTl8Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JbnRlcnNlY3RfUG93ZXIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:34.741494

Both the Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan, which are nearly identical to their North American counterparts, are confirmed to be getting new generations with a range-extender electric powertrain option.

The announcement came during the 2025 GAC Toyota Technology Day, where Toyota shared plans for a closer collaboration with its Chinese joint ventures, focusing on research and development of future models.

Highlander: More Electrons, Same Mission

First launched in 2019, the current fourth-generation Highlander has been a steady presence in Toyota’s global SUV lineup. In China, GAC Toyota offers it with hybrid and plug-in hybrid options, while a near-identical sibling, named the Crown Kluger, is sold through FAW Toyota. For the upcoming fifth generation, a new range-extender electric vehicle (EREV) version is on the way, which Toyota says is better tailored to the preferences of Chinese buyers.

It’s still unclear whether this Highlander EREV will leave Chinese borders. We reached out to Toyota North America to ask if the new powertrain might be offered in the US, but a spokesperson simply said the company “cannot comment on future U.S. products.” Still, considering the growing demand for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, it wouldn’t be all that surprising if a similar offering was sold over here.

According to GAC Toyota, the fifth-gen Highlander will benefit from large-scale updates, possibly referring to a redesigned bodywork and a high-tech cabin. Still, chances are that the model will ride on an upgraded version of the TNGA-K underpinnings rather than using a new platform.

Last year, it was reported that the next-gen Highlander would arrive in 2026, transitioning to a fully electric powertrain. However, the market conditions may have prompted Toyota to change its plans and give a lease of life to the hybrid Highlander, albeit with a heavier dose of electrification. As for the larger Grand Highlander that is not available in China, it is expected to receive a mid-lifecycle update in 2027.

What We Know About America’s Next Highlander

It’s been reported that the next-generation Highlander will debut in North America in 2026 as a fully electric model, possibly being the three-row EV Toyota has confirmed for its Kentucky and Indiana plants. Could it also be offered with a range-extender powertrain? It’s possible, but we haven’t seen any confirmation yet.

Given Toyota’s cautious approach to full electrification, a dual offering wouldn’t be out of character, especially if it helps bridge the gap for buyers not quite ready to go all-in on battery power. As for the larger Grand Highlander, which isn’t sold in China, it’s expected to receive a mid-cycle update in 2027.

Sienna Also Joining the EREV Club

The Toyota Sienna minivan, which entered its current fourth generation in 2020, shares its underpinnings with the Highlander and Grand Highlander. In China, the model is assembled by GAC Toyota, while FAW Toyota offers a nearly identical version under the Granvia name.

While the fifth-generation Sienna has already been confirmed for China, the North American version is rumored to arrive in 2027 with major updates in both design and technology. As in the upcoming Highlander, the Chinese-market Sienna will adopt a range-extender powertrain, likely sharing the same underlying system.

How the Range-Extender Could Work

Toyota hasn’t released detailed specs for the new EREV system yet. Based on typical configurations, it’s expected to pair a small combustion engine with a large battery, where the engine acts solely as a generator. Propulsion should come entirely from the electric motors, which means drivers get the feel and benefits of a battery-electric vehicle, with extended range and less dependence on charging stations.

In addition to the EREV plans, Toyota confirmed that its sixth-generation hybrid system is in development. This new iteration aims to improve both fuel efficiency and performance. The company also highlighted upcoming enhancements to its Toyota Safety Sense 4.0 suite, including upgraded sensors and improved computing power.

Next Camry Gets a Mention

Beyond the Highlander and Sienna, Toyota also briefly referenced a new-generation Camry during the presentation. While details were limited, it’s likely that a replacement for the current model, which debuted in late 2023, will appear later this decade. Expect it to borrow features from the recently introduced Lexus ES, possibly in both design and tech.

While the materials used in sodium-ion batteries are cheaper and more abundant, the trade-off is significant.
He acknowledged growing interest in alternative technologies like sodium-ion batteries, which some Chinese firms continue to develop.
While EVs tend to dominate the lithium conversation, Kletz sees battery storage as the more critical area in the long term, particularly for national infrastructure.
Kletz suggests it may not yet be the right to time re-enter the lithium market, at least for now.","Lithium’s status as a darling of the energy transition narrative is under increasing scrutiny. Prices have plunged from their COVID-era highs, the market is awash in new supply, and geopolitical trade barriers are reshaping the competitive landscape.

Kletz sees lithium as a compelling long-term investment theme, tightly linked to sweeping global shifts such as electrification grid modernization, and the rise of electric vehicles. But he also sees the lithium market as being caught between long-term optimism and short-term pain. After a dramatic run-up during the early 2020s, prices have since collapsed, erasing nearly all the post-COVID gains.

“They had a boom period and they've since basically given up all of that,” he said. “In terms of momentum, the acute phase of that sell off is seemingly behind us. Charts can change direction at a pin drop but the trend is still lower.”

Additionally, China’s entry into the market with lower-cost production techniques has disrupted traditional supply dynamics as Chinese producers can manufacture lithium carbonate from US $8,000–US$10,000 per tonne, far below the US$12,000–US$15,000 range faced by Australian spodumene operations. This cost edge has allowed Chinese firms to flood the market while remaining profitable, putting significant pressure on competitors.

“Undoubtedly, Western manufacturers are watching what the Chinese are doing, and they're going to attempt to reverse engineer the success that those Chinese battery makers have had in making superior battery stacks,” added Kletz. “It’s not something that gets switched overnight but when that happens, you'll see another wave of heightened interest in electric vehicles in the West.”

Driving this reversal is a surge in supply. Australia, for instance, has rapidly transformed from a mid-tier player into the world’s top producer, thanks to a wave of investment. Kletz also pointed to the emergence of technologies like direct lithium extraction (DLE), which could unlock previously uneconomical reserves in the US.

Yet, Kletz raised a critical question. With so much capital flowing into lithium, could it be replaced? He’s closely watching developments in sodium-ion battery technology, particularly from China. While the materials used in sodium-ion batteries are cheaper and more abundant, the trade-off is significant.

“They have much less energy density than lithium,” he noted, adding that sodium-ion batteries would have to be larger and heavier to deliver comparable performance, something that makes them less viable for electric vehicles, where weight and space are at a premium.

Still, he acknowledged that sodium-ion could “potentially displace some demand for lithium-ion at the margin,” but he doesn’t see it as a major threat just yet. He acknowledged growing interest in alternative technologies like sodium-ion batteries, which some Chinese firms continue to develop. These batteries use cheaper, more abundant materials, raising questions about whether lithium could eventually be displaced. But Kletz believes lithium still holds the upper hand.

On the demand side, lithium still benefits from structural tailwinds. Notably, the global push toward electrification, battery storage, and electric vehicles. But Kletz noted that prices remain highly sensitive to external forces such as EV subsidies and fluctuations in Chinese consumer demand. Additionally, the “the prices can be quite volatile in response to those things,” he said.

Despite China having a massive grip on the global battery market, as Kletz pointed to BYD and CATL as major players in both vehicle and battery manufacturing, this dominance is also becoming a liability amid escalating trade tensions as he noted the US is leaning on all of its partners to take more of a hawkish stance on trade with China.

While EVs tend to dominate the lithium conversation, Kletz sees battery storage as the more critical area in the long term, particularly for national infrastructure. He drew a comparison to earlier hesitations around 5G hardware, where many countries were wary of integrating Chinese-made components.

“The rest of the world has a lot of catching up to do to catch up to China and maybe that's not realistic over the near term. But I think competing battery manufacturers outside of China has a big advantage to displace some of China's market dominance by building out and refining capability for lithium,” he noted, pointing to US grid operators, for example, who might be more inclined to choose Canadian batteries, especially if Chinese alternatives become more expensive due to tariffs or trade restrictions.

Kletz suggests it may not yet be the right to time re-enter the lithium market, at least for now. Despite the long-term potential, he’s hesitant to make any moves while prices remain under pressure.

“I would want to see a bit more of a stabilization before dipping my toe back in,” he said. “I think we’re close to it but it would pay to wait a little bit.”",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/bpm/deni_638854180765705774.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:03:25.916141

Aviation hub grows The 400 aerospace companies that operate in North Carolina contributes $88 billion to the state's economy each year, state officials said.
“But we fully believe that they will achieve liftoff here in North Carolina.” WRAL State Government Reporter Will Doran contributed to this report.","JetZero Inc., a California aircraft manufacturer with ambitious plans to build futuristic, fuel-sipping, all-wing planes, has picked North Carolina for the site of its first factory — a $4.72 billion project that could bring more than 14,500 high-paying jobs to the state, officials said Thursday.

The planned factory, to be built at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, is one of the biggest job-creation commitments in state history, buoyed in part by more than $1 billion in state economic incentives. If successful, the project’s impact could spread throughout the state, sprouting suppliers and ancillary services throughout the state and beyond. It could also play a role in transforming commercial air travel.

North Carolina Department of Commerce officials disclosed JetZero’s North Carolina plans during a special meeting to discuss incentives on Thursday morning. The department’s Economic Investment Committee, which evaluates performance-based grants for growing companies, approved an incentives package worth up to $1.57 billion, including a jobs grant worth up to $1.02 billion. The grant would be paid out in installments over 37 years, provided the company meets investment and hiring targets. JetZero expects to hire the employees and make the $4.72 billion investment by the end of 2036.

“You think about what's going into the economy from this project — that's going to go to every county in North Carolina,” Lee Lilley, the state’s commerce secretary, told WRAL in an interview.In addition to the state incentives, Guilford County commissioners on Thursday approved a separate package worth up to $76 million, to be paid out over 20 years. The Greensboro City Council approved additional incentives to the company worth $1,000 per job.

JetZero, whose tecnhology is designed to reduce fuel consumption and lower emisisons, is among the latest clean energy company to target the state. It's also the latest aircraft manufacturer to land in North Carolina in recent years — part of a broader strategy by corporate recruiters.

""Aviation is a cornerstone of our economy and a driver of innovation in our state,"" Gov. Josh Stein said during a news conference on Thursday. ""This decision further solidifies North Carolina's place in aviation and aerospace leadership.""

If fully realized, the factory would employ a workforce larger than the population of most municipalities in the state — slightly bigger than Smithfield or Rolesville and almost twice the size of Kill Devil Hills, where the Wright brothers embarked on the first successful airplane flight.

It could grow the state’s economy by $259 billion, commerce officials estimated. The entire state’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product was $845.13 billion in late 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

“Not only do you have the direct jobs associated with this project, but you have a number of indirect jobs — service providers, and ultimately, we hope to attract a number of suppliers for the assembly of this aircraft — and they don't all have to be right on site at PTI,” Lilley said, referring to the Greensboro airport. “You can sprinkle them out into other counties. But anytime you create 14,000 direct jobs, that is going to reverberate throughout the entire region.”

Tom O’Leary, the chief executive of JetZero, said the company was attracted to the state’s “innovative, ambitious and capable workforce,” and the quality of the state’s schools and colleges — including community colleges capable of helping build a pipeline of engineers, technicians and advanced manufacturing experts.

“With this announcement, the state becomes the epicenter of the next era of flight,” O’Leary said at a news conference in Greensboro, adding: “This is more than just a factory. It's a launch pad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

Big plans, no flights

The state’s potential investment is a gamble on an aerospace startup with big ambitions — and lots of deep-pocketed partners — but not one flight under its belt.

JetZero’s innovative Z4 plane is still under development. The private company, which is funded in part by a $235 million U.S. Air Force grant, aims to have its first aircraft flying in 2027 and enter commercial service in 2030.

Even though JetZero’s demonstrator hasn’t yet been built, the state felt confident in committing such a large incentives package to the company. Lilley said the state scrutinized the company’s balance sheet, spoke with others in the industry and even the the federal government, which has been involved the Z4’s development.

“They're going to be able to succeed with this product because the engineering checks out,” Lilley said. “There's obviously a demand for it in the market, not only for defense use, but especially for commercial use, and the plane that they're designing is really going to change the way that we do aviation, because it's going to save operators so much money and fuel costs.”

Major airlines and the U.S. government have high hopes for the Z4 because of the cost-savings it promises. Fuel and oil account for more than 25% of airlines’ total operating expenses, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The Z4’s blended-wing design — similar to a Stealth Bomber — is capable of reducing fuel consumption by 50%, according to the company. The design blends the wings and fuselage, enabling the entire wingspan to produce lift, enabling it to fly more efficiently than other aircraft designs. JetZero bills its product as the world’s first commercial all-wing airplane, capable of carrying 250 passengers over 5,000 nautical miles.

More established aerospace companies including Airbus and Boeing, have also been testing blended-wing aircraft. Lilley pointed to the state’s performance model as a safeguard against competitive risks or other threats to the company's viability. Grant payments only occur if the state can verify that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets. The state regularly cancels job-creation grants for companies that don’t meet those targets.

But JetZero is also seen as a viable competitor. United Airlines, buoyed by the prospect of cost savings, announced in April an investment in JetZero that could lead the carrier to order 100 JetZero airplanes, with an option for another 100, provided JetZero meets development, safety and financial milestones. Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air Group have also announced partnerships. Delta plans to offer operational guidance on things such as customer experience, which is expected to be much different in a JetZero plane than in traditional tube-and-wing aircraft.

To deliver the planes, though, the company needs to build them. That’s where Greensboro comes in.

Aviation hub grows

The 400 aerospace companies that operate in North Carolina contributes $88 billion to the state's economy each year, state officials said. Over the years, the Triad has blossomed into a hub for aerospace companies luring the likes of jetmaker Honda Aircraft Co. and Boom Supersonic. Those companies have opened massive operations at Piedmont Triad International with thousands of employees.

During the announcement Thursday, Republican lawmakers — who are expected to appropriate of as much as $450 million to cover site preparations; road, water, and wastewater improvements, as well as the construction of the manufacturing and a research and development center for composite structures — touted their legislative efforts to lower taxes and reduce regulations as reasons for the economic success.

""This wouldn't be possible without state policies that have created an environment that enables private sector growth and development all across the state,"" Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said.

JetZero’s factory would dwarf the size of those operations combined if its plans become reality. The company is likely to need thousands of engineers, material scientists, aerospace technicians, electricians and electrical engineers and others to assemble the aircraft. The new factory is expected to include a research and development center for composite structures.

To build up its staff, it’s likely the company would have to pull from the state’s labor pool and beyond. The company hopes to entice workers with high pay; the average annual salary for workers at the facility would be about $89,000. That’s about 53% above the average private sector wage in Guilford county, according to state commerce officials. In all, the project could have an annual payroll impact of about $1.3 billion for the region.

Aviation companies have been drawn to the region due in part to the state’s labor pool and the availability of workforce training — two things JetZero’s CEO lauded in remarks at Thursday’s press conference. The company and state also hope to train people to become competitive for positions at the factory, and at other aerospace manufacturers in the state.

Guilford Technical Community College has been expanding its aviation program, where it offers courses in aerospace manufacturing, engineering, assembly and repair, among other disciplines. The college is planning a multimillion-dollar expansion that could grow its headcount by about 40% when it’s complete in 2027.

Included in JetZero’s incentives package were services from the state’s Division of Workforce Solutions valued at $10.7 million. The package also includes $32 million for specialized training through the state’s community college system. Those will help the company and competitors bolster their ranks. Local leaders realize it'll take time to build those resources and the workforce.

""This is a long term project,"" Brent Christensen, chief executive of the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce told city officials Thursday as they approved local incentives for the project. ""You don't need 14,000 employees on day one. This is a 10-, 15-, 20-year project that will grow the airport and grow our community. But it won't grow overnight. It will be measured in stages.""

Aerospace isn’t the only focus of North Carolina’s recent efforts to bring in new manufacturing industries, to replace the jobs lost in the furniture and textile industries over the past 30 years. Toyota recently opened a massive factory, also in the Greensboro area, where the company promised to hire thousands of people to make batteries for its electric cars. Another electric vehicle company, Vinfast, plans to build its cars in Moncure, on the border between Wake and Chatham counties, though its project has been delayed.

Former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper made attracting the clean-energy industry a key strategy of his economic development efforts. The JetZero announcement shows his Democratic predecessor, Stein, is continuing those efforts — even as Republican President Donald Trump has sought to slow or stop some of the federal funds and tax credits aimed at the clean tech industry that the federal government had previously approved under former Democratic President Joe Biden.

The JetZero talks began under Cooper, but Lilley told WRAL that one of Stein’s first calls after replacing Cooper was to the company, reassuring them of his continued support.

“The real hard work starts now, because we're going to have to get them off the ground,” Lilley said. “But we fully believe that they will achieve liftoff here in North Carolina.”

Being repealed is The Clean Power Plan 2.0, as well as The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule.

These regulations were seen as burdensome by some in the industry and would have forced states to change their fuel sources for electricity generation.

Repealing these also protected a lot of jobs, saving some mines that were at risk of shutting down.

“This will help our coal-fired, electric industry,” Sen. Hoeven says on the repeals. “We led the effort to repeal these regulations, but the democrats blocked those efforts. So now, the EPA has moved forward to rescind these overbearing regulations.

Jeff Brabant: For example, right now, the cap on full and immediate expensing for equipment for small businesses is $1.25 million.
So this is a small business deduction that cost about $800 billion, the vast majority of that benefit going to the largest small businesses in the country.
Now, Republicans want to make major spending cuts to help partially pay for the tax cuts.
There were small businesses that made a living out of essentially marketing those tax credits and going to homeowners or going to businesses.","Republicans' big tax and spending bill, currently making its way through the Senate, would extend the individual tax cut from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That’s one of the provisions that would lead to it adding an estimated $2.6 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.

Marketplace Senior Washington Correspondent Kimberly Adams has been looking into just how some of the proposed changes in the bill would change the economy, especially for businesses. She joined “Marketplace Morning Report” host David Brancaccio to discuss. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.

David Brancaccio: Now, remember, Congress made the tax cuts for corporations, as opposed to individuals, permanent in that 2017 law. So what's in this reconciliation package for businesses?

Kimberly Adams: Quite a bit, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses. I spoke with Jeff Brabant, who's vice president for federal government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, and he told me he really feels like businesses came out on top in this bill.

Jeff Brabant: For example, right now, the cap on full and immediate expensing for equipment for small businesses is $1.25 million. Congress wants to double that to $2.5 million, which we think is a really good thing to encourage small business owners to invest in new equipment, buy a new tractor if you're a farmer.

Adams: But the big win, says Brabant, is making what's called the ""pass-through deduction"" permanent and expanding it.

Brancaccio: You're the best Kimberly, because you're going to try to explain the pass-through deduction. How does it work, and what is the GOP want to change?

Adams: So if you're a business that's a sole proprietorship, LLCs, or some partnerships in S corps, you pay your business' taxes at personal income tax rates, which are much higher than what corporations pay. So the 2017 law gave an extra deduction for those businesses, but a lot of people have complained that it doesn't really help small businesses that much. Richard Trent is executive director of the small business advocacy group Main Street Alliance.

Richard Trent: So the initial numbers on this are that the top 1% of small businesses are reaping 50% of the benefit coming from that deduction. So this is a small business deduction that cost about $800 billion, the vast majority of that benefit going to the largest small businesses in the country.

Adams: Right now, that deduction is 20% but this bill would make it permanent and boost it to 23%.

Brancaccio: All right. Now, Republicans want to make major spending cuts to help partially pay for the tax cuts. But how might some of those cuts affect businesses.

Adams: Lots of different ways. So for example, this bill threatens many of the Inflation Reduction Act or green energy tax credits. And Michael Negron with this group Small Business Majority and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress gives this example of possible impact of that:

Michael Negron: There were credits for solar to support solar installation. There were small businesses that made a living out of essentially marketing those tax credits and going to homeowners or going to businesses. Same goes for energy-efficient home improvements, and this bill would just about immediately terminate them.",https://img.apmcdn.org/ccd71ad0a57b546572b4a3ab08176760bd6f8013/widescreen/2e0d7d-20250613-the-silhouette-of-the-us-capitol-at-sunset-behind-trees-2000.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:21.987164

It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,” Cooper said. “We look forward to providing more feedback to EPA on the proposed volumes during the public comment period, and we’ll continue to underscore the vital importance of a strong RFS to America’s rural communities.”

Cooper also noted that while today’s proposed rule does not specifically address 169 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions, it includes a commitment from EPA to reallocate any SREs that may be granted in future actions.

“The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA’s plans on SREs, and today’s proposal helps to clarify the agency’s approach moving forward,” Cooper said. “We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump’s first administration. However, EPA’s top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.”

In this round of setting volumes for compliance year 2026 and beyond, the broader liquid fuels industry worked together for the first time, supporting robust volumes and a multi-year approach.

RFA was part of a joint letter in February to incoming EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, cosigned by the American Petroleum Institute and others. “As the EPA begins work on policies that promote American energy and renewable fuels, we encourage the EPA to consider robust future renewable fuel volumes for 2026 and beyond. We believe strong, steady volumes for conventional biofuel targets, biomass-based diesel, and advanced fuels would more accurately reflect the availability and ongoing investments in feedstocks and production capacity,” we wrote.

In April, 16 senators called on EPA to put forward strong renewable volume obligations for the 2026 compliance year and beyond. Also In April, the governors of four states—Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota—wrote a joint letter to Zeldin supporting strong renewable volumes, noting that “For our multi-generational farm families, a strong RVO is more than policy – it’s a critical foundation for their future.”",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/796/1000/EPA-Offices.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:42.059555

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.
The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said.
“North Carolina was first in flight.
The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.","GREENSBORO, N.C. -- GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.3 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O'Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O'Leary said.

The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed three resolutions approved by lawmakers barring California’s electric vehicle sales mandates and diesel engine rules, including its landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said on Thursday.
“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues,” California Governor Gavin Newsom responded.
“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.” The states asked a judge to declare that Trump’srepeal of waivers issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden have no effect on state emissions rules.","A group of 11 states led by California on Thursday filed suit challenging a repeal by Congress of the state’s 2035 electric vehicle rules and heavy duty truck requirements.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed three resolutions approved by lawmakers barring California’s electric vehicle sales mandates and diesel engine rules, including its landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said on Thursday.

“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues,” California Governor Gavin Newsom responded. “And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.”

The states asked a judge to declare that Trump’srepeal of waivers issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden have no effect on state emissions rules.

“The Federal Government carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade lawful procedures that might prevent the ‘take down’ of disfavored California laws,” said the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in northern California.

The plaintiffs include New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington state. The defendants are Trump, the EPA and its Administrator Lee Zeldin.

In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act. Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the Senate parliamentarian in moving forward under the act.

Biden’s waiver allowed California to mandate that at least 80% of new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035, with the remainder being plug-in hybrids.

Trump also signed a resolution to rescind the EPA’s 2023 approval of California’s plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, and another resolution on California’s low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.

The lawsuit said regulations requiring “crucial emission

reductions from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles got swept in for termination too.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors GM.N, Toyota7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG.DE, Hyundai 005380.KS, Stellantis STLAM.MI and others, praised Trump’s signing, saying the EV rules were unachievable and made cars less affordable, limited consumer choice and reduced industry competition.

Alliance CEO John Bozzella said Trump “got behind this repeal before the EV mandates did real damage to the auto industry in America, stood up for customer choice and helped restore a degree of balance to U.S. emissions regulations.”

Experts and automakers say Trump’s repeal significantly reduces the value of Tesla’s EV emissions credits.

The EPA said the lawsuit lacked merit. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies,” agency spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said.

A separate bill passed by the U.S. House in May would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028. Another Senate proposal would eliminate penalties for not meeting federal fuel economy requirements.

Geothermal UK, a coalition bringing together all facets of the geothermal industry, has launched today to champion geothermal energy as a key part of the UK’s clean energy transition.

Founding members include TownRock Energy, Causeway Geothermal, and Eden Geothermal.

The coalition, which includes developers, the supply chain, academic experts and public bodies, aims to unify the sector’s voice and advocate for supportive policy frameworks and investment to unlock the enormous untapped potential of geothermal energy in the UK.

“We’re launching Geothermal UK to raise awareness of all geothermal technologies delivering decarbonised heat, cooling and power, and to speed up the roll-out of this critical clean energy solution,” said Anne Murrell, founder of the coalition. “Geothermal is local and ready to scale, and is indispensable for our net zero future. European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are already experiencing the benefit of their geothermal resources at scale; it’s time for the UK to catch up.”

The coalition’s launch comes amid growing momentum for geothermal in the UK, with many regional initiatives underway and key supply chain trade bodies, such as OEUK, mobilising for geothermal delivery. Geothermal UK plans to serve as the central coordinating voice to support implementation, investment and industry growth.

“Deep Geothermal remains to be a renewable opportunity that we are failing to realise to its full potential. I would always encourage the industry, that understands this very well, to do whatever it can to work together to consistently explain to government what they can offer and the benefits for regional growth, transition jobs, the environment and decarbonisation. I welcome any initiative that helps them to do this.” Dr. Kieran Mullan, MP for Bexhill and Battle and Chairman / Founder of the Deep Geothermal APPG.

“Collaboration is essential if we are to realise the full potential of geothermal energy in the UK. By uniting industry, academia, policymakers, and other key stakeholders through this coalition, we can share expertise, de-risk projects, and build the momentum needed to make geothermal a key part of our energy mix. This is an exciting step towards delivering sustainable, indigenous energy that benefits everyone, ” Stuart Sinclair, CEO, Consortium Drilling

“Geothermal is key to ensuring a just transition of energy jobs, driving local and national economic growth and providing the UK’s energy security. Working together in this coalition is key to achieving scale as quickly as possible,” David Townsend, CEO, TownRock Energy.

“The UK Geothermal industry can transform the efficiency of the UK energy system by reducing the need for electrification. We are standing on a source of clean, cost-effective energy that can be accessed at scale by working in an aligned way; now is the time to go beyond individual projects and establish the systems that will build a new sustainable industry in the UK,” Tom Grand, CCO, Eden Geothermal.

That finding does not bode well for residents who live in rentals without air conditioning.

North Carolina does not require landlords to provide air conditioning in their rental properties. For years, advocates have pushed for an A/C mandate at the city level, but they are met with a common refrain from city officials:

“There's nothing we can adopt in terms of the ordinance at the local level, because we are bound by the state law,” Charlotte City Council member Dimple Ajmera said.

Instead of mandating A/C, the city is partnering with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to provide box fans to at-risk citizens. Ajmera said she has also been monitoring a bill in the General Assembly that would require landlords to provide air conditioning.

“We're watching to see if this bill will be passed,” she said.

However, that bill, sponsored by state Rep. Tracy Clark, looks to be dead for this session. She plans on reintroducing the bill next year. In the meantime, Charlotte residents can keep watch for box fans and cooling centers.

“A/C ought to be a necessity, not an amenity,” Clark said. “It's a human right.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df55403/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1962x1030+47+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F49%2F84%2F67864762457883f6b7a70ad36441%2Fheatmap.png,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:46.981525

Data journalist M.K. Wildeman and science writer Seth Borenstein set out to examine each major EPA rule targeted for repeal under the Trump administration, tallying the projected benefits tied to those regulations. They worked closely with Washington reporter Matthew Daly, who has covered the EPA for years. Many of the data points were buried in lengthy technical documents or had to be drawn from peer-reviewed research and expert analysis. The team dug deep—cross-checking figures, consulting outside experts, and combing through federal documents to highlight the real-world stakes behind the regulatory rollbacks.

At the same time, video journalist Joshua Bickel and reporter Melina Walling traveled to southwestern Indiana to tell the story from the ground up. They found residents whose health and quality of life had improved under existing environmental regulations—and who now fear what will happen if those protections disappear. One local, a lifelong Evansville resident who grew up with asthma, spoke of his concern for his daughter, who’s already showing signs of respiratory trouble.

The result of the team’s work was a comprehensive and sobering estimate: if the regulations are eliminated, the country could see up to 30,000 premature deaths and $275 billion in additional costs annually, largely due to hospitalizations and health impacts tied to pollution.

The team supported its findings with extensive sourcing, including interviews with more than 50 scientists, analysts and current and former EPA officials. The package also featured interactive graphics, produced by Wildeman, that illustrated decades of air quality improvements tied to the rules. Bickel’s video work, along with a vertical-format explainer featuring Walling, gave viewers multiple entry points into the story.

Climate photo editor Alyssa Goodman and senior video journalist Rishi Lekhi edited the visual elements, with Doug Glass serving as lead text editor and Kiki Sideris contributing to social video production.

Top officials, including former EPA chiefs under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, were quoted in the story, and AP’s findings were vetted and praised by leading scientists.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former head of the National Center for Environmental Health.

When it comes to energy use, no one tops Uncle Sam. With more than 300,000 buildings and 600,000 vehicles, the Federal Government is the nation’s largest energy consumer. That means any effort to conserve power across federal operations directly benefits taxpayers, strengthens national security, and reduces emissions.

Since 1975, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has been leading that charge. Born out of the oil crisis and authorized under the Federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (1975), FEMP has quietly transformed how the federal government uses energy, helping agencies save money, modernize infrastructure, and meet ambitious energy goals.

FEMP has been backed by bipartisan support across administrations. In recent years, a bipartisan group of Senators hailing from states across the country—from Hawaii, to Ohio, to New Hampshire, and West Virginia—cosponsored legislation to formally authorize FEMP and establish energy and water reduction goals for federal buildings in an effort to reduce emissions and save money.

Over time, FEMP’s role has expanded to include a wide range of Congressional mandates: from helping agencies leverage funding for infrastructure modernization, to tracking agency accountability, to offering cutting-edge technical assistance. But perhaps its most powerful achievement isn’t written into statute: FEMP saves the federal government billions of dollars.

In fact, FEMP has done the unthinkable: it’s achieved a “50/50/50.”

Over the past 50 years, FEMP has delivered:

A 50% reduction in federal energy intensity

$50 billion in cumulative energy cost savings

And this year, it marks its 50th anniversary

So what’s behind these staggering savings, and how can FEMP build on its legacy of efficiency to meet the challenges of the next 50 years? That is, if its operations aren’t wound down, as DOE leadership has proposed for FEMP in the FY2026 budget.1

The AFFECT Program: Investing in Smarter, Cleaner Government

When it comes to saving taxpayers money while cutting emissions, few programs punch above their weight like FEMP’s AFFECT program—short for Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies.

Launched a decade ago, AFFECT provides competitive grants to help federal agencies implement energy conservation, clean energy, and net-zero projects. These grants help agencies overcome a common obstacle: the lack of upfront capital to fund energy infrastructure improvements. By filling that gap, AFFECT empowers agencies to invest in long-term savings and resilience.

The results speak for themselves. Over the program’s lifetime, AFFECT has funded 160 projects, distributed nearly $300 million, and leveraged a staggering $4 billion in private-sector investment—yielding $137 million in cost savings to date.

These projects align with longstanding federal priorities to reduce costs, support American manufacturing, enhance energy resilience, and strengthen national security—all of which have gotten increased attention recently. AFFECT proves what’s possible when strategic funding meets real agency needs: a cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient federal government.

The Power of Performance Contracts

One of FEMP’s most impactful tools over the past 50 years has been its championing of performance contracting—a financial model that allows federal agencies to upgrade their energy systems without spending a dime in upfront Congressionally-appropriated funds.Through mechanisms like Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs), FEMP helps agencies partner with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to design and install energy-saving improvements. The best part? The cost of the upgrades is repaid over time using the guaranteed energy savings, so taxpayers benefit from day one.

These contracts have helped the federal government leverage billions of dollars in private capital, reducing emissions, modernizing aging infrastructure, and cutting utility bills at no upfront cost.

But FEMP hasn’t stopped there. Many civilian agencies don’t have the legal authority to sign long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs)—a key tool for procuring clean energy from the private sector for agency use. In response, FEMP developed a specialized contracting model: the Energy Savings Performance Contract with an Energy Sales Agreement (ESPC ESA). This innovative tool gives agencies a PPA-like pathway to procure their own distributed energy technologies—like solar installations, solar hot water, wind turbines, geothermal, and combined heat and power.

Here’s how ESPC ESAs work:

Start with a plan. The agency figures out what kind of clean energy system they need and then hires a private energy company, called an ESCO, through a competitive process.

The ESCO builds it—and owns it (at first). The ESCO designs and installs the system and owns it during the contract. Because it’s privately owned, the ESCO can use tax incentives that federal agencies can’t access—like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC)—which helps lower the total cost. However, if Congress rolls back clean energy tax credits like the ITC in the June 2025 reconciliation bill, it will limit one of the smartest tools we have to deliver lower-cost energy upgrades in federal facilities, ultimately costing taxpayers more to achieve the same results.

Agencies only pay for the energy they use. Once the system is up and running, the agency pays the ESCO for the electricity it generates—and only that electricity. The rate must be cheaper than what the agency would’ve paid the utility, which means guaranteed savings.

Eventually, the agency takes ownership. A small slice of each energy payment goes into a savings account that covers the cost of transferring ownership. By the end of the contract (usually within 20 years), the agency owns the system outright—and keeps the clean energy flowing.

So, the federal government gets to invest in reliable energy systems with no upfront cost, guaranteed savings, and long-term benefits. This approach blends financial flexibility with long-term energy independence, offering a win-win for agencies and taxpayers alike.

And the results are real. In FY 2023 alone, FEMP supported 191 federal projects that reported $5.6 million in total cost savings—with actual savings exceeding projections at 101% of estimated values.

Performance contracts aren’t just a workaround for limited budgets—they’re a core strategy for delivering cleaner, more resilient, and more cost-effective government operations. With these tools, FEMP is helping agencies meet today’s energy demands without waiting on tomorrow’s appropriations.

FEMP in Action on Public Lands: Naval Station Newport

FEMP’s commitment to smart stewardship extends beyond office buildings and into the heart of America’s public lands and military installations. At Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island, a 2023 FEMP-led energy and water “treasure hunt” uncovered significant savings opportunities, demonstrating how thoughtful management protects both the federal budget and the government’s consumption of public resources.

The treasure hunt—a hands-on, facility-wide assessment—identified measures projected to save $144,000 annually in energy costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 288 tons per year. These findings not only highlight a direct benefit to taxpayers through reduced utility bills but also contribute to the Navy’s broader goals for energy resilience and resource stewardship.

By deploying FEMP’s technical expertise and leveraging innovative assessment techniques, Naval Station Newport took an important step toward more efficient operations. This case exemplifies how efficient energy management on public lands protects vital federal resources, enhances mission readiness, and supports America’s energy abundance goals.

Why FEMP Matters Now More Than Ever

The federal government is facing a perfect storm of challenges: the urgent need to cut carbon emissions, historic infrastructure investments in need of implementation, rising energy costs, and a shrinking federal workforce stretched thin. At the same time, global demand for electricity is projected to double by 2050. Meeting these demands without breaking budgets or burning out public servants will require solutions that are smart, scalable, and already proven.

That’s where the Federal Energy Management Program comes in.

For five decades, FEMP has helped agencies modernize their operations, cut waste, and unlock billions in savings. FEMP delivers what every taxpayer hopes for: a government that spends wisely, thinks long-term, and achieves true efficiency. As the next chapter of energy and infrastructure development unfolds, FEMP deserves recognition—and reinvestment. However, despite its proven track record, DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal requests $8 million to wind down activities at FEMP—potentially shutting its doors for good. That’s a mistake. For decades, FEMP has helped federal agencies save billions in taxpayer dollars, reduce energy waste, and strengthen mission resilience, all without expanding bureaucracy or growing the deficit. If we’re serious about decarbonizing the federal footprint, lowering costs, and building a more resilient future for all Americans, then we need to look to—and continue funding—the programs and public servants who have been doing that work for decades.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/0612-addy-femp.png,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:23.190504

This tragedy is exactly the kind of situation on workers’ minds when they demand better heat protections.
Heat is an old, old problem for workers, and experts in the Nixon administration recommended federal heat standards more than 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, workers and their allies aren’t waiting for a federal heat standard that may never come.
New Mexico: Another coalition is urging the state's environment department to swiftly finalize and implement the heat standard it proposed in March 2025.","Ronald Silver II, a Maryland father of five, died in 2024 from a preventable heat-related illness after a full shift of collecting trash during a Code Red Extreme Heat Alert. Silver exhibited classic heat-related symptoms all day, then finally collapsed on a resident’s front step begging for help. He was pronounced dead at the hospital an hour later.

Two months after Silver died, Maryland became the sixth state in the nation to adopt heat protections for workers. Had the state Department of Labor finalized its workplace heat standard two years earlier, in accordance with a law passed in 2020, Silver might still be playing with his children today.

This tragedy is exactly the kind of situation on workers’ minds when they demand better heat protections. As members of the Heat Justice Now coalition will make clear during an event in Washington, D.C., on June 17, workers across the country have had enough. They’ve had enough of being denied water breaks. They’ve had enough of broken-down air-conditioning units and unfounded accusations of laziness. And they’ve had enough of fainting, throwing up, and fearing for their lives on the job.

Will federal OSHA finish the job it started?

Last year, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its first-ever proposal for a heat safety standard that would require employers to provide basic human rights on hot days: water, cool places to rest, and education on how to keep people safe.

Remarkably, the Trump administration—which has taken scores of anti-worker actions and embarked on a so-called deregulation initiative—is still moving the proposal forward. June 16 marks the start of two weeks of public hearings, during which OSHA will accept technical and personal testimony from workers, industry groups, union leaders, medical doctors, and many more. In normal times, there would be a post-hearing public comment period, and then OSHA would develop a final heat rule.

These are not normal times.

OSHA already has more barriers to setting new standards than the average federal agency, due to myriad requirements imposed by past presidents and Congresses. Now, because the administration has axed so much of the federal workforce, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, OSHA no longer has the critical support it needs from heat-health scientists. Cuts to the National Weather Service could also hamper OSHA’s heat inspections, which feed valuable information back into the standards-setting process. And if the president gets his way with congressional appropriators, the team within OSHA that develops standards and guidance could shrink by about a third.

It’s hot everywhere. Why do workers need a special heat standard—and why now?

If you’re mowing your own lawn or cleaning out your attic on a hot summer day, no one can keep you from taking a break, getting a glass of water, or even deferring your task to a cooler part of the day. In the current economy, however, too many workers are denied these basic safeguards on the job.

In a review of more than 200 cases of heat-related workplace deaths, OSHA found that employers frequently failed to provide protections such as water, shade, prompt medical care, and time for new workers to get used to the heat. Some employers actively prevented overheated workers from taking rest breaks. Others left sick workers alone and unsupervised to perish from preventable causes.

Lots of employers do the right thing, of course. But as OSHA put it last year: “The existence of adequate protections in some workplaces speaks to the feasibility of the standard, not necessarily to the lack of need.”

As to the question of “Why now?” the answer is partly climate change. Heat is an old, old problem for workers, and experts in the Nixon administration recommended federal heat standards more than 50 years ago. Workers have been waiting ever since. In the meantime, every season has gotten warmer and heat waves have gotten longer and more intense.

Workers aren’t waiting for Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, workers and their allies aren’t waiting for a federal heat standard that may never come. In fact, there are more active campaigns for heat protections at this moment than at any time in at least the last seven years—and lawmakers are taking notice. Here are just a few examples.

Arizona: A coalition representing indoor and outdoor workers across multiple industries is calling on the state’s brand-new Workplace Heat Safety Task Force to recommend an enforceable standard.

Florida: Plant nursery workers are negotiating directly with commercial buyers of indoor houseplants to secure heat protections and other basic human rights for themselves and their colleagues.

New Jersey andNew York: Advocates successfully introduced bills to protect workers from heat and are now pushing for those bills to be passed.

New Mexico: Another coalition is urging the state's environment department to swiftly finalize and implement the heat standard it proposed in March 2025.

North Carolina: Labor rights and environmental health groups are urging the state’s new labor commissioner to convene a robust group of stakeholders—including workers—to collectively chart a more productive course on heat protections.

Ideally, there would be one strong, enforceable heat standard for the nation instead of a patchwork of protections that create regulatory uncertainty for employers. It’s outrageous to allow workers to die from preventable heat-related causes when plenty of feasible, commonsense protections are right in front of us. State and local decision-makers should heed the call for heat justice by moving without delay to protect the workers that keep this country running.

In West Virginia, more than one-third of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural areas.
Finally, Medicaid is a crucial source of care for people living with disabilities, and disability rates tend to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
Not only does this proposal extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s tax breaks for the wealthy, but it also adds additional loopholes that skew the tax code even more in favor of the ultrawealthy.
Polling demonstrates that Republican voters oppose the bill when they learn that the tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit those who are already rich.","Last month, House Republicans passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, on a party-line vote. The bill would make historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and terminate clean energy tax credits that have spurred a manufacturing boom in the United States, all to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans. In so doing, the bill would massively raise costs for low-income Americans, lead to 16 million fewer people with health insurance by 2034 when coupled with changes to the Affordable Care Act, put 11 million people at risk of seeing their SNAP benefits cut or eliminated, and put more than half a million jobs at risk. While the effects of this legislation will harm all Americans, people in states won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 election could bear the brunt of these devastating cuts, even though the bill’s tax breaks for billionaires would accrue predominantly for individuals living in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Medicaid cuts would hurt states and communities that voted for Donald Trump

Medicaid is a foundational pillar of the American health care system, which together with the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to more than 78 million people—more than 1 in 5 Americans. Many Republican-led states are among those most reliant on Medicaid. In places such as Alaska, Maine, and West Virginia, more than 1 in 4 residents are enrolled in the program. More than two-thirds of the nearly 300 U.S. counties that have seen the largest increases in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment since 2008 voted for Trump in the most recent election. Not only do Republican-led states have some of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollment, but the share of Medicaid enrollees in many of these states is largely in rural areas. For instance, in 2021, nearly 60 percent of all Medicaid enrollees in Wyoming lived in rural areas. In Alaska, around half of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural communities. In West Virginia, more than one-third of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural areas. Rural communities, notably, currently vote in greater numbers for Republican candidates.

Medicaid’s popularity and reach extends far beyond current enrollees: Nearly all Republicans (94 percent) recognize the program is important to their local communities, including 95 percent of Trump voters and 95 percent of rural Republicans. People’s personal stakes with Medicaid run deeper than some in Congress may appreciate: Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (62 percent) report that they themselves, a family member, or a close friend have depended on Medicaid at some point in their lives. Among those who voted for President Trump in 2024, about 4 in 10 (42 percent) say that Medicaid is very important or somewhat important to them and to their family directly. These connections help explain why the program has such strong support even within constituencies whose elected representatives have historically opposed it.

Today, Republican voters by and large oppose cuts to the Medicaid program. A new poll from Quinnipiac University released on June 11, 2025, finds that only 18 percent of Republican voters believe Medicaid funding should be cut. KFF meanwhile found that more than two-thirds (67 percent) want Congress to either increase or maintain current Medicaid spending levels. The opposition is even stronger in rural areas, where almost 8 in 10 residents (77 percent) want Medicaid funding preserved or expanded; two-thirds (65 percent) of rural Republicans say funding should increase or stay the same.

Notably, when given the chance to weigh in on Medicaid directly, voters in Republican-led states have repeatedly chosen to protect and expand the program. Voters in states such as Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Oklahoma, Missouri, and South Dakota have all passed ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid coverage. These repeated successes at the ballot box suggest that efforts to reduce or eliminate Medicaid coverage may face significant public resistance, even within conservative electorates.

Finally, Medicaid is a crucial source of care for people living with disabilities, and disability rates tend to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Previous experience shows that states are likely to cut optional Medicaid benefits when federal Medicaid funding is reduced—such as home and community-based supports, dental and denture services, and medical supplies and equipment—which are primarily used by older adults and people with disabilities.

Drastic food assistance cuts would target voters that backed Trump in large numbers

SNAP is the nation’s largest food assistance program and an essential tool to combat hunger when families struggle to make ends meet. The program helps feed more than 42 million people every month, the majority of whom are older Americans and children. Proposals included in the package that would shift benefit costs and additional administrative costs to states, kick 3.2 million people off their benefits by imposing additional burdensome paperwork requirements, and freeze scheduled benefit increases, among others, would amount to the largest cut in SNAP’s history.

Republican-leaning groups of voters would suffer the consequences of drastic cuts to food assistance. SNAP participation is often higher in rural areas and thus makes up a larger portion of food sales than those in suburban and urban areas; as a result, grocery stores and the communities they serve in these areas are at greater risk if the benefit cuts are enacted. Of the roughly 300 counties that are home to more than 27,000 retailers that would be put at higher risk of financial hardship from cuts to SNAP, a disproportional 77 percent of them are in rural areas.

Older Americans in the 50 to 64 age range, who made up the most favorable age group for Trump in 2024 election exit polling, would face additional dangers from the proposal. Specifically, the bill would expand who would be subject to new paperwork requirements from SNAP recipients who are 55 to those as old as 64 for the first time. This proposal puts greater burdens on workers who could be caring for an aging parent or school-age child, or trying to reduce their working hours as they get closer to retirement.

Given the critical role SNAP plays in Republican-leaning areas and that families are already feeling squeezed by the high cost of groceries, it is unsurprising that the vast majority of people oppose cuts to SNAP. Polling repeatedly shows that SNAP is popular, as 85 percent of voters say that the program is important. Substantial majorities support policies that would strengthen and expand SNAP, including nearly 8 in 10 who believe Congress should make it easier for struggling families to qualify for benefits. In fact, 61 percent of Republicans agree that SNAP benefits should be raised, and a majority of Republicans stated they would feel less favorable toward their representatives in Congress if they voted for cuts. This includes 65 percent of white men without a college degree and 64 percent of small town and rural residents—both of which are key groups of voters for the Republican base. This is clearly reflective of the fact that people recognize that SNAP can help ease the burden on household budgets, as nearly half of voters have either relied on SNAP before or know someone who has.

Putting jobs at risk in Trump-won states

Clean energy tax credits enacted through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are lowering Americans’ energy costs, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and expanding the United States’ energy supply. Trump-won states have benefited the most from the growth of the clean energy economy, receiving 77 percent of investments already spent and 78 percent of jobs created. All of this is at risk of being cut if the House Republicans’ budget bill is passed, including more than $380 billion of outstanding investment for Trump-won states. Cutting these investments translates to more than 530,000 potential jobs in Trump-won states that are at risk of being lost, which is equivalent to 78 percent of all at-risk jobs. In fact, 9 out of the 10 states with the most jobs at risk if the clean energy tax credits are eliminated are states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024. Texas alone has more than 130,000 jobs at risk, which is more than the next three states with the most jobs at risk—California, Georgia, and Michigan—combined.

By ending almost all federal clean energy investments, the House Republican budget bill will cause electricity bills to increase. The states that would see the largest increases in their residential electricity bills by 2026 are mostly Trump-won states: Of the 29 states that will see more than a 5 percent increase, 70 percent are Trump-won states. Four of the 5 states likely to suffer the largest electricity price increases (greater than $200) by 2026 are states where Trump won: Wyoming ($225), North Carolina ($215), Arizona ($203), and Tennessee ($202). Given all the benefits of the clean energy tax credits and risks if they are repealed, it is not shocking that most Americans—including Republicans—oppose cutting these clean energy tax credits. According to recent polling, only one-third of Republicans and 21 percent of all respondents are in favor of cutting funding for clean energy tax credits.

The budget plan guts basic needs for people in Trump-won states while the richest Americans get massive tax breaks

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act would issue the largest transfer of wealth from working-class Americans to the ultrawealthy in the nation’s history. To do so, House Republicans are proposing to cut programs that are essential to people, especially in states that voted for Trump in the last election, in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Under this proposal, millionaires would see a larger tax cut than the bottom half of Americans combined—with more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts going to the top 5 percent. In total, households that make at least $1 million per year would receive roughly twice as much in tax breaks as the bottom 50 percent of the nation combined. Roughly 57 million households in the bottom 60 percent would see a tax increase or a negligible tax change ($100 in either direction) under the House Republican proposal. Not only does this proposal extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s tax breaks for the wealthy, but it also adds additional loopholes that skew the tax code even more in favor of the ultrawealthy. Polling demonstrates that Republican voters oppose the bill when they learn that the tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit those who are already rich.

Conclusion

House Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would give the wealthiest Americans huge tax breaks while harming everyday Americans—many of whom live in states that voted for Donald Trump—by enacting massive cuts to health care and food assistance. As the Senate prepares to take up this legislation, senators should reject tax and budget proposals that pull the rug out from under working-class people to fund tax breaks that disproportionately benefit millionaires and billionaires. As the U.S. Senate considers changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Center for American Progress encourages all Americans to contact their senators to plead with them to reject these devastating cuts that would fall especially hard on Republican-leaning constituencies, rural communities, and states Donald Trump won.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/GettyImages-2217881648cropped.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:27.359145

The objective Z4 aircraft aims to fulfill both commercial passenger and cargo roles, as well as become a potential airlift and tanker aircraft for the Air Force.
But the Z4 does not have an inside track to win any future airlift or tanker competition, Air Force officials have said.

The company announced June 12 that its investment will create 14,500 jobs in the region, perhaps the largest job announcement in the states history.

Calling it “the factory of the future, “the new facility will be located at the Piedmont Triad Airport. To enhance its hiring pool, JetZero will invest $30 million in the North Carolina Community College system to develop a “customized workforce” pipeline to supply the plant with staff over the next decade, according to a state government press release.

Developed in part with $235 million in Air Force funding, JetZero’s initial BWB demonstrator is supposed to begin test flights in 2027. The objective Z4 aircraft aims to fulfill both commercial passenger and cargo roles, as well as become a potential airlift and tanker aircraft for the Air Force.

The Air Force is trying to diversify its supplier base and invested in the startup because of the potential advantages of its design for both military and civilian use. But the Z4 does not have an inside track to win any future airlift or tanker competition, Air Force officials have said.

The factory is planned to be “fully-digital and AI-driven to outpace legacy original equipment manufacturers by ramping up faster, cutting unit costs, boosting quality and hardening the supply chain,” the company said. The airliner version of the Z4, which the company hopes to begin delivering in in 2030, would carry about 230 passengers.

JetZero said it has “secured investments and conditional purchase agreements from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines.” About 14 airlines “have joined JetZero’s Airline Working Group to provide input on their needs, including the requirement for the Z4 to readily fit into today’s airport infrastructure.”

North Carolina Governor Josh Stein’s office said the state’s 2.25 percent corporate tax rate and its low cost of living helped attract JetZero, and the company will also partner with Siemens’ Smart Infrastructure, Electrification, and Automation divisions, which are also headquartered in North Carolina, to design its factory with the most efficient technologies possible.

“Siemens also supports JetZero’s design/build/test model for the demonstrator aircraft, a full-scale prototype slated for first flight in 2027,” the governor’s statement said.

JetZero is readying a non-flying ground version of the Z4 for testing and test flights are already underway using a subscale model. Full-scale fuel tanks are undergoing tests and a wing test article is being evaluated. Cockpit tooling is complete, company officials said, and the critical design review for the demonstrator is expected “soon.”

Once the North Carolina facility is completed, the company will move its headquarters to the new site.

The company describes the Z-4 as “a game-changer, slashing fuel burn, emissions and costs with its ultra-efficient all-wing body design. By maximizing lift and minimizing drag, it will deliver up to 50 percent greater fuel efficiency and associated emissions reduction.” The aircraft will also deliver “a cleaner, quieter and improved travel experience” in airliner service, and be able to operate out of airfields with shorter runways, JetZero said.

The aircraft is being designed and developed in California with the help of Northrop Grumman’s Scaled Composites unit, and is expected to enter commercial service “in the early 2030s.”

Northrop and JetZero are expected to offer a “KC-Z4” version of the aircraft for the Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Refueling system (NGAS) requirement. The concept aircraft would have a gross operating weight of 362,000 pounds, with a total fuel load of 200,000 pounds; that’s comparable to today’s KC-135 and KC-46 aerial refueling jets. But the efficiency of the blended wing-body promises greater range and its cargo capacity is anticipated to exceed the KC-46, 21 pallets versus 18, a difference of about 17 percent.

A cargo-only version would also require a rear ramp, which is not part of the prototype effort, and would require a different tail design, company officials said.",https://www.airandspaceforces.com/app/uploads/2025/06/JetZero-Z4.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 11:02:23.617582

With the installation of a 1.49-MW solar power system on the roof of the factory, Bloomsburg dramatically reduced its operating overhead and energy costs.
Bowman led the effort to bring clean energy to the company’s rooftop to avoid these ballooning energy costs.
That’s when he turned to Evergrow for help finding a buyer and navigating the required tax-credit diligence process.
“We’re proud to support family-owned manufacturers like Bloomsburg Carpet in their transition to clean energy,” said James Richards, CEO of Evergrow.","Evergrow has successfully completed a tax-credit transfer for a rooftop solar project at a carpet factory in Pennsylvania — a much needed energy source for the factory that would not have been possible without incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Bloomsburg Carpet Industries in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, is a third-generation, family-owned manufacturer of carpets for iconic institutions, including the House and Senate Chambers of the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Supreme Court, Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. With the installation of a 1.49-MW solar power system on the roof of the factory, Bloomsburg dramatically reduced its operating overhead and energy costs.

With more than 30 looms operating daily, Bloomsburg’s energy demands are significant. CFO Adam Bowman saw that inaction would expose the company to the higher energy costs that energy industry analysts warn will result from a historic rise in electricity demand unfolding across the United States. Industry experts project electricity demand to rise 25% by 2030, leading to higher electricity prices for consumers. For manufacturers like Bloomsburg, the annual cost increases could be staggering.

Bowman led the effort to bring clean energy to the company’s rooftop to avoid these ballooning energy costs. A combination of incentives had started to make going solar more attractive. But it was ultimately the successful sale and transfer of the tax credits generated by the solar installation that got the financing over the finish line.

At just under $2.2 million in qualifying costs, Bloomsburg’s rooftop solar system earned approximately $660,000 in investment tax credits (ITC). Under the IRA, the ITC was made transferable, meaning taxpayers like Bloomsburg can sell their credits to investors after the project is placed into service. This allows small businesses like Bloomsburg to rely less on debt financing to get their projects off the ground.

Bowman initially tried to find a buyer for the credits himself. But as an independent, family-owned business, he encountered difficulties: Buyers worried about the potential risk of tax-credit recapture. Under the law, if a business is forced to sell the asset that generated the tax credits within five years, some or all of the credits can be “recaptured” by the IRS. For this reason, buyers tend to prefer sellers with a track record of long-term project ownership and sufficient assets to cover an indemnity. Bowman found that even though Bloomsburg Carpet had enjoyed decades of good financial standing, buyers still balked.

That’s when he turned to Evergrow for help finding a buyer and navigating the required tax-credit diligence process. Evergrow uses technology to partially automate the diligence process, making it easier for non-experts like Bowman to provide documentation and complete the process. The company also supplies buyers with a diligence guarantee — meaning buyers are reimbursed for any recapture-related losses. Designed to overcome exactly the kinds of barriers Bowman had faced when trying to go it alone, the Evergrow Guarantee provides full assurance to tax-credit buyers that they’ll be reimbursed in the unlikely event of an IRS recapture.

“Evergrow was on our side the whole time,” said Bowman. “The Evergrow Guarantee was really essential — I don’t think the deal would’ve gotten done without it.”

The project’s impact is already being felt. Bloomsburg is now saving approximately $200,000 per year on electricity costs, plus an additional $50,000 annually from Pennsylvania’s Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program. These savings, along with an improved Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) score, strengthen Bloomsburg’s environmental leadership in the textile industry. More details on the transaction are available in this case study published on Evergrow’s website.

“We’re proud to support family-owned manufacturers like Bloomsburg Carpet in their transition to clean energy,” said James Richards, CEO of Evergrow. “This project is a model for how commercial and industrial businesses of any size can take full advantage of clean energy incentives like the ITC — with the right financial partner.”

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.
'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process.","Emerging science shows geologic hydrogen, created under the Earth's crust naturally, may exist in pools that can be extracted for clean energy.

A U.S. Geological Survey study of where geologic hydrogen could potentially be found shows Michigan as a particularly promising site.

Imagine an abundant form of energy that's so clean, when you burn it, it doesn't create carbon or greenhouse gases; it creates water. Imagine that unlike oil and gas, where when you take it out of the ground it's gone, this underground energy source can be stimulated to keep reproducing itself, creating wells that never run out.

Now imagine that energy source being abundant beneath the surface of the U.S. — and that Michigan in particular is teeming with it.

Emerging science is showing all of the above appears true, but there is a lot more work to do before this potentially revolutionary energy source can be unlocked on a large scale.

It's not some exotic, newly discovered element, but the most ubiquitous one in the universe: hydrogen. It's been used for years in producing metals, in hydrogenating cooking oils for better shelf life, and in the creation of ammonia for nitrogen-based fertilizers used on farm fields across the globe. But that hydrogen comes at a cost, from applying electricity to water — H₂O, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom — to separate the two elements and retain the hydrogen. Natural gas is often used to provide the energy for that process, but that's expensive and, while better than coal or oil, still pollutes the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are also being applied to this hydrogen extraction process, but it's difficult and costly to do at scale.

Hydrogen is created naturally underground through a reaction between water and certain iron-rich rocks, a process known as serpentinization, or through radiolysis, where natural radiation deep in the Earth breaks down water molecules to produce hydrogen. But scientists for generations — to the extent they thought about geologic hydrogen at all — considered it so diffusive and reactive they believed most was dissipated or converted to some other compound. Historically, when hydrogen pockets were discovered in drilling or mining, it wasn't identified or quantified.. Rather, it was often considered a nuisance to remove so that miners and drillers could get what they really were after: oil, gas, and minerals.

Scientists only recently discovered that geologic hydrogen potentially remains trapped in rock layers in pools that could be tapped, maybe even on a commercial scale.

In a study published earlier this year, geologists with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a multi-faceted map of the prospectivity of geologic hydrogen in the continental U.S. They looked for areas with all the right ingredients: a source of sufficient hydrogen generation — iron-rich rock is an important catalyst; porous underground reservoirs for storage; and a sufficient layer of sealing cap rock to contain the hydrogen pools and prevent leaking.

The study found that a large swath through the middle of the country has great potential to contain collected pools of geologic hydrogen — and Michigan in particular was one of the areas that really showed promise.

""The source of the hydrogen, the reservoir and the seal, Michigan in particular happens to have all of these ingredients all overlaid with one another, plus a handful of other things that we mapped out,"" said Jane Hearon, a USGS geologist and co-author of the study.

""It was kind of interesting and fun to see Michigan light up that way because you don't think of it as like a Texas, one of these states that has a longstanding tradition of energy production.""

And while one path of research is looking into where geologic hydrogen may be naturally occurring, another is looking into places with the right rock formations and other ingredients where the gas may be stimulated into existence and produced, through injection of water into rock and perhaps with some catalysts such as other elements and microbes, said USGS geologist Sarah Gelman, a co-author on the prospectivity mapping study.

Then-President Joe Biden's Department of Energy in February 2024 announced $20 million in grants to 16 institutions looking into geologic hydrogen's energy potential, including 10 institutions working on stimulated hydrogen projects.

""It's a bit simpler versus finding the accumulations, because you just go where the right rocks are,"" Gelman said. ""But it's got a lot of engineering challenges, and that's where that body of research (is needed).""

Stimulated hydrogen holds promise for iron-rich regions without natural underground reservoirs for accumulating naturally created hydrogen, such as ""the Upper Peninsula and into Minnesota,"" she said.

""It doesn't mean all hope is lost there,"" Gelman said. ""There is some good, good potential (for stimulated hydrogen production).""

170,000 years' worth of energy, created by the Earth

The Earth has produced enough hydrogen under its crust to meet the entire planet's energy needs for 170,000 years — but most of it is lost or inaccessible, said Christopher Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford in England.

""But what it does mean is we only need to find a small amount of it for it to be useful societally,"" he said.

Ballentine pointed to USGS studies showing there's potentially enough geologic hydrogen which ""has the potential to be found and discovered and produced"" to meet society's increasing hydrogen demands for the next 200 years.

That has piqued the interest of the oil, gas and mineral extraction world.

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

""The industry is following the money,"" Ballentine said. ""About five years ago, there were zero companies in this space. Two years ago, there were 40. There are probably double that today.""

But prospectivity means places where stored, naturally occurring underground hydrogen may be, where the conditions are ripe for it. But it's not a certainty, and searching for it is a costly process that oil and gas production companies approach carefully.

""There are a lot of smaller startups, a lot of independent new companies that are interested in this,"" Gelman said. ""The oil majors are often interested and sitting back and watching a little bit, but they will be the fast followers.""

""We want to get to the wells − that's the exciting part; they actually call it the rotary lie detector, where you figure out what's down there. But there is a lot of groundwork and geology that we're trying to provide to American industry and American policy makers to try and help ease this initial stage.""

Interest, but not much activity so far in Michigan

Current U.S. exploration and drilling for geologic hydrogen occurs most intensely in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, along the Midcontinent Rift, a geologic formation in the middle U.S. where the Earth's crust began to pull apart millions of years ago. That activity hasn't occurred in Michigan — yet.

""We’ve been following the increased attention on geologic hydrogen, and the prospectivity map certainly shows Michigan in the darkest blues for prospectivity,"" said Adam Wygant, director of the Geologic Resources Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

""Our sense is there is a fair amount of research going on and companies looking at potential in Michigan,"" both for naturally occurring underground pools and for stimulated hydrogen production.

State officials are encouraging any companies doing geologic testing to include hydrogen in their tests, to better learn where it's found and help zero in on those more costly exploration methods, Wygant said.

Michigan is prepared to regulate any hydrogen production activities through its existing laws, and is monitoring other states where geologic hydrogen exploration is farther along to help identify administrative rules and procedures, he said. The actual extraction process would not be remarkably different from an oil or natural gas well.

""But the hydrogen molecule is a little different from a methane molecule — it’s pesky; it doesn’t like to be contained,"" Wygant said.

""There are specialty products that would be used in well construction, in cements, in surface infrastructure, to properly maintain it.""

Finding the recipe for reproducing hydrogen underground

Multiple avenues of geologic hydrogen research are under pursuit at Sandia National Laboratories, a federally owned facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International that works on advancing science on energy, national security and other issues.

The lab is participating in a research project experimenting with certain rock types and characterizing how much hydrogen they produce under different conditions, the keys to producing stimulated hydrogen.

""They're doing microbes, catalysts, different chemicals, steam, working at different temperatures,"" said Sandia geologist Franek Hasiuk. ""Right now, the race is to find the right recipe, and there have been early positive results with some of these techniques.""

""We can either do those chemical reactions down in a well deep underground, or we can even do it at a mine, and it's actually a way we could use old mine tailings and mine waste to produce new energy and new revenue streams that can help clean up those mine wastes.""

Sandia is also funding an internal research and development project on the molecular and atomic processes involved in geologic production of hydrogen.

""There is a long way to go; there is still a lot to discover,"" said Donald Conley, acting senior manager of the Geosciences Research and Applications Group at Sandia.

""We are guiding the conversation to what's next for geologic hydrogen. Once we find all these discoveries, how do we make it a viable part of the U.S. energy economy?""

An accidental find helps an African village meet its power needs

Workers drilling a water well in the village of Bourakėbougou in the African nation of Mali in 1987 accidentally hit a vein of geologic hydrogen — a discovery confirmed after a worker lit a cigarette and the gas exploded. The well hole was capped with cement for safety reasons and forgotten until 2012, when Hydroma, a company based in Canada, began a pilot project combusting the hydrogen from the well to produce electricity for the village.

""For more than 7 years, the village of Bourakébougou benefited from free electricity without CO₂ emissions,"" the company states on its website. The company has since proven the existence of other nearby pools of geologic hydrogen, has expanded its footprint in other parts of Africa, and has opened a U.S. division.

A reservoir of geologic hydrogen discovered at an abandoned chromium mine in Albania, and reserves discovered in France's Lorraine region, have also sparked development interest.

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.

""When the oil and gas industry started, it was also just like that, very localized pockets where you had oil seeping out of the ground,"" he said. ""In one place, they would use it to line the outside of ships to make them waterproof, or they'd use it in making patent medicines and things like that. It was really when we started moving from collecting it from places where it seeped out of the ground to drilling nearby that we were able to unlock these larger volumes.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

Losing federal solar credits “would devastate the solar industry” in Michigan, said O’Shea, the president of CBS Solar.
“Lynda and I and our 25 employees plead with you to leave the solar tax credits intact,” he wrote (Lynda is his wife).
On June 6, Solar Mosaic, a California-based company that offers loans for solar projects, filed for bankruptcy.","The loss of federal tax credits for rooftop solar could wreck the business that Allan O’Shea has built in Michigan. O’Shea, who runs his company along with his wife and sons, has been selling solar panels since the 1990s.

He’s witnessed the growing popularity of rooftop solar in the state, which accounted for 19 percent of the state’s total solar power in 2023. Across the nation, residential solar has continually set records for new installations, growing every year for the past five years.

Progress for solar in the United States was kicked into high gear by record-high tax credits for renewable energy, implemented in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Now, the federal budget reconciliation bill, officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” threatens to halt that progress.

In its current draft form, the bill proposes ending the residential clean energy tax credit, which allows residents to get 30 percent off the cost of new clean energy projects, like solar panels, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. It would also end a 30 percent tax credit for companies that lease solar panels to homes and businesses. The bill has already left the House, where it passed by one vote, and is currently being debated in the Senate.

I’m focusing on Michigan because it’s a place that has stood out for the pace of growth in its renewable energy economy.

Since 2022, new clean energy projects there have garnered $27.84 billion in investments and created 26,352 jobs. There have been more new clean energy projects launched in Michigan than any other state, according to a report from Climate Power. Nearly 40 percent of those are in Republican-held congressional districts.

Losing federal solar credits “would devastate the solar industry” in Michigan, said O’Shea, the president of CBS Solar. When we talked on the phone this week, he was in the middle of sending letters to his representatives in Congress, asking them to oppose the federal cuts. “Lynda and I and our 25 employees plead with you to leave the solar tax credits intact,” he wrote (Lynda is his wife). “The effort by the House to balance the budget on the backs of more than 3,000 Michigan solar employees is ill advised and wrong.”

For customers looking to save money on their energy bills, the federal clean energy tax credit has been a key incentive bringing them to CBS Solar. O’Shea said losing the clean energy tax credit would double the amount of time it will take his customers to recoup the costs of installing solar panels, from around 10 years to 20.

It could also make it difficult, or even impossible, for his business to continue. Part of what would make it so challenging is how quickly the change would happen; cuts would go into effect immediately after the bill passes. On the other hand, the 30 percent tax credit for commercial and utility-scale projects is set to stay in place until 2029.

If residential solar tax credits were reduced over the same timeline, O’Shea said it would give his business and other small solar companies a better chance of surviving.

“You’re just talking about pulling the rug out from the solar residential industry,” he said. That will have a direct impact on how many people he can employ. “These are good jobs created for many people that don’t have a college degree. They’re paying their taxes, they’re hard working Americans all over rural America. It would be really a shame to have that loss.”

A majority of job losses from losing the clean energy tax credit will be in states won by President Trump in 2024, according to an analysis by the Solar Energy Industry Association. SEIA calculates that removing solar tax incentives would result in 330,000 jobs lost across the country, 331 factories closed or cancelled and nearly $300 billion in local investments erased.

Policy changes since Trump’s election have already brought challenges to the solar industry. In 2024, more than 100 solar contractors went bankrupt. On June 6, Solar Mosaic, a California-based company that offers loans for solar projects, filed for bankruptcy. Just a few days later, Sunnova Energy, a leading U.S. residential solar installer, followed suit.

O’Shea is getting questions from customers, asking: “Is this really going to happen? Can you fit me in before the end of the year? Why is this happening?”

Under the bill’s current language, if they are able to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and are online by 2028, they’ll still qualify for credits. But O’Shea expects that such a short timeframe will make it hard in particular for churches, schools and nonprofits to get organized in time. “There’s a whole lot of good people out there who are going to lose the opportunity,” he said.

While these cuts would certainly make renewables more expensive, “it’s also very likely that things the Trump administration are doing will make non-renewable power generation more expensive too,” said Douglas Jester, managing partner at 5 Lakes Energy, where he advises clean energy trade associations.

Tariffs on imported parts for natural gas plants, for example, could raise energy prices. “I do think we’ll still see growth in solar in Michigan, but it might not grow as fast,” he said.

For now, O’Shea and his staff are waiting to see what will happen—whether the Senate will support his company’s interests or not, and if they’ll be able to adjust enough to make it through.

“I have two sons in the business,” he said. “I wanted to leave them something, but I can’t be sure of that anymore.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

Fate of Energy Tax Credits Falls to Republican Senators: Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits that would benefit Republican districts will disappear if the Senate passes the bill in its current form. Multiple Republican senators have said they want major changes to the bill, while others have vowed to vote against it if any clean energy subsidies are preserved, as Arianna Skibell reports for Politico. The Senate can only afford to lose three votes.

Sunnova and Mosaic Bankruptcies Are Part of a Bigger Story of Challenges for Rooftop Solar: Federal cuts to clean energy tax credits are only the latest threat to residential solar companies. High interest rates, plus policy changes in California—the country’s largest rooftop solar market—have all made operations much more expensive in recent years. But Sunnova and Mosaic also made poor business decisions, taking on serious debt that made them particularly vulnerable to collapse, reports Jeff St. John for Canary Media. Experts say it’s still too early to say what these bankruptcies mean for the industry at large.

Developer Seeks to Cancel New Jersey Offshore Wind Project, Citing Political Opposition: Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind had planned to build a 1.5-gigawatt offshore wind project that would have powered 700,000 New Jersey homes.

From Maryland Matters

Martyland is one of the states that adopted the California standards, which would have required electric vehicles to account for 43% of new cars sold in the state by 2027, growing annually until they made up 100% in model year 2028. The state was lagging behind in the move to hithomopidiitveseventually reaching 100% by the 2035 model year.

President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you’re going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",https://southernmarylandchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-and-lawmakers-1536x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:09:14.344595

The government has confirmed that the spending review allocated landmark new funding to create hydrogen infrastructure, including the first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, and connecting hydrogen producers with vital end-users, such as power stations and industry, for the first time.

This major infrastructure boost will help deliver clean energy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber, as well as in the supply chain.

This will ensure communities across the country feel the benefits of Britain’s renewal while reducing reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets.

Benefits of clean energy jobs for the economy

Today’s announcement also follows confirmation in the Spending Review that the government is creating thousands of clean energy jobs nationwide.

10,000 jobs will be created at Sizewell C in Suffolk, a new fusion reactor to be built on the site of an old power station in Nottinghamshire.

Additionally, up to 3,000 jobs are expected to be created through the small modular reactor programme. Funding is also being allocated to kickstart the Acorn project in Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber.

This will support manufacturing sectors that are likely to require hydrogen infrastructure, such as iron, steel, glass, chemicals, and ceramics, forming part of the government’s long-term plan to invest in and secure the country’s industrial future.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain.

“By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.”

The unique role of hydrogen infrastructure in the UK’s energy system

The funding will unlock the unique role of hydrogen infrastructure in Britain’s energy system, where it can decarbonise industrial sectors including refineries and heavy transport, while providing long-term energy storage that can be deployed during peak demand periods.

The funding also enables progress in supporting low-carbon hydrogen production through continued Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), building on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round, which saw 11 projects allocated over £2bn in government funding.

“Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition,” explained Brett Ryan, Head of Policy and Analysis at Hydrogen UK.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, added: “By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.”

Hydrogen infrastructure has already attracted £400m of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire.

California files multi-state lawsuit following President Trump’s quashing of the state’s envi...

California files multi-state lawsuit following President Trump’s quashing of the state’s environmentally friendly auto-emissions rules.

The State of California has launched a fresh legal broadside against the US administration, filing a claim late on Thursday 12 June in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in a bid to overturn last-minute federal moves that strip the state of its authority to police vehicle emissions. Joined by ten other Democratic-leaning states – including New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington – the claimants are asking the court to declare unlawful three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions that President Trump signed only hours earlier. Those resolutions extinguish Environmental Protection Agency waivers granted in 2022 and 2023 that underpin California’s plan to phase out sales of new petrol-only cars by 2035, impose stricter low-nitrogen-oxide limits on heavy-duty engines and require a rapid roll-out of zero-emission lorries.

ALL-OUT ASSAULT

At the White House, the president heralded the repeal as salvation for motorists and manufacturers alike. “We officially rescue the US auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric-vehicle (EV) mandate once and for all,” he declared, accusing Sacramento of “lunatic” climate policies that would make cars unaffordable. Governor Gavin Newsom replied that the president’s action was emblematic of “Trump’s all-out assault on California” and would “destroy our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process”. California Attorney-General Rob Bonta, who signed the 73-page complaint, said Congress had “no constitutional warrant” to meddle with waivers that for decades have been treated as executive, not legislative, instruments.

The lawsuit leans heavily on advice issued in March by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian (a neutral referee on matters of procedure), both of whom warned that the CRA cannot be used to nullify waivers awarded under the Clean Air Act. The claim argues that lawmakers “carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade notice-and-comment protections” and thereby sweep away rules that promise to cut exhaust emissions by 80% within a decade. The claimant states are therefore seeking an immediate injunction to reinstate the 2035 mandate, pointing out that more than a dozen states already follow California’s standards and had begun adjusting compliance plans.

Federal regulators were unmoved. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies,” said EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou in a statement. Automotive manufacturers were equally blunt, with the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, whose members include General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, praising the repeal as a “necessary reset”, and chief executive John Bozzella insisting Mr Trump had “stood up for customer choice and helped restore a degree of balance to US emissions regulations.”

EV TAX CREDITS BINNED

While the legal wrangling unfolds, a wider policy pivot is taking shape on Capitol Hill. The House of Representatives has already approved separate legislation that would scrap the federal USD 7,500 EV tax credit, introduce a USD 250 annual road-user fee for EVs and dilute corporate fuel-economy penalties; a companion Bill is pending in the Senate. Several analysts have warned that the twin assault on incentives and state standards could depress zero-emission uptake nationwide just as China and the EU pull ahead in clean-tech investment.

California hopes to secure a preliminary injunction before the summer recess, arguing that every month of regulatory uncertainty corrodes supply-chain planning. Whatever the initial outcome, most observers expect the fight to rise quickly to the Ninth Circuit and perhaps the Supreme Court, setting up a heavyweight clash over whether states may lead on climate policy when federal priorities change. An undeterred Mr Newsom has already ordered the California Air Resources Board to draft contingency rules that could be triggered if the courts deliver an unfavourable ruling.

ONGOING CONFLICT

The EV dispute is only the most recent front to have opened up in a year of legal trench warfare between Sacramento and Washington. Mr Newsom and Mr Bonta have already sued the administration over its sudden mobilisation of National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles during the ongoing immigration protests, with US District Judge Charles Breyer granting a temporary order to return command to the governor, though an appeals court has since issued a stay.

Still with immigration, in February San Francisco and 15 other “sanctuary” jurisdictions went to court to block an executive order that threatened to cut off federal funding unless local police assisted immigration agents. Last month US District Judge William Orrick agreed, ruling that the order would cause “irreparable injury” by imposing conditions that Congress never authorised.

California also leads a 16-state coalition challenging the Transport Department’s decision to freeze more than USD 3 billion in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure grants.

Taken together, the barrage of litigation underlines Mr Newsom’s readiness to wield the courts as a shield against policy reversals emanating from Washington. Whether the subject is clean air, public safety or immigration, California’s message is consistent: it will fight to preserve the progressive architecture it built over the past decade – and, in doing so, test the bounds of US federalism.",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/the-war-between-california-and-the-white-house-opens-a-new-front_0_124Xmu2tp9FnwQOoBGWY1YNsc8gaiy4nuwTAsEH8.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:01:56.549472

To make it simple, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is essentially a technique that allows impedance to be identified without the use of sensors.
As batteries consist of hundreds of cells arranged in series and interconnected, if some of them are damaged or age too quickly, the entire series is affected.
“But while in traditional systems you have a sensor that you just design once and use across different applications, with impedance spectroscopy, the cell itself becomes your sensor.","If you’ve attended “The Battery Show Europe” in Stuttgart, Germany, over the past few days, you may have come across a small demo car with a battery installed under the seat and 14 cells in series. At first glance, nothing extraordinary for Europe’s largest battery technology fair, this year themed “Driving sustainability, resilience and innovation in Europe’s battery industry.” Yet, if you looked a bit closer, you might have noticed a display showing a series of figures. The true innovation of this prototype lies precisely here: the data shown doesn’t just include the battery’s charge level, but also the state of health and temperature of each individual cell, thus promising to enhance safety, lifespan, and sustainability. It’s a “battery management system” (BMS), the electronic brain that controls the battery, which its developers have named zBMS. Its novelty lies in the “z” that precedes the traditional acronym. “For the industry and the scientific community, Z stands for the impedance,” explains Andreas Hutter, Leader of the Battery Systems group at the Swiss technology transfer center CSEM. To illustrate what that means, Hutter uses the image of an amount of water being pushed through a pipe: “The water flowing through the pipe represents an electric current, and the pressure pushing the water represents the voltage. Impedance in an electrical circuit is like the resistance to the flow of water in the pipe. If the diameter becomes smaller, the resistance to current flow increases. Similarly, in electrical terms, increased impedance reduces the amount of current that can flow.” In lithium-ion batteries, the current is essentially generated by electrons flowing between an anode, a negative electrode, and a cathode, a positive one, with ions moving back and forth to charge and discharge the battery. “It’s kind of a race, but full of hurdles, and any time they bump into an obstacle, some of them risk getting trapped or lost,” notes Hutter. And since every time this happens the battery’s capacity and performance are reduced, the first step toward improvement is to identify those obstacles. “Compared to today's practices, we measure this impedance at different frequencies, through a non-invasive technique called ‘impedance spectroscopy’ that allows us to make these obstacles visible, without opening the battery,” he adds.

Md Sazzad Hosen, Part-time Professor and Senior Battery Researcher at the Free University of Brussels (VUB), also coordinates NEMO, the European consortium behind the development of the zBMS. ""Thanks to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), you can have more precise information on the battery's performance and lifetime and predict if it's overheating, or posing safety concerns,” he says. To make it simple, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is essentially a technique that allows impedance to be identified without the use of sensors. “The first advantage is that you don’t need additional hardware,” says Jan Philipp Schmidt, Professor for Systems Engineering of Electrical Energy Storage Systems at the University of Bayreuth. “Adding a sensor inside a cell is already quite complex. Then, when it comes to temperature, for instance, sensors only measure it at a single point, whereas with impedance spectroscopy you can determine the temperature of the entire battery.”

One of the main benefits of applying this technique, according to the zBMS developers, is that it ensures good performance even in the case of some internal failures. As batteries consist of hundreds of cells arranged in series and interconnected, if some of them are damaged or age too quickly, the entire series is affected. “If in a battery module there are 15 cells, and two of them get damaged, the individual status check via impedance measurement and the cell management system will allow us to bypass them and rely on the remaining 13,” Hosen explains. “And this will ensure safe and reliable operation.” This is what experts call “balancing.” This process enables two things, clarifies Hutter: “First, we prolong the lifetime of the entire system by keeping all cells at the same health status and, second, we can use the hardware to spot and skip failing cells.”

Schmidt emphasises that further research is now crucial, but other barriers still hinder the widespread adoption of impedance-based battery management systems. “The technology is advancing very fast, and that’s good news,” he says. “But while in traditional systems you have a sensor that you just design once and use across different applications, with impedance spectroscopy, the cell itself becomes your sensor. This means that, yes, you can gather much richer and more detailed data, but also that every time a new generation of higher-performing cells is introduced, all this information needs to be validated from scratch.”",https://www.youris.com/pubimg/2196251/0/0/immagine_2_550x400.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:02.528014

South Africa is proving to be competitive in many areas… and time is of the essence,” said Winand.

If we fail at this, South Africa risks repeating the extractive pitfalls of the platinum sector, warned Tony Ehrenreich of trade union federation COSATU during a panel discussion at the Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town yesterday (12 June).

Ehrenreich emphasised that strategic industrial masterplans must avoid the historical pattern of exporting raw materials without local beneficiation.

‘Enlightened self-interest’ must drive clean energy sector

“Fifteen years ago, we didn’t have deliberate planning for the platinum industry. We exported the raw materials, imported high value-added products, and lost jobs, capacity and economic opportunity.

“Now, we have the chance to change that with renewable energy… but only through industrial democracy that involves workers, communities, business and government,” said Ehrenreich.

He warned that socio-economic transformation cannot be left to chance or to market forces.

“We can’t continue with the same economic players who dominated before 1994. There must be a deliberate plan for transformation… not as charity, but as enlightened self-interest,” he said.

South Africa must address socio-economic fault lines

Ehrenreich noted that failure to address inequality in South Africa could lead to social and economic instability. “We’ve already seen what happened in the mining sector when unrest broke out. It shut down the economy. If we don’t get this right, the same could happen again.”

He also cautioned against focusing solely on export markets while neglecting domestic demand, pointing out that widespread poverty remains a key constraint.

“Forty percent of people in our country don’t have enough food in their stomachs. If people have no disposable income, there’s no demand for electricity, fridges, or stoves… and no driver for industrial growth,” he said.

Ehrenreich called for greater oversight of public funding in the green economy to prevent elite capture, pointing to corruption in sectors like steel, bread and construction.

“Public funds must deliver public benefit. That means a different approach, not one where we simply follow industry’s lead.”

Candice Moodley, Corporate Services Executive at the Energy and Water Sector Education and Training Authority (EWSETA) emphasised that skills development must be prioritised if South Africa is to build a competitive and equitable renewable energy economy.

“The South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM) is a critical blueprint for localisation, economic growth and inclusive participation. But at the heart of it must be the localisation of skills.

“A just transition means no one is left behind.. especially historically marginalised groups like women and youth.”

She noted that public training institutions, particularly TVET colleges, are currently ill-equipped to meet the pace of the energy transition.

“Our colleges lack the capacity to train learners in emerging technologies because lecturers themselves haven’t been exposed to them. The green hydrogen economy gives us a chance to change that… to be agile and responsive.”

Programmes aim to fill the skills gap in South Africa

However, Moodley highlighted recent progress, including the launch of the Green Hydrogen Skills Framework by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET), which maps out skills needed across the hydrogen value chain – from production to transport and storage.

EWSETA is currently developing full qualifications focused on fuel cells, solar PV installation, battery storage, and micro-grid management, as well as career pathways from artisan to professional engineer in the hydrogen economy.

Moodley also announced the launch of the Global Green Hydrogen Mentorship Platform, in collaboration with the Department of Higher Education and Training and the Department of Science and Innovation. The platform will connect South African trainees with international experts to build skills and share best practices.

“This is exactly what our market needs. A place where mentors and mentees can connect and help drive the sector forward,” she said.

Clean energy masterplan’s localisation of skills focus

Samantha Graham-Maré, South Africa’s Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy also stressed the importance of skills to service the renewable energy sector.

“We can’t talk about localisation if our wind turbines have to be repaired overseas, or if we have to wait months for imported components to get our goods back online,” she said.

From certified technicians to regional spares hubs and mobile diagnostics teams, Graham-Maré said the services and maintenance industry was essential not only to reliability but to job creation.

“These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. You can’t fly someone in from abroad to come and service a wind turbine in the Karoo. We need people locally.”

South Africa, she noted, already has companies doing this work. “What they need now is volume… a consistent project pipeline to justify investment in facilities, staff and training. SAREM gives them that confidence.”

Local manufacturing of green hydrogen infrastructure – from electrolysers to fuel cells – should be supported by SAREM, not as a niche activity but “as the norm.”

“All of this, from renewables to storage to hydrogen, depends on one thing: people. Infrastructure doesn’t build itself. Markets don’t train artisans. Skills don’t emerge by accident.”

Building strong supply chains in South Africa

Janek Winand, South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) Board Member said skills development is a critical area.

“Yes, the REIPPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme) may not have delivered on all its original promises, but it has still created a significant number of jobs. The industry is growing so fast that companies are competing for the same skilled individuals.”

“Even if some main components weren’t originally manufactured in South Africa, there is now a surge in demand for spare parts and services.

“That’s where real job creation is happening. We are seeing local SMEs thriving, building strong supply chains, and creating thousands of jobs. South Africa is proving to be competitive in many areas… and time is of the essence,” said Winand.

Renewable energy sector as a key skills, jobs driver in South Africa

Rethabile Melamu, the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) CEO, said the organisation believes the sector has immense potential to create jobs through industrialisation in the renewable energy value chain.

“Initially, I think we were solving for an energy security challenge without comprehensively considering the other socio-economic benefits that renewable energy technologies can offer.

“We have contributed. I don’t believe that the jobs created so far have been unsustainable. On the contrary, the greatest number of jobs have come from the deployment of renewable energy technologies.”

Melamu said South Africa needs to “industrialise not just for our own local market, but also for export.”

Drilling would jeopardize one of the world’s last unspoiled places at a time when we should be shifting to alternative clean energy to reduce the effects of global climate change (and help Iowa’s economy).

It is disappointing that both of Iowa’s Senators support opening the refuge to drilling. One of their reasons is that oil drilling would affect only about 2,000 acres of the coastal plain, but this is not correct. Activities would not be restricted to one block. Drilling and connecting infrastructure would extend to every corner of the refuge, impacting the entire coastal plain that has been called “America’s Serengeti” because of the large herds of caribou and other wildlife that use the area.

It has also been stated that new drilling techniques would lessen impacts. These techniques should be tried first in the parts of the nearby National Petroleum Reserve where oil drilling is already allowed to determine if they work before they are used in the fragile coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

A better approach would be to expand the development of alternative energy, of which Iowa is already a national leader. The best way to do this is to preserve the clean energy tax credits that were authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act but are under threat in Trump’s bill. Senators Grassley and Ernst are urged to support clean energy, which they have championed for a long time, instead of opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.
